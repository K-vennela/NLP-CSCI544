*NEW VIDEO: Telemundo Las Vegas On Catherine Cortez Masto College
Affordability Roundtable*

<<<link>>>*

Las Vegas, NV =E2=80=93 Earlier this week, former Nevada Attorney General a=
nd U.S.
Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto held a college affordability
roundtable with college students from southern Nevada. But while Cortez
Masto is focused on making college more affordable for Nevada students, her
opponents, Sharron Angle and Congressman Heck, would follow the lead of
their party=E2=80=99s bosses in Washington in putting billionaires like the=
 Koch
Brothers ahead of Nevada students and working families.

Congressman Heck has consistently voted with his party to make college more
expensive for Nevada students. He has voted multiple times for reckless
Republican budgets that cut Pell grants for 35,000 Nevada students and even
voted to increase student loan interest rates.

=E2=80=9CTime and again Congressman Heck has voted to make college more exp=
ensive
for Nevada students,=E2=80=9D said Zach Hudson, spokesperson for Catherine =
Cortez
Masto for Senate. =E2=80=9CFortunately, Nevada students have a choice betwe=
en a
bipartisan problem solver like Catherine Cortez Masto, who will work across
the aisle to make college more affordable for Nevada students, and a
politician like Sharron Angle or Congressman Heck, who would side with
their party bosses in Washington and make college even more expensive for
Nevada students and graduates.=E2=80=9D

*Background:*

*Heck Voted For House Republican Budget That Would Cut Spending By $5.5
Trillion Over 10 Years. *In March 2015, Heck voted for: =E2=80=9CAdoption o=
f the
concurrent resolution that would provide for $2.937 trillion in new budget
authority in fiscal 2016, not including off-budget accounts. It would
assume $5.5 trillion in spending reductions over the next 10 years,
including by assuming repeal of the 2015 healthcare law. It also would
propose reducing spending on Medicare and Medicaid and changing programs
such as food stamps. It would call for restructuring Medicare into a
=E2=80=98premium support=E2=80=99 system beginning in 2024, call for a defi=
cit-neutral
overhaul of the tax code that lowers rates and assume $147 billion in
additional savings through =E2=80=98dynamic scoring,=E2=80=99 and would inc=
lude
instructions to committees to trigger the budget reconciliation process to
cut mandatory spending. The resolution would call for fiscal 2015 base
discretionary spending that adheres to the sequester-reduced defense and
non-defense caps set by the Budget Control Act, and for future years it
would assume a 10-year increase in defense caps of $387 billion while
calling for cutting non-defense caps by $759 billion. As amended, for
fiscal 2015 it would call for allowing $96 billion in uncapped war-related
funding to provide additional defense funding beyond sequester-reduced
caps, without requiring offsets.=E2=80=9D The bill was adopted by a vote of
228-199. [CQ, 3/25/15 <<<link>>>; H. Con. Res. 27,

=C2=B7 *Republican Budget Eliminates Mandatory Funding For Pell Grants And
Freezes Grants At Their Current Level Instead Of Keeping Pace With
Inflation. *=E2=80=9CThe Republican budgets eliminate mandatory funding for=
 Pell
Grants, and the House budget specifies that it would freeze the maximum
grant at its current level, instead of allowing it to increase to keep pace
with inflation. Over time, this would reduce financial aid for almost all
of the more than 8 million students who rely on Pell Grants to afford
college.=E2=80=9D [White House Report, Republican Budget Resolutions: Same =

years, even as tuition and room and board costs will continue to rise.  It
also eliminates Pell Grant funding on the mandatory side of the budget
(Pell Grants receive both mandatory and discretionary funding, as explained
below), likely forcing further cuts in eligibility and benefits.  In
addition, it would make student loans more expensive and cut other
education and training programs (see box).=E2=80=9D [Center on Budget and P=

borrowers who lost access to subsidized loans would pay interest on

2014=E2=80=932015 academic year instead borrowed the same amount through
unsubsidized loans, that student would leave school with additional debt of
about $3,800 because of the accrued interest costs. Over a typical 10-year
repayment period, the student=E2=80=99s monthly payment would be $43 higher=
 than if
he or she had borrowed that same amount through subsidized loans.=E2=80=9D

*Heck Voted For GOP Student Loan Bill That Would Raise Student Loan
Interest Rates When Treasury Rates Rise. *In May 2013, Heck voted for:
=E2=80=9CUnder the GOP proposal, student loans would be reset every year, p=
egged to
10-year Treasury notes with added percentage points. For instance, students
who receive subsidized or unsubsidized Stafford student loans would pay the
Treasury rate, plus 2.5 percentage points starting for loans issued after J=
uly
1. Current subsidized Stafford loans are offered at a fixed 3.4 percent
rate and unsubsidized Stafford loans are offered at 6.8 percent. The
interest rate on loans to parents and graduate students is 7.9 percent.
Using Congressional Budget Office projections, the GOP plan would translate
to a 5 percent interest rate on all Stafford loans in 2014, but the rate
would climb to 7.7 percent for loans in 2023. =E2=80=98We're ripping off ki=
ds,=E2=80=99
said Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt. Stafford loan rates would be capped at 8.5
percent, while loans for parents and graduate students would have a 10.5
percent ceiling under the GOP plan.=E2=80=9D [Associated Press, 5/24/13
