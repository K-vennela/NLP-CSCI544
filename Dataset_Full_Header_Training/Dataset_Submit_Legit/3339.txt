It ended up @ 1.8mil last night for 1825 theaters playing late shows starting at 7pm . A great start vs our comps Ride Along ( 1.06mil starting at 8pm ) and TLAM #1 ( 550k starting at 12:01 ) .
 Now the fun part . TLAM #1 did 12mil on Fri on the way to its 33.6mil opening . Ride Along did 14.4mil ( incl Thurs late shows ) on the way to its 41.5mil FSS portion of MLK weekend . 
 We'll be comparing all day long and hopefully ending up in those very nice neighborhoods . 

 Jersey Boys , by the way sat this round out and started at 12:01am doing @ 50k .
