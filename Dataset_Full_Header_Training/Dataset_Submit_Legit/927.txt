Dem party chief's response to 'throwing shade' remark? '#SMH'
By Rebecca Savransky
Organization Chairwoman (DNC) Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Wednesday had a simple response to Bernie Sanders<<<link>>>'s campaign manager after Jeff Weaver said she had been "throwing shade" at the Vermont Senator's campaign.
"My response to that is #SMH," Wasserman Schultz said on CNN. "SMH" is an acronym used to mean "shaking my head," often meant to show someone does not agree with something said.
Weaver earlier Wednesday slammed<<<link>>> the Wasserman Schultz, saying she was disrespecting the Vermont senator's presidential campaign.
"We could have a long conversation just about Debbie Wasserman Schultz and how she's been throwing shade at the Sanders campaign since the very beginning," Weaver said on CNN.
Wasserman Schultz had said earlier that Sanders's response to the chaos at last weekend's Nevada Democratic Convention was unacceptable. She said the Sanders campaign didn't adequately condemn the violence from its supporters.
On Wednesday afternoon, Wasserman Schultz said the party needs to focus on getting through the primary and then working to prepare for the general election.
"And make sure that we can continue to draw the contrast between either one of our really fine candidates who are focused on helping people reach the middle class and make sure that we get equal pay for equal work and create jobs," she said.
"And not let the Republicans take healthcare away from 20 million Americans, do everything we can to make sure Donald Trump<<<link>>> never becomes president of the United States."
Wasserman Schultz said she is singularly focused on making sure a Democrat wins the White House and won't let anything else distract her.
