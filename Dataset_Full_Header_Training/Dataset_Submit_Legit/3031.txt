FYI, asked the NV Dems Comms Director for a read-out of how the Convention =
is going, and he passed this message along:

The passing of the rules and initial credentials report was extremely conte=
ntious this morning as expected, but things have chilled out now. We have t=
he Sanders folks admitting that they lost fair and square, not because we "=
rigged" anything. Clinton likely to win the state convention with a slim ma=
rgin and we'll send a release with final delegate numbers.
