*On 4th Anniversary of Congressman Heck Calling Social Security a =E2=80=9C=
Pyramid
Scheme,=E2=80=9D Catherine Cortez Masto Meets With Northern NV Seniors to D=
iscuss
Importance of Preserving Benefits for Nevada Seniors*

*Cortez Masto would fight to protect Social Security as Nevada=E2=80=99s Se=
nator,
unlike her opponent Congressman Heck*

Reno, NV =E2=80=93 Today, former Nevada Attorney General and U.S. Senate ca=
ndidate
Catherine Cortez Masto visited the Washoe County Senior Services Center to
speak with Northern Nevada seniors about the need to protect and preserve
crucial programs like Social Security. Cortez Masto=E2=80=99s domain.com came on=
 the 4th
anniversary of her opponent, Congressman Heck, calling Social Security a
=E2=80=9Cpyramid scheme=E2=80=9D that "isn=E2=80=99t working."

Congressman Heck has even called for Social Security to be privatized,
putting the very people who crashed our economy in control of the
retirement security of Nevada seniors. While Congressman Heck compares
Social Security to a criminal enterprise, Catherine Cortez Masto has a
proven record of protecting Nevada seniors. As Nevada=E2=80=99s Attorney Ge=
neral,
Cortez Masto created a special domain.com to go after scam artists who target
seniors. As Nevada=E2=80=99s next Senator, Cortez Masto will work with both=
 parties
to strengthen Social Security and will fight any attempts by Washington
Republicans to privatize it.

=E2=80=9CSocial Security is not a =E2=80=98pyramid scheme=E2=80=99 -- it=E2=
=80=99s a program Nevada seniors
rely on for their retirement security,=E2=80=9D said Cortez Masto. =E2=80=
=9CWe must protect
and strengthen Social Security for future generations, not allow Washington
Republicans like Congressman Heck to recklessly subject seniors=E2=80=99 re=
tirement
security to the whims of Wall Street. However, this requires putting
partisan differences aside and working together to solve problems --
something that Congressman Heck, who believes Social Security is a =E2=80=
=9Cpyramid
scheme,=E2=80=9D has not accomplished during his half a decade in Washingto=
n. I
know how to solve problems for Nevadans and will fight for the programs
that our seniors rely on for their economic security."
