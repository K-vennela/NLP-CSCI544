Hi team, we=92d like to turn these talking points into a Medium post from B=
rad Marshall, our CFO. What do you think?

  *   The suggestion there=92s anything unusual about our joint victory fun=
ds has no basis in the law or reality, as recognized by numerous independen=
t experts that have looked at this.
  *   Our joint victory funds are in complete compliance with FEC regulatio=
ns.
  *   And they=92re exactly what we=92ve done for past election cycles. I k=
now, I was here in the 90s when we organized joint funds across Democratic =
committees, and when we leveraged similar committees with the John Kerry ca=
mpaign in 2004.
  *   By 2008, with an extended primary, we actually had a joint victory fu=
nd in which both the Obama and Clinton campaigns collaborated, raising the =
Party nearly $10 million in May and June of that year. After then-Senator O=
bama secured the nomination in June, we set up the victory fund with just h=
is campaign. And we did it again in 2012.
  *   The fact is both campaigns signed on to similar agreements, and there=
=92s nothing wrong with how they are set up or used. The unfortunate claims=
 being made about these funds is what=92s wrong.
  *   While only one campaign is currently using their joint victory fund w=
e encourage both of our campaigns to identify opportunities to support the =
national and state Democratic parties now so that we can continue to build =
the infrastructure to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Novemb=
er.

=B7         The money raised by the joint victory funds, even when the mone=
y goes to the DNC, still helps state parties. The funds help strengthen, fo=
r example, our national voter file and communications, research and digital=
 support for state parties and down ballot candidates. That includes traini=
ng across a variety of areas, for example, and access to media monitoring a=
nd rapid response support. This is helping the Party right NOW build the in=
frastructure we need for the general election.

=B7         Politico got it wrong. Their claim that state parties only get =
to keep 1 percent of all the money being raised is incorrect and comparing =
apples and oranges. They reference the total amount of money that has been =
raised, but of that, many millions have been raised for state parties and j=
ust haven=92t been distributed to them yet (nor has it gone to the Organizationor a=
nywhere else). Because this is money for the general election, and coordina=
ted campaigns are just now starting to be built at state parties, it is per=
fectly understandable that not all of the HVF money owed to state parties w=
ould have been distributed yet.

=B7         We had JFA=92 s with the Obama campaigns in 2015 and 2012, and =
the Kerry campaign in 2004. And while the funds are going to the Organizationright =
now to build tools and capacity for the general election, there will be a p=
oint when the funds stay in the states to fund coordinated campaigns that a=
re now beginning to get organized.

=B7         That=92s why experts have agreed there=92s nothing unusual abou=
t the victory funds. Rick Hasen, an influential academic on campaign financ=
e, posted an analysis on the Election Law Blog that addressed this issue. H=
asen states in the article that =93it is hard to see what provision of the =
law=94 is at issue. As the blog points out, =93legally=94 the criticism of =
the fund =93seems weak.=94   <<link>><<<link>>

=B7         We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for=
 the Organizationand state parties.

=B7         Similar agreements were set up with both the Clinton campaign a=
nd the Sanders campaign early in the cycle, precisely because of the urgenc=
y to build a strong national infrastructure now that will help elect Democr=
ats up and down the ballot in November. The Sanders campaign has not used t=
heirs.

=B7         These arrangements are not new or unusual. Similar joint fundra=
ising committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 200=
8 and 2012. And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of=
 using joint victory funds.

=B7         And let=92s be clear, neither the Organizationnor state parties are sub=
sidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign. For what=
ever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campa=
ign, that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that=
 fundraising.
