Subject: Preparations for Trump?

Hey guys,

Happy Sunday.

I didn't get a chance to write about the charirwoman's comments at the Ala=
ska convention this morning - I'm stretched thin, filling in for our repor=
ter who normally covers the Sunday shows while she's on vacation and on a =
flight to Puerto Rico to cover the election - but I'd really like to do a =
piece working off of her speech that details what the Organizationis doing to prep=
are for Trump.

If there's anything you could share, I'd be happy to do this over email or=
 over the phone. The piece I have in mind would strictly deal with what th=
e national party is doing so it can be prepared unlike Republicans, as the=
 chairwoman mentioned.

Thanks, please let me know if this is something you can help with, or if y=
ou have any other story ideas for me. My colleague comes back Tuesday, so =
I'll be back on my own beat and on the hunt for good content!
