Can we pull the video version that aired on the networks, please? Not sure who carried most of it.

Very tepid endorsement for Cruz. Pence went out of his way to praise Trump. He also didn't urge the people of Indiana to vote for Cruz and said that he's for "anybody" but Hillary/Bernie.

--

Pence on Cruz endorsement:

This is an exciting time for Indiana-to have candidates travel across the state. I'm grateful that all the candidates are coming through the state.

This is a time for choosing. I like and respect all three Republican candidates. I particularly want to commend Trump who has given voice to the frustration of millions of America. I'm grateful that Trump has taken a stance on Hossier jobs-Carrier.

I'm not against anybody, but I will be voting for Cruz in the Republican primary.

On why he's supporting Cruz, Pence said he's a Reagan conservative. Goes on to talk about his admiration for Reagan. I tend to support men and women who support Regan principles. Calls Cruz a conservative.

Pence: I'm very impressed to Ted Cruz's knowledge and devotion to the constitution. Also highlights his support for the sanctity of life.

Pence: Cruz has shown the courage of his convictions. Not a popular thing to take on the leadership of his own party. Whoever wins the nomination, I'm going to work my heart out for them.

Pence: "I'm for anybody" but Hillary and Bernie Sanders.

Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Pence plans to endorse Ted Cruz for president on Friday, Fox News has learned.

Texas Sen. Cruz did not publicly confirm the endorsement when asked by reporters Friday morning, but praised Pence's leadership of the state.
