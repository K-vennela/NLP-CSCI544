OrganizationChair Statement on Republican Senator Admitting Senate Republicans Shou=
ld do Their Job on Supreme Court

WASHINGTON - OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following s=
tatement on Senator Jeff Flake's comments on Meet the Press yesterday that =
if Republicans lose the presidential election they "ought to approve [Chief=
 Judge Garland] quickly:"

"Senator Flake's comments yesterday are a reminder that Republicans are pla=
ying political games with the Supreme Court. Chief Judge Garland is the mos=
t qualified nominee to immediately serve on the Supreme Court with more fed=
eral judicial experience than any other nominee in history, he should get a=
 fair hearing and a vote. That the GOP has nominated a reckless and dangero=
us candidate in Donald Trump who lacks the temperament and judgment to serv=
e -- much less appoint a Supreme Court justice -- should be enough for Repu=
blicans in the Senate to do their job now, not recklessly leave a Supreme C=
ourt seat unfilled until November."

Just revise by adding the chair's "not recklessly" close to the statement a=
nd it is good to send.

See below:

ly leave a Supreme Court seat unfilled until November."
