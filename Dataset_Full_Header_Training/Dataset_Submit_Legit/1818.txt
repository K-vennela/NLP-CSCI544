*Another Day, Another Republican Rejects Trump=E2=80=99s Unpredictable, Ris=
ky and
Divisive Candidacy*

Day after day since Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee
for president, Republicans and conservative commentators continue to reject
his unpredictable, risky and divisive candidacy. Donald Trump has for years
proven himself to be a loose cannon whose hateful language and dangerous
policies will do serious harm to working families and put America=E2=80=99s
security at risk, and Republicans are continuing to acknowledge that a
President Trump would be too big a risk.

*Read the growing list
<<<link>>

of Republicans unwilling to support a President Donald Trump and fresh
condemnations of Trump:*

*Rosario Marin, former U.S. Treasurer under President George W. Bush

"I have been the spokesperson for five presidential Republican campaigns. I
have attended the previous five Republican national conventions. I=E2=80=99=

ever vote for the little orange man.=E2=80=9D

*Jennifer Rubin: Who wants to defend Trump for the next six months?

*"Donald Trump=E2=80=99s noxious behavior and erratic views force his suppo=
rters to
condone all sorts of unacceptable things. Even his own advisers find it
hard to excuse his conduct."

*Rep. Tim Huelskamp [R-KS]
<<<link>>>*: "I can't get
comfortable with a candidate if I'm worried about what he'll say in front
of my 9-year old that's vulgar and crass. I cannot have him in front of
that television with what Donald Trump has been saying."

*Andrew Weinstein, deputy press secretary to then-House Speaker Newt
Gingrich: Five Reasons My Fellow Republicans Should Vote for Hillary
Clinton
<<<link>>

"The best way to save the GOP is a Clinton victory. A Trump win could
create an institutional bond between the GOP and the racist demagoguery and
proposals Mr. Trump has espoused while simultaneously abandoning the
party=E2=80=99s positive messages of inclusion, growth, prosperity, and ind=

*Doug Heye, Former RNC communications director*
<<<link>>>: "That's one of the things that troubles so
many people on the Republican side about Donald Trump. There are no policy
specifics. There are no real solutions. As you mentioned, there are tons of
villains, you can pick a different villain of the day. But there aren't
serious policy solutions."

*RGA Finance Chair Fred Malek
<<<link>>>*: =E2=80=
=9CHe
seems to be taking the position that -- 'Hey, he's the nominee so you've
got to get behind him.' Well, it doesn't work that way.=E2=80=9D
