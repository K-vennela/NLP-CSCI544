Yes. We can debunk. While money has obviously been spent for fundraising co=
sts (which is absolutely necessary in order to raise the 60 million dollars=
 they keep referencing!) there are millions of dollars still sitting in HVF=
 that are allocated to the Organizationand the state parties (and therefore have to=
 be transferred to the Organizationand the state parties) that have not yet been di=
stributed because the point of the party portion of HVF is to raise money t=
o fund the general election. This isn't right and it seems to me that we sh=
ould say that. Let me reach out to see if I can get hard numbers on how muc=
h is left.
