More Ohio ideas:

-          Hold a presser on the climate change/the environment somewhere near the Cuyahoga River, calling attention to Trump’s vow to dismantle EPA - according to OH history-

11. The Cuyahoga River has caught on fire at least 13 times;<<<link>>> it’s aptly nicknamed “The River That Caught Fire.” The river was one of the most polluted rivers in the country and would catch fire after sparks from the train would fall into the water. After a highly media-covered fire in 1969, Congress was inspired to clean up pollution across the country and established<<<link>>> the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

-          Hand out placards with Trump’s face superimposed on the World’s Largest Cuckoo Clock (housed in Sugarcreek, OH) <<link>>

-          Still fleshing this one out, Thomas Edison was born in Milan, OH. Hand out lightbulbs.. b/c the “lightbulb” hasn’t gone off yet with the GOP.. something like that..

Counter Convention Plan Sketch
[<<link>>]
Overview

The Republican National Convention will take place in Cleveland, Ohio from Monday, July 18 through Thursday, July 21, 2016. Our operationwill consist of a campaign on the ground in Cleveland, from Headquarters, and in battleground and other states to amplify a message that sets the record straight on what viewers will see at the convention.

The plan begins with setting the tone in Cleveland before the convention kicks off with activities previewing the most likely and most outrageous falsehoods we expect to hear at the RNC.

We will deploy a core team to Cleveland to establish a fixed location for daily press conferences, as well as a mobile rapid response hub for special events. A rotating cast of senior party leaders and officials will participate each day in our events, and we will pair party leaders and elected officials with real people whose stories reflect what’s at stake in the coming election.

We will also lay the groundwork with state parties to hold events that include notable officials and real people in their key markets to echo our message and set themes of the day. We will integrate these activities into a social media campaign to deliver content about everything we’re doing to as large an audience as possible.

We also intend to produce advertising for Cleveland and key markets to coincide with specific themes each day, which will include both radio and online advertising.[<<link>>]

Message Summary
#DemCentral and #DemMobile Rapid Response Hubs

We propose having a fixed office space that enables us to hold press conferences, host breakfasts, and serve as our war room, ideally situated close to the center of the Republican convention’s activities.

In addition, we propose having a mobile rapid response hub (a wrapped RV) to serve as a mobile billboard, backdrop for events at different locations, and green room to prepare staff, validators, and real people in advance of any events. It can also serve as a meeting space for one-on-one interviews. The RNC used a similar prop to great effect at one of our conventions. It provides mobility, which is key to going to reporters when they can’t come to you, and the ability to reach press from outside states that attend state-delegation breakfasts/activities.

Staffing
RNC Summer Meeting 7/11 - 7/16

The RNC Summer Meeting will be held in Cleveland the week before the convention and include meetings of their Rules Committee and Platform Committee. As these meetings could generate a lot of press--and it is likely that a solid contingent of the press corp will be on the ground in advance of them--it may be prudent to send a few staff down to monitor and respond to things happening on the ground.

The Platform Committee will meet at the beginning of the week, and the Rules Committee will meet in the later part of the week.

Notes:

SEIU has office space in downtown Cleveland close to convention that can be the base of operations and host the wrapped mobile RV.

Live-staged activities on-site:

*         Jerry Springer “Live” fake show between Trump/Cruz/Kasich delegates - Jerry said he wanted to be involved

*         Fake debate between Trump and Cruz

*         Cleveland / Ohio delegation presser

*         House Tri-Caucus chairs press conference (CBC, CHC, CAPAC) - plus women’s caucus, LGBT caucus

Off-site activities:

*         Find a structurally-deficient bridge, have surrogates discuss how Republicans have fallen down on the job when it comes to infrastructure funding

o    Would need top-line surrogates for this - Anthony Foxx / Tom Perez

*         Infiltrate friendly union hotels and properties around the convention that Republicans will be patronizing to distribute “care” packages

*         Bracket Rob Portman’s “mini-convention”: <<link>>

o    Get other Senators asked if they will boycott convention if Trump or Cruz is set to be the nominee

*         Pick one day to have press conferences in every media market in Ohio.

o    Message: While the Rs might be having fun bribing each other in Cleveland, Democrats are focused on the needs of Ohioans across the state.

*         Fast food worker strike around the city or just at franchises around convention.

*         Voter registration drive

Gimmicks to hand out:

*         Bribe packages<<<link>>> for delegates - “Cruz Cruises,” Trump steaks, Vodka, Water, etc., monopoly money, tickets to Trump’s failed USFL football team

*         “That’s why you leave a little tip<<<link>>>” envelopes - for Kasich’s comments about hotel workers - work with Hotel Trades on this

*         Bottles of dirty water from Sebring, OH<<<link>>> (had a lead crisis under Kasich’s watch a la Flint)

*         Care packages for folks who will be sick after Trump / Cruz nomination - with single-serve Advil, Alka-Seltzer, Pepto Bismol, Vitamin C

*         Reporter swag bag?

*         Clothespins so delegates can hold their nose voting for Trump/Cruz

*         Milk cartons with GOP faces - local Wisconsin farm

Paid Media:

*         Banner ads in the airport

*         Billboards on the highway from the airport to Quicken Loans Arena

*         Ads in restaurants and bars around town

*         Have places doing “drink specials”

Other ideas:

*         See if any Cavaliers, Browns, or Indians players would be interested in bracketing

*         WH / Administration ask - can they send any topline surrogates / domain.com secretaries?

*         Send letters to major companies who are boycotting RNC that they can invest in Organizationand not be embarrassed (can work in companies leaving GOP states over social policies like Indiana Religious Freedom Act and HB2 in North Carolina)

*         Volunteers / interns in Trump costumes performing Trump things

*         Concert / Rock the Vote
