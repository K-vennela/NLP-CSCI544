Has also bragged about his poll numbers going up after mass shootings

TRUMP BOASTED HIS POLL NUMBERS WENT UP AFTER MASS SHOOTINGS

Trump: "Every Time There Is A Horrible Act ... My Poll Numbers Go Up." TRUMP: "It is interesting, because every time there is a horrible act, and this is a shame in many respects, but from the standpoint of what happens, every time a really bad act takes place, like Paris -- it happened with Paris, it happens now -- my cold and was go up - my poll numbers go up. Look, I'm going to be tough, going to be strong, and people can't get away with the kind of stuff they are getting away with no. We have to be smart, have to have borders, have to have restricted military, take care of our vets." [With All Due Respect, Bloomberg, 12/4/15]

12/3/15: Donald Trump Retweeted A Claim That His "Poll Numbers Jump Every Time Instances Like This Occur" The Morning After A Mass Shooting Killed 14 And Injured 17 In San Bernardino, California. "Donald Trump's retweeting habits leave something to be desired. ... Early Thursday morning, Trump did it again. This time, he retweeted a supporter who pretty clearly appeared to suggest that the shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., on Wednesday - shootings that killed 14 and injured 17 - would help Trump's 'poll numbers.' ''@DLake66675: @ChateauEmissary @trumpettes16 @realDonaldTrump his poll numbers jump every time instances like this occur.' The tweet is a pretty clear reference to the San Bernardino shootings, [and] The man Trump retweeted made his feelings on the connection between the shootings and Trump's poll numbers even clearer in a previous tweet." [The Fix, Washington Post, 12/3/15<<<link>>>; @realDonaldTrump, Twitter, 12/3/15<<<link>>>]

I would like to push this portion around OTR - let me know if you have any objections.

Video request coming shortly.

Do you regret saying that [about McCain]?

-          "I like not to regret anything"

-          "What I said, frankly, is what I said. Some people like what I said, to know the truth. There are many people who like what I said. After I said that, my poll numbers went up seven points."

Listen here<<<link>>>

See exchange on POWs and McCain

-          TRUMP: "Some people like what I said, to know the truth. There are many people who like what I said. After I said that, my poll numbers went up seven points."

Trump on Imus in the Morning:

We will raise a lot of money. $1 billion or $1.5 billion.

-          I spend less than anybody else

-          I know how to spend it. Maybe that's why people like me

Putting yourself in a position to take money from people and groups that will expect things?

-          "Well they are really paying-any money  is going to be paid to the party. So I'm not taking money, but the party will take money, and the party will support me and other people."

-          The party will also be spending on Senators, etc.

Meeting with Paul Ryan? Just you and him? Or Staff?

-          Don't know him. Only met him one time

-          "Might be" just him and I. But he probably has a few people that he feels comfortable having

-          He probably wants to get to know me a little bit

You should offer him VP slot to throw him off

-          He wouldn't want it

-          Speaker slot was already hard enough to fill

Tyson said "everybody has a plan until they get punched." Clintons didn't expect Bernie challenge. Are they prepared?

-          HRC can't make great trade deals

-          Libya, Benghazi were a disaster. So many things she handled so badly

-          She wants to abolish the 2nd amendment. She essentially wants to abolish the 2nd amendment and take guns away

-          I will eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. Other countries are ripping us off

When you get to Oval Office, will you find that things are harder to get done than expected?

-          There will be some of that.

-          But I've been involved in politics at the highest level for a long time, just not on this side

-          Obama can't get things done

What level of income represents the middle class?

-          One way to describe is people that have been absolutely disenfranchised

-          Different levels in different places

-          In NYC, middle class person would be considered wealthy in other cities

-          Have to be consequences for companies leaving

John McCain wants apology for the POWs?

-          I've actually done that

-          I like John McCain. McCain is a hero.

-          All POWs are heros, whether or not they are captured

Do you regret saying that [about McCain]?

-          "I like not to regret anything"

-          "What I said, frankly, is what I said. Some people like what I said, to know the truth. There are many people who like what I said. After I said that, my poll numbers went up seven points."

Someone who avoided draft through deferments shouldn't say that?

-          College deferments. Great lottery numbers

-          I do feel bad... that's why I was involved in building Vietnam memorial in NY

-          Vietnam War was a mistake. Just like Iraq

Family's role in your campaign. Role in your administration?

-          Probably not

-          A little thing called nepotism that is not very good

-          They will be running the business

Obama going to Hiroshima.

-          He should not apologize.

-          His going there does not bother me

-          Reminds people of the tremendous power of nuclear

-          Should not apologize in any way, shape, or form
