However, we understand very well your requirement but unfortunately we can’t apply to it and provide you with a specific payment for withholding tax against the services purchased from your company, simply because we pay periodically the withholding tax on more one project/business gathered together and do not pay on each specific purchase, contract or client or service. It will be easier for us that your company handle recovering the paid amounts but this can’t happen due to the above justification.  So we can’t just domain.com to your company a sole withholding tax payment done to Zakat department in relation with the services and the license we purchased from your side.I hope this issue is now clarified. On the other hand, and in regard with the remaining (50%), I clarified within my below email that it will be paid within (5) working days upon the immediate return back for services to our Customer. So I also hope that what I confirmed in regard the remaining (50%) is applicable to you, hoping to return back the service to our customer without any further delays, and allow me to thank you for your nice gesture which is indeed  highly appreciated. Thank you again & Best regards,    SALEM H.

Subject: Re: Replying email Dear Salem.

thank you for the clarification but we never asked TCC to pay/recover taxes on our behalf: we simply asked to provide evidence that this taxes has been paid so that we can recover it (with a compensation mechanism) from our local tax declaration. However, since in 2 years we have not received any evidence of such tax payment from your side we are forced to ask you to pay the outstanding amount. 

Again, it is a simply accounting operation but we need paper document to do it and so far we have not in the position to properly register the outstanding amount: so how do you suggest we will threat the remaining 50%? Are you going to provide us certification of the tax payment performed in KSA? 

As a gesture of good faith, we are going to extend for 15 days the license of the client waiting for collection of the amount and your input on how deal with the remaining 50%,

Best regards,

Giancarlo

As I mentioned previously we can recover the withholded tax from our local tax declaration if there is a document stating that you have paid this amount in KSA. More importantly we did not provide any delegaOn 4/13/2015 1:12 PM, Salem H.

TCC-LPO-0026-09-12-V5 dated 26.09.2012 approved by your company.Furthermore, and as for the obtained tax exemption received from your company, please be informed that we submitted the exemption on behalf of your company to recover the paid withholding tax and the recovery is still under process.
