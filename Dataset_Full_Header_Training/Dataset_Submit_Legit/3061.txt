Congrats on Sound of Music, great number.  Quick question on President's Day weekend.  I know we all talked about being together in Montana, but I noticed that it overlapped with the Olympics.  Are we still on or should we reschedule as you will be in the semi tropical resort of Sochi?  Hope to see you guys soon. Michael
