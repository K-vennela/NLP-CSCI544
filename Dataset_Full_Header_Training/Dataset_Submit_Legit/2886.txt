Dear OrganizationMember,

This week, Ted Cruz and John Kasich announced that they have their suspended campaigns, and Donald Trump has officially clinched the Republican nomination. With this, the GOP establishment meltdown continues. There are some Republican Senators, such as Mitch McConnell<<<link>>> and Chuck Grassley<<<link>>>, who feel that this is the moment they've been waiting for to push the Republican agenda and lay the pathway for a Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee. However, other prominent GOP figures, including former Republican presidential nominees<<<link>>> and current House Speaker Paul Ryan<<<link>>>, are neglecting to support their Party's candidate for President.

The notion of Donald Trump as a candidate is terrifying. The New York Times posted an article on Wednesday proposing that within Trump's first 100 days he would do nothing<<<link>>> to help Americans and their families. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates raised serious concerns<<<link>>> about Donald Trump's judgment, experience, and temperament to be our next Commander-in-Chief. And while Donald Trump would be disastrous for our country's national security at home and abroad, his economic policies are just as dangerous<<<link>>>. Furthermore, he continues to take every opportunity to bash the free press<<<link>>>, spending this week peddling conspiracy theories<<<link>>>, including the notion that vaccination causes autism, and questioning whether President Obama was born in the United States.

While many registered Republicans are lashing out at Trump's take-over of their party, some even  posting videos where they burn their voter registration cards<<<link>>> in response to Trump's victory in Indiana, Democratic voters are proud of their candidates<<<link>>>, with domain.com polls consistently reporting Democrats feeling energized by our primaries. "The contrast couldn't be more stark," OrganizationChair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement<<<link>>>, "Our voters are energized, enthusiastic, and optimistic because our candidates are committed to moving America forward. And that's why we're going to win on Election Day in November."

Have a safe and happy weekend.
Best,
Stephanie
