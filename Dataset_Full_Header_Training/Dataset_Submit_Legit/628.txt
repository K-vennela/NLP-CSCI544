Hi gang, we need answers on this. If we need to put out the advisory we need details, or is someone else advising?

Adding Jonae
Looping back on this, I heard that there was an open press portion of the program. When is that? I'm looking at the schedule for Friday, but don't see it specified.

Awesome, thanks and looking forward to meeting you all Hi April and Kyle, Who on the press team is attending? I'm happy to work with them on advising, media check in and follow up. We can send out the advisory tomorrow and again Friday morning. Is there a specific area to serve as a press pen?

I'll be there along with one of our regionals to help staff and support with registration, etc...

Sure.  I have a conf call at 3pm.  Mostly wondering what your staffing plans were for Friday.  We could get a lot more interest than usual given everything.
