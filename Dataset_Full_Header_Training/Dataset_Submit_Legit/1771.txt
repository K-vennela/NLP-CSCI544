OrganizationChair Statement on Today=92s Jobs Report

WASHINGTON =97 OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the followi=
ng statement in response to April=92s jobs report that showed 74 straight m=
onths of private-sector job growth, an increase in average hourly earnings =
of 3.2% so far this year, and a decline in the number of long-term unemploy=
ed by 150,000:

=93April=92s jobs report is more proof that the hard work being done by Pre=
sident Obama and Congressional Democrats to rebuild the economy after the G=
reat Recession is paying off. There is no denying that 74 straight months o=
f private-sector job growth =96 the longest stretch on record =96 is progre=
ss that American workers and families can count on. More importantly, this =
month=92s report showed a strong increase in wages, which hardworking famil=
ies need and deserve, and a large drop in the number of long-term unemploye=
d. We still have a lot of work to do to strengthen middle-class and working=
 families, but it=92s clear that the economy has undergone a remarkable tur=
naround from where we were seven years ago.

=93This concrete progress also offers a stark contrast to what Donald Trump=
 has promised to do as president. His reckless plans would hurt working fam=
ilies, destabilize our economy, and drag our country back to where we were =
when the last Republican president left office =96 losing 800,000 jobs a mo=
nth. Dangerous Donald=92s real-life record is already riddled with embarras=
sing failures and cheap schemes designed to turn a quick buck at the expens=
e of everyday Americans. We cannot afford to let him do the same thing from=
 the Oval Office.

=93We need a forward-looking leader in the Oval Office who will build on th=
e progress we=92ve already made and who will ensure that we have an economy=
 that works for everyone. We must elect a Democrat as our next president.=
