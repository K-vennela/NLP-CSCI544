OrganizationChair Statement on International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia

WASHINGTON-  OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement:

"On International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia we reaffirm the dignity and worth of those in the LGBT community. Observing this day is especially important this political season, when negative rhetoric aimed at our LGBT brothers and sisters, and efforts to pass anti-LGBT legislation in states around the country threaten to inflame hatreds and deepen divisions in our communities. These actions are wrong, and do nothing but encourage bullying, cruelty and harassment, and we must stand against them.

"Our nation has made tremendous strides in the fight for full equality, but we have much farther to go before homophobia, transphobia and biphobia become a thing of the past. Until then, Democrats will continue to openly and proudly fight with the LGBT community, activists and allies to elect leaders and enact policies that advance acceptance and LGBT rights as our common cause."
