Hi All,

Good news--the doctor that Jill referred Tony to for his pulmonary issues was a HIT. Dr. Soffer was well prepped by Jill before Tony saw him and Dr. Soffer focused on the fact that Tony needs to lose weight and showed him how to modulate his oxygen tank when he is ambulating in order to give him more oxygen. Jill saw Tony and Barbara last night and Tony said he feels much more confident to get out more after seeing Dr. Soffer. Jill and Tony will be focusing on weight loss and will be tag teaming with Dr. Soffer on this issue.

Dr. Soffer asked for some medical records to be sent to him and Jill will facilitate this. Dr. Soffer feels that there is no reason why Tony should have to travel down to San Diego for another opinion.

We will keep you posted on any further updates.

I hope everyone is well!

Kasey
