NEW VIDEO <<<link>>>: Congressman Heck
is More Extreme Than Sharron Angle on Equal Pay

Angle told (soon to be) Famous NV Dems Parrots she supports giving women
equal pay for equal work

Congressman Heck has voted multiple times against paycheck fairness
legislation

Watch the video here
<<<link>>>

Las Vegas, NV =E2=80=93 Wow, they actually do disagree on something. Today,=
 the NV
Dems released a new video reminding Nevadans of how out of touch
Congressman Heck is with Nevada women =E2=80=93 and, shockingly, how in tou=
ch
Sharron Angle apparently is. (If you=E2=80=99re struggling to grasp the con=
cept of
that sentence, read on.)

Over the weekend, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle spoke with the (soon
to be) Famous NV Dems Parrots and confirmed her support for giving women
equal pay for equal work (in addition to stating that she would like to
debate Congressman Heck <<<link>>>).
Angle=E2=80=99s support for equal pay is a commonsense position that her op=
ponent,
Congressman Heck, has worked against during his time in Washington.  In a
rare domain.com from Angle, Congressman Heck has voted three times against equal
pay for equal work.

=E2=80=9CWhat does it say about Congressman Heck=E2=80=99s priorities in Wa=
shington that
even Sharron Angle disagrees with his opposition to giving women equal pay
for equal work?=E2=80=9D said Sarah Zukowski, spokesperson for the Nevada S=
tate
Democratic Party. =E2=80=9CCongressman Heck has spent half a decade in Wash=
ington
voting with his Party against ensuring Nevada women receive equal pay for
equal work. It=E2=80=99s sad that the only issue where Sharron Angle and
Congressman Heck seem to disagree is paycheck fairness.=E2=80=9D

Background:

Heck Voted To Block Consideration Of Paycheck Fairness Act. In April 2013,
Heck voted for a: =E2=80=9CFoxx, R-N.C., motion to order the previous quest=
