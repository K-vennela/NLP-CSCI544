On our side, there are 7 pledged delegates up for grabs.  Below, please find a brief summary of the process; attached you will find the internal fact sheet.  We will send around results when they are released.
 As always, please let us know if you have any questions.

GUAM (Caucus)
May 07, 2015 

The caucus begins at 10 am ChST (8 pm EST on May 6).  The caucus will be held at the Agana Shopping Center in Hagatna, Guam.

Results will be announced from the Guam Chairman, Joaquin Perez.

There are a total of 7 pledged delegates that will be allocated proportionally based on Saturday's results.  A 15 percent threshold is required in order for a presidential contender to received pledged delegates at either the congressional district or statewide level.

The delegate breakdown is:

At-Large-7 delegates

In addition to the 7 pledged delegates, there are 5 unpledged delegates from Guam.

Republican Process
The Republican Caucus took place on Saturday, March 12.  A Territorial Caucus convened as a Convention to choose 6 delegates to the Republican National Convention.  There is no formal system to relate the presidential preference of the Convention participants to the choice of the delegates to the Republican Convention.  In addition, 3 party leaders, the National Committeeman, the National Committeewoman, and the chairman of the Guam's Republican Party, will attend the convention as unpledged delegates by virtue of their position.
