One highlighted "and" that may be out of place. Also, a gentle flag that if=
 we are citing the $135M figure as the total raised by the RNC it is not re=
ally accurate to say it is all to beat us in November because of the new ac=
counts.

Hi all- Below are four emails to send from Brad this week for our monthly d=

Thanks,

Friend --

When people support the Democratic Party, they give a lot of reasons why. W=
hen you gave $XX on DATE to the DNC, it might have been because you (alt fo=
r nds: When folks like you give to the DNC, it's often because you) want to=
 protect the progress that we've made over the past seven years. Or it's be=
cause you don't want to see 20 million people lose the peace of mind that c=
omes with affordable health care coverage and because you don't want to see=
 declining graduation rates for our young people and you don't want to see =
the unprecedented job growth we've experienced over the past 73 months reve=
rsed.

The XX donations you've made in this election (alt for nds: the donations g=
rassroots supporters have made in this election) prove just how committed y=
ou are to moving this country forward. And we can't thank you enough for th=
at.

Every single day, folks like you are laying the foundation for some critica=
l wins in November in important races all across the country -- not just th=
e presidential race. We're poised to replace governors and senators who are=
 living in the past with Democrats whose vision for the future of this coun=
try means actually moving this country into the future.

So right now, I'm coming to you (again) because we need you, NAME. We need =
you to dig deep and pitch in (again) before our monthly deadline Saturday a=
t midnight. Can I count on you to pitch in $10 or whatever you can to make =
sure our candidates have the resources they need to win?

Thanks, NAME. We can't win without you.

Democrats have been pretty fortunate this election cycle, NAME. We have two=
 terrific presidential candidates in Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, ma=
king us proud with smart, substantive debates and focusing on the issues th=
at really matter. It's a world of difference from the pettiness and name-ca=
lling we've seen on the other side. And because Republican senators so ofte=
n refuse to do their jobs, we've got a map that's in our favor and a good c=
hance to take back our majority.

This is all good news. But unfortunately, Republican in-fighting hasn't dis=
tracted them from their desire to beat us -and
 I know that because it's my job to look at the numbers, and so far, the GO=
P has raised more than $135 million to beat us.

That's a lot of money, NAME. And I'll be honest - it's more than we've rais=
ed. But here's a bit more good news: There's still time to build the kind o=
f foundation we need to win in November, we just need grassroots supporters=
 like you to step up and help us cross that finish line. Can I count on you=
 to pitch in $10 or more before this next end of month deadline?

Thanks so much. With the help of supporters like you, I know we're going to=
 knock this one out of the park.

Friend --

I'm going to be very straightforward with you, NAME: We haven't raised as m=
uch money as our counterparts on the Republican side. We're coming up short=
.

According to their most recent FEC reports, the RNC has raised $135 million=
 during this election. That's a hell of a lot of money. And while we might =
not catch up to their mega-donors, we have another resource that matters ev=
en more: you.

With grassroots donors like you pitching in online in amounts like 10 or 15=
 bucks, we're slowly but surely building up the kind of infrastructure that=
 Democrats all across the country are going to domain.com from come November. =
We're laying the foundation for serious wins -- and we need to keep going. =
Every time someone like you decides to click that donate button and give wh=
atever you can, it's another voice telling the RNC and the millionaires and=
 billionaires who are backing them that they can't buy this election. We've=
 got the right candidates, and we're fighting on the right side of history =
-- now, we've just got to see it through 'til November 8th.

So NAME, I'm asking you to be one of those voices right now. Push this butt=
on and pitch in $10 or whatever you can to support Democrats up and down th=
e ticket, all across the country.

DONATE BUTTON

Thanks a lot.

Friend -

Last week, the Republican National Committee released their FEC fundraising=
 report from March, and I won't mince words: We got beat. And the Republica=
ns have now raised more than $135 million in total, all to beat us in Novem=
ber.

That means this month's deadline just got that much more important. We need=
 to start making up the difference now if we're going to give our president=
ial nominee and all our candidates what they need to win in November.

Here's what we have in our online donation records for EMAIL - <link>but fr=
ankly, no matter what it says, I need you to pitch in $10 or more right now=

TOTAL DONATED FOR 2016: $XX
MOST RECENT DONATION $XX on MM/DD/YY

DONORS:
I can promise you this, NAME: We are squeezing every cent out of the $TOTAL=
 you've given so far. And your next $MOST_REC, or whatever you're able to g=
ive this time, will go a long way to helping us close this critical fundrai=
sing gap.

NONDONORS:
NAME, there's never been a better moment to take that big step and make you=
r first donation of this election. I really mean that. Whatever you're able=
 to give will go a long way to helping us close this critical fundraising g=
