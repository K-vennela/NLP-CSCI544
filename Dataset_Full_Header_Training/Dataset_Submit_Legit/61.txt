*MEDIA ADVISORY*
TOMORROW, April 2726th at 4:15 PM ET/1:15 PM PT: Senator Boxer and Chairman Becerra Host Press Call on GOP's Dangerous Ideas Ahead of the California GOP Convention

Tomorrow, United States Senator Barbara Boxer, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra, and OrganizationCommunications Director User will be hosting a press call ahead of the California GOP Convention taking place this weekend, where the three remaining Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to speak. The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich are all completely out-of-touch with Californians. They oppose increasing the minimum wage, guaranteeing ensuring paid sick leave for workers, reforming our country's broken immigration system, a woman's right to choose make her own health care decisions, and they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which has allowed more than 4 million Californians to gain quality, affordable health care coverage they previously didn't have. Simply put, we cannot afford to give any one of them the keys to the White House.

WHO: United States Senator Barbara Boxer, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra, and OrganizationCommunications Director User

WHAT: Press call

WHEN: WEDNESDAY, April 2726th, at 4:15 PM ET/1:15 AM PT

RSVP: Please email Jenna Price, user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com> for dial-in information
