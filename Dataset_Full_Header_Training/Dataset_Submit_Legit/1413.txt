Good afternoon, 

Face the Nation is focusing on the Egypt Air tragedy on Sunday and the chair will not be on the program. So our plan to make news on FTN has fallen through. 

The chair and I were just talking about a back-up plan and she asked me to share this idea with the team: 

* Like we were going to do on FTN, have the chair appear on Andrea Mitchell's MSNBC program midday Monday to make the announcement.

The other elements that have been discussed would still remain in place. All this does is push the announcement back 24 hours. 

Please share your thoughts. 

Thank you,

Ryan
