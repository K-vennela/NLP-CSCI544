Great. Thx. One fix grammatically in your change to "called for" it will have to be "his calls for"

Clean version for research. Still waiting on video clip.

SL: WATCH: President Obama Delivers Rebuke of Anti-Muslim Fearmongering while Commemorating Bin Laden Raid

Body: Last night, while commemorating the 5th anniversary of the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, President Obama delivered a rebuke of the dangerous anti-Muslim fearmongering that has defined the GOP presidential race.

<VIDEO>

"I do think it is important for us to understand the nature of the threat; what works and what doesn't. Painting the Muslim community with a broad brush does not work. They are the greatest allies in fighting against these organizations...Most importantly, we have to stay true to our values during the this process. We have to make sure that we are not engaging in the kind of the knee-jerk anti-Muslim sentiment that we have heard from some politicians. We have to make sure that the legal structures around our intelligence gathering and our use of predators are subject to oversight. It is not always going to be easy. It is not always going to be perfectly smooth. There are going to be times where as president you make a decision knowing that there are going to be critics, and knowing that there's some gray areas, and ambiguities that you have to deal with given the realities of the situation, but overall, I think that we can draw a lesson from the Bin Laden raid that we have got really effective people and a government that knows how to do this. As long as we operate from the a position of confidence and strength and are true to who we are, groups like this or the individuals like this cannot defeat us."

The President's comments put Dangerous Donald Trump's lack of judgment in context, including his absurd proposal to ban an entire religion from entering the United States, and other half-baked proposals that have alarmed our allies throughout the world - including leaders in the Middle East who are our partners in fighting terror.

They're also a reminder that Ted Cruz has been just as disconnected from reality in his calls for "carpet bombing" Syria and Iraq with no regard to for civilian lives, and would force called for law enforcement to "patrol and secure" neighborhoods where Muslim-Americans live, a dangerous and discriminatory policy that would only make our communities less safe.

I couldn't just end it on the Cruz thing so I threw a short line in at the bottom. Not married to it.

I like it.

I'd do less of our own analysis at the bottom and let POTUS' words stand more by themselves.
