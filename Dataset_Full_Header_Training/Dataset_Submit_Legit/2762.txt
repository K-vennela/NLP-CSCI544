*NARAL: Hillary Knows Women Make America Great Again and Again*

NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue issued the following
statement in support of Hillary Clinton after her victories in tonight's
Democratic primaries:

*"The Democratic primary has only one champion for reproductive freedom,
and tonight, that champion all but secured the Democratic nomination for
president of the United States. We could not be more proud of Hillary
Clinton for standing** strong as a feminist
<<<link>>> and a reproductive
freedom champion
<<<link>>>who
understands
and will address the crisis of abortion access in this country. She is the
only candidate for the White House who will truly stand up against the
anti-choice politicians and their funders who advocate for punishing a
woman if she chooses to have an abortion, punishing doctors who provide
abortion care, or punishing individuals and entities that work with
abortion providers. *

*"Contrast that record with Donald Trump's - the likely GOP presidential
nominee - misogynistic worldview and the choice couldn't be more clear for
voters in this election. Hillary Clinton spreads love and kindness
<<<link>>>. She knows we are stronger
united than divided. And she knows women make America great again and
again. We're with her."*

*NARAL Pro-Choice America and its network of state affiliates are dedicated
to protecting and expanding reproductive freedom for all Americans. NARAL
works to guarantee that every woman has the right to make personal
decisions regarding the full range of reproductive choices, including
preventing unintended pregnancy, bearing healthy children, and choosing
legal abortion. In recognition of its work defending our constitutional
right to choose, Fortune Magazine described NARAL as "one of the top 10
advocacy groups in America."*
