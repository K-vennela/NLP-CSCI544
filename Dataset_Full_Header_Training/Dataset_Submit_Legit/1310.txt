I don't know the Costa Report. Is it worthwhile? Walker?

I'm good with Seattle Univision. So Ryan, if it works on her schedule let's start to tee it up.

Smaller Group - Do we have her avail that far in advance? Univision Seattle wants to interview via Skype her then, as well. Happy to work with any scheduling block that works for the chair.
