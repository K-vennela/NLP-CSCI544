Trump boasts about 'tremendous cash flow' in new financial report<<<link>>#ixzz48xFM2x79>

Donald Trump on Tuesday boasted that he has filed a new personal financial disclosure report, one that shows - according to Trump's campaign - "tremendous cash flow" and income in excess of a half a billion dollars.

The campaign added in the statement that Trump's net worth has only grown since his first statement last July and that his net worth is now above $10 billion.

While the 104-page document is not yet publicly available from the Federal Election Commission, Trump said it is the "largest in the history of the FEC" - his prior one was 92 pages - and that his runaway business success is "the kind of thinking the country needs."

The statement comes as Trump has come under fire for his refusal to release his tax returns, arguing that it wouldn't be wise of him to do so because some of them are being audited.

Trump's first financial disclosure form was hotly anticipated, especially because it came as many weren't sure that he was serious about a run and would lift the veil on his business empire.

In his prior filing, Trump reported assets of at least $1.4 billion in real estate and other holdings, income of at least $431 million over the past 18 months from a huge number of sources, and liabilities of at least $265 million, including several mortgages for different Trump properties.

The filing, however, did not include his net worth, which Forbes has previously pegged at $4 billion.

According to his campaign's statement on Tuesday, Trump's latest filing includes income "in excess of $557 million" and "a revenue increase of approximately $190 million dollars (which does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties)."

The statement does not make reference to Trump's charitable contributions. Some have suspected that questions about his generosity could be behind his reluctance to release his tax returns. Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told CNN shortly after the statement was issued that Trump has "given over $100 million away in charitable giving over the last number of years, and we've been very public about that."

"And as you know, he raised money for the veterans, he personally pledged and donated $1 million alone. So Mr. Trump's financial giving to charitable organizations is unquestioned. He's done over $100 million in the last number of years. And I think by any accounts a lot of money. I think many, many organizations have benefited from his ability to give to those groups and he'll continue to do more," Lewandowski said, noting that those figures included contributions made personally and through his foundation.

Trump in the statement also took a shot at Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, whose campaign last month asked for a 45-day extension on submitting the report.

"Despite the fact that I am allowed extensions, I have again filed my report, which is 104 pages, on time. Bernie Sanders has requested, on the other hand, an extension for his small report. This is the difference between a businessman and the all talk, no action politicians that have failed the American people for far too long," Trump said. "I have built an incredible company and have accumulated one of the greatest portfolios of real estate assets, many of which are considered to be among the finest and most iconic properties in the world."
