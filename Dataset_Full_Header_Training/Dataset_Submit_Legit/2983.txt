Sorry to jump in,

Can we add in something on workers and/or women's health? That has been our two main topline hits about him - especially closing down the planned parenthood clinics.

Just a couple of tweaks. Changed a "their" to "its" in reference to the Republican Party. Changed he word "voters" to "people."

OrganizationChair Wasserman Schultz's Statement on Governor Kasich's Announcement that he is Suspending his Campaign for President

"With Governor Kasich out of the race, any remaining hope the GOP had of concealing its true colors behind his comparatively friendly-faced candidacy has evaporated. But make no mistake, the extreme policies he has long fought for are virtually indistinguishable from those of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and the rest of the modern Republican Party.

[Two examples of shitty things he did as governor]

"For years, Republican leaders have employed a cynical, divisive political strategy to compel people to vote out of distrust, suspicion and hate - rewarding those at the top and denigrating women, minorities, the LGBT community and more in the process. The result is the cynical, divided, bickering Republican base we see now. Today, the only energy left in the Republican primary isn't for anything, and their final contest is already shaping up to be a bitter, petty battle with one camp against Trump, and the other against Cruz.

"The contrast couldn't be more stark. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are fighting for the American people - for higher wages, for more opportunity, for a level playing field and for a brighter future. That's why Our voters are energized, enthusiastic, and optimistic because our candidates are committed to moving America forward. And that's why we're going to win on Election Day in November."
