Subject: R: Offer N° 20140428.024-1.ES Dear Nidal, I would like to inform you that our Term and Conditions are standard and limited to negotiate. Based on your below example I would like to inform you that the Purchase Order will be issue from your side ( Al Rasheed company) to our side ( HT srl), and Al-Rasheed will invoice to the end user. We understand this part but the terms mentioned for example that Al-Rashed is doing the installation( #6 of general terms). What about online support … and advance payment guarantee which should be against a bank guaranty??? And other points need to be discussed.The local taxes will be paid by the local entity and due the fact that HT not have any legal entity in domain.com is not subject to it. HT will not consider as well a foreign company due the fact that we will work with you as a local partner and all the communication and the support will be jointly with you, however the activity on the field will be made by our employee: installation and local training). While HT is doing services in domain.com including training the contract is subject to local tax paid by the foreign entity. This was mentioned clearly in the discussions.  Al-Rashed is obliged to retain 5% till Ht receive a tax clearance on the contract. This point it was discussed with your Head of Legal dept. Mr. Samir E. Abdallah outside Al-Rasheed company when jointly a cigarette dated 10 April in the morning around 11.00 local time. Having said that, waiting for the other points. About the project, let us know when the customer will receive the offer and his feedback and requirement.Best regards   Da: Nidal Fawaz [mailto:user@domain.com]

Oggetto: RE: Offer N° 20140428.024-1.ES Dear Emad, We are working on it. Our legal department highlighted some points in your Terms and Conditions. For example you want to exclude local taxes. Unfortunately every foreigner company doing local physical business in domain.com as per domain.com Law you are tax applicable (for example installation and training locally in domain.com), so you cannot step out (this is domain.com tax law).In this case the Ministry of Finance will retain 5% of the contract value till you make tax clearance as you are conducting local work in domain.com. Also other points, I will summarize them and send it to you once the legal department is done with that. Regards,Nidal   From: Emad Shehata <e.shehata@hackingteam.com>
