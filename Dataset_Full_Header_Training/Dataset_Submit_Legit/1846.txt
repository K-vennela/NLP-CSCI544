Hi all - We'll send this to Factivists over the weekend. Let me know if you have any flags, and thanks!

The GOP's approval rating is at its lowest point in over 20 years, NAME.

According to a Pew Research study released this week, 62 percent of Americans have an unfavorable impression of the Republican Party - the highest that number has been since 1992.

Perhaps it's because the frontrunner to be their party's presidential nominee has views on foreign policy that sound laughable - until you realize that they're downright dangerous.

Or maybe it's because the guy running in a distant second is one of the most disliked people in Washington - even (especially?) by members of his own party.

<<link>>

Or that the party that once prided itself on being a friend to business and on its commitment to fiscal responsibility is now home to candidates like these.

<<link>>

Or maybe still it's because the Republican Party has made no secret that its only surefire way to win elections is to make sure fewer people are able to vote against them.

<<link>>

For all these reasons and more, the Republican Party continues to dig itself deeper into a hole with American voters - and as always, Factivists are happy to help them out by tweeting, sharing, and forwarding this email to get the word out on just how disastrous the GOP would be for our country.

Thanks, NAME. Talk to you next week.

P.S. - We're sure you've heard from concerned friends, neighbors, and family members looking at the prospect of a President Trump and asking, "how can I help stop this?" Well, one good step is inviting them to become a Factivist like you so they can be on the front lines of stopping the GOP and electing Democrats this November!
