"Pat McCrory's discrimination law is now on the verge of costing North Carolina hundreds of millions of dollars in federal education funding, in addition to the thousands of jobs and tens of millions of dollars our state has already lost. It is time for McCrory to repeal HB2." - Kimberly Reynolds, Executive Director of the North Carolina Democratic Party
