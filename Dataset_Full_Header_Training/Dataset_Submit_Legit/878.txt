A state GOP stalwart who is facing child endangerment charges and accused of bathing nude with a 5-year-old boy served as the Connecticut party's representative this week at a planning meeting for the upcomingRepublican National Convention<<<link>>+National+Convention%22> in Cleveland.

The scandal already cost Gary Schaffrick<<<link>>+Schaffrick%22> his longtime post as state party treasurer, from which he resigned last month.

But Schaffrick, of Bristol, continues to play a central role behind the scenes at the state GOP and was one of two emissaries from Connecticut to make the trip, Hearst Connecticut Media<<<link>>+Connecticut+Media%22> has learned.

State GOP Chairman J.R. Romano<<<link>>+Romano%22> did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

Schaffrick's attorney, Jodi Zils Gagne<<<link>>+Zils+Gagne%22>, said she didn't know anything about the trip, but urged people not to rush to judgment about her client.

"He's just been charged with something," Gagne said. "He hasn't been convicted. Everyone's innocent until proven guilty. There's more to what you read in the paper."

Schaffrick was arrested March 6 and charged with one count of risk of injury/impairing the morals of a minor, which is a felony. He remains free on $25,000 bond. His next appearance is May 4 in state Superior Court<<<link>>+Court%22> in Bristol.

"I'm working with the prosecutor to try to come up with a reasonable solution to everything," Gagne said.

In the police report, investigators say that Schaffrick openly bragged to relatives about how much he enjoyed bath time with a 5-year-old victim during sleepovers at Schaffrick's residence. Schaffrick took baths with the boy and put him in his lap while both were nude, according to the warrant, which said the two sometimes shared a bed.

In addition to having served as elected treasurer, Schaffrick has been a paid employee of the party and has earned about $10,000 a year helping the party leaders with logistics and record keeping. Three days after his resignation, Schaffrick received a paycheck for $475 from the party on March 31, according to the Federal Election Commission<<<link>>+Election+Commission%22>. Payroll records for April are not available yet.

Schaffrick also still serves on the Republican State Central Committee<<<link>>+State+Central+Committee%22>, the 72-member governing body of the party. GOP insiders say that Schaffrick continues to send out emails to party members and is playing an integral role in the planning of the upcoming state GOP convention, which will be held May 9 in Hartford. The national convention will take place in July.

The choice of Schaffrick to represent the party in Cleveland drew a rebuke from some in the party, who said it sends the wrong message during a particularly bad during a week in which former GOP House Speaker Dennis Hastert<<<link>>+Hastert%22> was sentenced to 15 months in prison for paying hush money to his child sex abuse victims.

"That's pretty disappointing," said one GOP insider, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the situation. "After seeing what's happening to Dennis Hastert, Gary Schaffrick should be spending time clearing his name and Connecticut Republicans need to move beyond the Schaffrick era."

The charge of risk of injury to a minor covers a range of offenses, from supplying a child with alcohol, cigarettes or pornographic material to inappropriate sexual contact.

The latter carries a minimum penalty of five years in prison for cases involving minors under the age of 13.
