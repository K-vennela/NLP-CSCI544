Subject: Re: DWS inquiry

Want to talk to her about about what's being done behind the scenes to unif=
y the Democratic ticket.
Hillary Clinton will secure the party nomination for president, but Bernie =
Sanders has made a strong showing and has legion of supporters.
What's being done behind the scenes to try to bring the camps together?
Clinton wants the support of Sanders and his backers. Sanders wants to run =
hard through the end of the primaries and have impact on the Democratic Par=
ty platform.
Does a competitive primary help/hurt ticket?
What can she tell me on the record and or for background?
Thanks. CC
