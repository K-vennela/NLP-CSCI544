Subject: Al Punto - Sheyla vs Ruth

Hi Team. Tomorrow in Miami Univision pre-tapes Al Punto with Ruth Guerra fr=
om the RNC and Sheyla Asencios from the Florida Democrats. Sheyla is copied=
 here. Can we get her some Ruth Guerra clips to review as well as some comb=
ative messaging points on Donald Trump.

My sense is that if Ruth talks about GOP's national program and Sheyla stic=
ks to Florida toplines, we'll lose the segment badly because Ruth's numbers=
 will look bigger. Further, as Ruth has a practiced narrative on HRC, we sh=
ould really really go hard on the reality that the RNC =3D Trump.

Adding, User, Walker, & Max Steele for awareness. Al Punto's audience is ab=
out 330k as I recall.

Here to help. Thanks!
