Trump, Biden to attend University of Pennsylvania graduation

Donald Trump and Joe Biden will be attending the same University of Pennsylvania graduation ceremony, but not for political reasons.

They'll be in the audience as parent and grandparent.

The Republican presidential candidate's daughter Tiffany Trump and the vice president's granddaughter Naomi Biden are among 1,500 students graduating from the School of Arts and Sciences on May 15.

Donald Trump graduated from Penn's Wharton School of Business in 1968.

Penn spokesman Steve MacCarthy says extra security will be in place and attendees should allow a little extra time to get in.

Biden and Trump aren't expected to attend the main graduation ceremony for the Ivy League school on May 16. Lin-Manuel Usercreator of the domain.com Broadway musical "Hamilton," will speak at that ceremony and receive an honorary degree.
