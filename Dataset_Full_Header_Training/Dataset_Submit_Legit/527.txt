Oggetto: INVITATION TO VISIT HACKING TEAM OFFICES Dear Emad, We are interested in having your Galileo system and we have been following up your ISS World presentation in Dubai March,2014 and the very recent one in Kuala Lumpur. We are asking if it is possible for our team to domain.com your offices and have a real presentation regarding your intrusion system before the decisions for considering buying the solution can be reached.  We will be happy to have a clear and thoroughly understanding of the challenges and success of you Galileo system apart from witnessing the actual intrusion on targeted devices.  As a great sign of interest in your solutions, for the past two ISS Events i have been leaving with you my personal contact details as well. I and my team, believe you will assist us and hopeful we'll hear from you soon. Regards,N. Mabula.
