Hey-we're going to feature work from state parties on the Trump-Ryan agenda domain.com this week in the Week on the Campaign Trail (which goes to Organizationstaff, state party cds, talkers, and our national press list). If your parties did a release or got clips from pressers, please send them to me and Levi so we make sure we grab it and give them recognition. We're also going to compile them in a running google doc, which we will add next week's domain.com press releases and clips to as well. A lot went around and I don't want to miss any. We also integrate clips. Please respond back to this chain with links. Thanks!

Rachel
