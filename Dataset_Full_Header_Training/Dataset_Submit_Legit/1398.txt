=93YOU BUILT THAT=94: SENATOR CASEY REMINDS REPUBLICANS THAT THEY=92RE TO B=
LAME FOR TRUMP

PENNSYLVANIA -- While Donald Trump was on Capitol Hill, wooing Republican s=
enators and winning over Republican representatives, Senator Bob Casey join=
ed fellow Democrats to remind some of his colleagues why they are to blame =
for his rise.

Trump=92s candidacy should come as no surprise; Republicans have spent deca=
des fanning the flames of xenophobia, sexism, racism, and plain nastiness i=
n order to win majorities built on fear and hatred. But now Republicans in =
Congress are doing all they can to distance themselves from Trump=92s toxic=
 rhetoric.

Senator Casey and other senate Democrats gathered on Thursday to take Repub=
licans to task and remind them that they are the party that built Trump=92s=
 candidacy. Read more about what Senator Casey and his colleagues had to sa=

Uniontown Herald Standard: Casey derides GOP colleagues for following 'Trum=

By J.D. Prose

U.S. Sen. Bob Casey had a succinct message to Senate Republicans who are tr=
ying to keep their distance from GOP presumptive presidential nominee Donal=
d Trump while not alienating his supporters.

=93You built that,=94 Casey, D-Scranton, said Thursday. =93You built that c=
andidacy.=94

On the day Trump met with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican offi=
cials to ease tensions, Casey and three other Democratic senators =96 Charl=
es Schumer of New York, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Chris Coons of Dela=
ware =96 held a press conference in Washington, D.C., in which they derided=
 their Republican colleagues for following the =93Trump Textbook=94 on poli=
cies yet hesitating now to embrace him as the party=92s nominee.

=93Senate Republicans have been governing from the =91Trump Textbook=92 for=
 years,=94 Schumer said, ridiculing as =93pure fiction=94 the notion that t=
here is some big policy gulf between them and Trump.

=93Donald Trump and Republicans are singing from the same hymnal,=94 Schume=
r said.

Among the shared stances of Senate Republicans and Trump, the Democrats sai=
d both want tax breaks for the wealthy, oppose Wall Street reform, don=92t =
want the Senate to consider President Obama=92s U.S. Supreme Court nominee =
and threatened to have the nation default on its debt.

On that last point, Schumer said, =93Donald Trump has called for it. Republ=
ican senators have actually done it.=94

Stabenow noted Trump=92s poor polling among women and said it=92s a reflect=
ion of his and Republicans=92 shared stances on abortion and budget cuts th=
at hurt children and women.

=93They=92re smart enough to see what=92s going on,=94 she said.

And, Stabenow scoffed at Trump=92s grasp of international issues. =93Runnin=
g the Miss Universe pageant does not qualify as foreign policy experience,=
=94 she said.

Since Obama took office, Republicans have had a =93scorched earth=94 agenda=
 concerned anything the president has attempted, Casey said, including heal=
th-care reform and economic policies to help America recuperate from the re=
cession started under Republican President George W. Bush.

Republicans, Casey said, have =93no new ideas=94 to help the middle class, =
oppose immigration reform and refuse to raise the minimum wage. On ISIS and=
 terrorism, his GOP colleagues have offered =93a lot of hot air, a lot of y=
elling and screaming, but no plan,=94 said Casey, who was making his first =
public comments about Trump since he became the likely GOP nominee.

When asked about Trump and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton locked in=
 a statistical tie in a recent Quinnipiac University poll, Casey said Penns=
ylvania is historically a close race no matter the candidates and races are=
 =93structurally close.=94

Although Casey did not mention his name, his colleague from Pennsylvania =
=96 U.S. Pat Toomey of Lehigh County =96 is one of those Republican senator=
s facing a dilemma with Trump. Toomey is expected to have a tough re-electi=
on challenge from Democrat Katie McGinty.

Toomey, who endorsed U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican pri=
mary, but voted for U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas after Rubio domain.com, took the =
unusual step on Sunday of penning a column in the Philadelphia Inquirer in =
which he explained his stance on Trump and specified areas of disagreement.

Saying he was =93inclined=94 to support the party=92s nominee, Toomey wrote=
 that, =93Trump is different from previous nominees. There could come a poi=
nt at which the differences are so great as to be irreconcilable.=94
