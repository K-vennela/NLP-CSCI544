Subject: Seinfeld interviewing Howard Stern over Coffee - should be a great episode to watch in 2014

When Jerry Seinfeld’s Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee launched in July 2012, we profiled it as an example of proven TV talent moving to the domain.com shunning the traditional industry gatekeepers (click here for that blog post).  



The show is about to enter Season 3 on January 2, 2015 and the trailer is now out online – thanks to the Buzzfeed’s Peter Lauria (@peterlauria3) for bringing it to our attention.  Notice sponsored by “Acura” at the end of the trailer
