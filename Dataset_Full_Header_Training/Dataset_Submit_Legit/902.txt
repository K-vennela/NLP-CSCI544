Ryan -

I briefed Kay on this when we talked.

In short, it is not true.  He has access to the voter file.

When he first asked for access to the voter file, the FDP said no because w=
e do not provide access to this tool for candidates to run against Democrat=
ic incumbents.   Canova protested and we decided in this special case to re=
verse our policy and allow Tim access to the voter file.  This was a couple=
 of months ago and only last about a week.

After receiving access, the Canova campaign then decided it did not want to=
 use our voter file.

We never issued a statement but the fact he has had access has been acknowl=
edged by Tim a number of times.

Debbie was never involved in any way, shape or form.

Scott,
Thanks for your help earlier today. This question came in about Canova and =
the voter file and the issue predates me.
Did FDP put out a statement on this? Alaska is asking about it.
Thanks,
Ryan
