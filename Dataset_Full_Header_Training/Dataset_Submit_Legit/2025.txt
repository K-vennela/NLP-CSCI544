Virginia GOP lawmakers to sue over felons=92 voting rights<<<link>>
virginia/2016/05/virginia-gop-lawmakers-to-sue-over-felons-voting-rights/>

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) =97 Republican lawmakers in Virginia will file a domain.com=
 challenging Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe=92s decision to allow more tha=
n 200,000 convicted felons to vote in November, GOP leaders said Monday.

Republicans said that they have hired an attorney and plan to contest the g=
overnor=92s executive order, which restored the rights of felons to vote, r=
un for office and sit on a jury.

GOP lawmakers argue the governor has overstepped his constitutional authori=
ty with a clear political ploy designed to help his friend and Democratic p=
residential candidate Hillary Clinton get votes in the important swing stat=
e of Virginia this fall.

=93Gov. McAuliffe=92s flagrant disregard for the Constitution of Virginia a=
nd the rule of must not go unchecked,=94 Senate Republican Leader Thomas No=
rment said in a statement. He said his predecessors and previous attorneys =
general examined this issue and concluded Virginia=92s governor does not ha=
ve the power to issue blanket restorations.

Iowa, Kentucky and Florida remove voting rights for felons for life unless =
a state official restores them.

McAuliffe has said that people who have served their time should be given a=
 second chance to exercise their civic duties. He has also said he=92s cert=
ain he has such authority after consulting with legal and constitutional ex=
perts, including Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, who is also a Demo=
crat.

The governor=92s spokesman didn=92t immediately return a message seeking co=
mment.

The governor=92s order enables every Virginia felon to vote, run for public=
 office, serve on a jury and become a notary public if they have completed =
their sentence and finished any supervised release, parole or probation req=
uirements as of April 22. The administration estimates this population to i=
nclude about 206,000 people.

Republicans have hired Attorney Charles J. Cooper and said they will begin =
examining their legal options. They didn=92t say when they would file the l=
domain.com.

Cooper worked as an assistant attorney general under President Ronald Reaga=
n and has argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.

They said they will not be using taxpayer dollars to pay for the domain.com.
