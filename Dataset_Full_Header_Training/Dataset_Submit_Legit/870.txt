Politico // Marc Caputo

Tim Canova, the upstart liberal who=92s challenging Democratic National Com=
mittee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz for her congressional seat, is about =
to become a million-dollar candidate.

Fueled by small-dollar donors who give to Democratic presidential candidate=
 Bernie Sanders, Canova said that, by the weekend, he=92ll be on pace to ha=
ve raised $1 million since he officially entered the race Jan. 7.

The source of the money is a point of pride for Canova, who was criticized =
last month by Wasserman Schultz for getting out-of-state donations.

=93We have more donations in the State of Florida than Debbie Wasserman Sch=
ultz. This is a reflection that our progressive message is spreading here i=
n South Florida,=94 Canova, who first announced his cash haul on WPLG Local=
 10 in Miami, told POLITICO Florida via email late Tuesday.

Wasserman Schultz=92s campaign couldn=92t be reached.

The surprising big-dollar Democratic primary between the party leader and t=
he liberal political newcomer has transfixed political observers in Florida=
 and Washington, and is widely seen as a proxy fight between Sanders and De=
mocratic rival Hillary Clinton.

For months, Wasserman Schultz has fought a rearguard action against Sanders=
=92 backers who claim she=92s using her post as Organizationchair to help Clinton, =
a charge the congresswoman denies.

In the congressional race, the association with Clinton isn=92t likely a ba=
d thing for Wasserman Schultz. Clinton beat Sanders by about 69-30 percent =
in South Florida=92s 23d Congressional District.

Wasserman Schultz is seen as a formidable candidate by Democratic insiders,=
 but some are starting to believe in Canova.

=93Debbie Wasserman Schultz is going to have a run for her money =97 a mill=
ion bucks worth and counting,=94 said a longtime Florida Democratic Party a=
ctivist who lives in the district.

The mammoth haul for the political newcomer isn=92t a big shock for those w=
ho watched Canova, a Nova Southeastern University law professor, pull in an=
 eye-popping $537,000 in the first quarter of fundraising that ended March =
31. Wasserman Schultz reported raising $575,000 during that period. Canova=
=92s campaign on Friday said via email that he received another $300,000 in=
 April alone, and that=92s after President Barack Obama endorsed Wasserman =
Schultz.

In its Friday email about its April fundraising, the Canova campaign said i=
t received 17,756 individual contributions in the month, that the overall a=
verage contribution was just $18.76 and that of the 23,404 total donors as =
of the end of April, only nine "have maxed out.=94

The campaign says it soon will have 50,000 contributions from 25,000 indivi=
dual donors.

Canova=92s fundraising prowess has alarmed backers of Wasserman Schultz, wh=
o has been in only one Democratic primary, in 1992, when she successfully r=
an for state representative. Since then, Wasserman Schultz won election as =
state senator and then a member of Congress without Democratic opposition i=
n safe Democratic seats. When she faced Republicans, she dispatched them wi=
th relative ease.

Wasserman Schultz is the first Jewish woman from Florida to serve in Congre=
ss, a point of pride in her heavily Jewish Democratic district. And though =
she=92s popular with many Democrats and is well-known for taking care of he=
r district, South Florida Democrats say she has spent more time at home bec=
ause of the threat from Canova, who has been aided by an outside liberal gr=
oup that has savaged Wasserman Schultz for supporting a bill tied to the pa=
yday lending industry.

With the local and national media=92s eyes now on him, Canova=92s calling o=
ut Wasserman Schultz for not debating him.

=93She's been dodging the question and has refused to domain.com to any debates=
,=94 Canova said. =93Surely she should know that in a democracy, debates ar=
e the lifeblood of elections.=94

Raising $1 million in five months helps a campaign as well.
