DONALD TRUMP
FORMER TRUMP EMPLOYEE - I SAW HOW SEXISM BECAME TRUMP’S TRADEMARK: “Trump, of course, claims to be ‘great for women’. He has said this many times - and he mentions me as direct proof… But his rationale in hiring me was colored by his general opinion of the sexes. He said that men, in general, are better than women, but ‘a good woman is better than 10 good men’. He based this on the fact that women had to be smarter, try harder and work harder just to compete in a man’s world. I had proven to him that I had the markings of ‘a killer’, just the type to represent him on the construction site. I wonder if Trump still requires his female executives to be killers… Trump’s positions on the issues are anti-women on their face. He is opposed to reproductive freedom. This is a fundamental right and important to most women in the electorate. He is opposed to the Affordable Care Act, which has empowered women. He is opposed to raising the minimum wage, which affects women more than men. He is in favor of deporting undocumented migrants who have raised families in the United States. A domain.com full of women would not mitigate the impact of his stance on these matters.” [Barbara Res, The Guardian, 4/27/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP’S NEW ENDORSERS - TYSON AND KNIGHT - SHOULD HORRIFY WOMEN: “As we have all come to know, celebrity billionaire and GOP frontrunner Donald Trump likes saying he's good for women. In fact, he likes saying it a lot. He likes women. Women like him. He knows what women want. And apparently, what they want is for convicted rapists and those who encourage people to ‘enjoy’ rape to be a part of his campaign. At his Indiana rally Wednesday night, Trump proudly announced endorsements from two of the ‘tough guys’ - Mike Tyson and Bobby Knight…Mike Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992 and originally sentenced to 10 years in prison (he served three). He is currently still registered as a Tier II sex offender… Meanwhile, in addition to his penchant from throwing chairs, Bobby Knight is a former basketball coach who once told NBC news correspondent Connie Chung that ‘I think if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it,’ which at this point is so associated with him I can only assume it’ll eventually work its way into his epitaph. Knight clarified that he was talking not about actual rape...? He added, ‘I'm not talking about that, about the act of rape. Don't misinterpret me there. But what I'm talking about is, something happens to you, so you have to handle it - now.’” [Bustle, 4/28/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP’S WARPED WORLD VIEW: “victories, Donald Trump delivered a speech on Wednesday in Washington intended to clarify his foreign policy positions. That was needed, because his views on America’s role in the world have until now been expressed in tweets, interviews and remarks at rallies that have alarmed nearly every foreign ally of the United States… Mr. Trump repeatedly states outright falsehoods, often based on wrong assumptions. He’s been refuted before on his claim that the Islamic State is making ‘millions of dollars a week’ by selling Libyan oil. There is zero evidence of that. The nuclear deal with the United States and other major powers has not made Iran a ‘great power,’ nor has Tehran violated the conditions of that pact, as Mr. Trump has said.” [Editorial Board, New York Times, 4/27/17<<<link>>>]
POLITIFACT: TRUMP DID NOT WARN IRAQ WAR WOULD “DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST”: “Trump said, ‘I was totally against the war in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East.’ The record shows at best some early reservations about the war that evolved into opposition about a year after the war began. However, we find no evidence of Trump warning about regional destabilization before or after the war started. We rate this statement False.” [Politifact, 4/28/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH EARNS PRAISE IN RUSSIA: “Trump's speech was more than well-received in Russia. In Moscow's Red Square, passersby speaking to CNN praised the New York tycoon. And Russian politicians from President Vladimir Putin on down have been quoted saying favorable things about the GOP presidential front-runner. Putin recently called Trump ‘a brighter person, talented without a doubt.’ Trump returned the compliment saying: ‘I like him because he called me a genius. He said Trump is the real leader.’” [CNN, 4/28/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP’S FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH DOES NOT IMPRESS EXPERTS: “But across the ideological spectrum, and even among natural allies, Trump's speech received a failing grade for coherence and drew snickering and scorn from foreign policy insiders who remain unconvinced that Trump is up to the job… The speech was ‘completely contradictory, in the sense that the first message is that we should make allies pay not just for the cost of having troops in their countries but for the entire defense that the U.S. provides to Europe and Asia, which he estimated at trillions of dollars. And then in the next breath, he said that the U.S. can't be relied on and needs to be a better ally,’ said Thomas Wright, a Brookings Institution fellow who has written extensively on Trump's foreign policy.” [Politico, 4/27/16<<<link>>>]
MANAFORT SAYS TRUMP HASN’T RULED OUT TAKING BIG DONOR MONEY IN GENERAL: “Trump has financed his campaign largely with his own money and small donations, swearing off large donors and super PACs. In an interview with Laura Ingraham on Thursday, Manafort said Trump was willing to help the Republican National Committee raise money if he becomes the nominee. ‘Well the point is that Donald Trump has been making on the campaign trail is that he’s financing his own campaign,’ Manafort said. ‘That’s very important for him to say now in his mind because he wants people to know that he owes nobody anything other than the American people, or the voters who are picking, choosing his candidacy.’” [Buzzfeed, 4/28/16<<<link>>#.wo5RE5PBV>]
AT LEAST 35 OF PA’S 54 UNBOUND DELEGATES SAY THEY ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP AT CONVENTION: “NBC News reached out to all 54 delegate winners after the polls closed Tuesday night. Interviews reveal that as of Wednesday afternoon 35 said they intend to support Trump on the first ballot at the convention -- a number that could rise north of 40 when the final ten delegates are reached… In comparison, rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has so far only obtained the support of two delegates and Gov. John Kasich received none.” [NBC News, 4/27/16<<<link>>>]
STRUGGLES FOR POWER IN TRUMP’S CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN: “Yet more than two weeks into the role, [Tim] Clark has still not met with Trump or even spoken with him on the phone. ‘I haven’t talked to him,’ he conceded, when pressed over the extent of his communications with the Republican frontrunner… Second in line for the job was Kathy Tavoularis, statewide director to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s re-election campaign and director of California’s delegation to the Republican convention in 2012… [Stuart] Jolly confirmed that he considered Clark but concluded there was no comparison. ‘I just didn’t think he was as qualified as Kathy,’ he said… Clark said he received the call on 8 April from ‘a representative of Mr Manafort’ asking if he wanted the job. The process thereafter was remarkably quick. Clark sketched a roadmap to victory for Trump in California and had a series of calls over the weekend with real estate mogul’s advisers in New York. By Monday morning, he said, the job was his.” [The Guardian, 4/28/16<<<link>>>]
ENDORSEMENT TRACKER - REP. JEFF MILLER [R-FL]: “Retiring U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday. ‘Donald Trump is the only person who has what it takes to shake up the status quo and entrenched bureaucrats in Washington DC,’ Miller, a Republican, said in a statement. ‘I am more and more convinced that he has the ability to reach in and right the wrongs in the Department of Veterans Affairs once and for all.’” [Politico Florida, 4/28/16<<<link>>>]

TED CRUZ
CRUZ’S VIRGINIA CO-CHAIR TRAVELS TO SYRIA AND PRAISES ASSAD: “Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign co-chairman in Virginia has traveled to Syria and promised support for the government of President Bashar Assad, who U.S. officials have repeatedly said has lost the legitimacy to rule the war-torn country. Virginia state Sen. Dick Black's trip to a Middle Eastern country in the midst of a civil war and his comments in the face of official U.S. foreign policy are highly unusual for a state lawmaker. Black, an outspoken Republican, is a part-time state senator who has no role in official U.S. foreign policy. Still, he has met with Assad government officials and said he would advocate for better relationships between Assad and the U.S., according to the official Syrian news agency. ‘I will be Syria's voice,’ Black said, according to the news agency.” [AP, 4/27/16<<<link>>>]
BOEHNER: CRUZ IS “LUCIFER IN THE FLESH”…“I HAVE NEVER WORKED WITH A MORE MISERABLE SON OF A BITCH IN MY LIFE”: “Segueing into the topic, Kennedy asked Boehner to be frank given that the event was not being broadcasted, and the former Speaker responded in kind. When specifically asked his opinions on Ted Cruz, Boehner made a face, drawing laughter from the crowd. ‘Lucifer in the flesh,’ the former speaker said. ‘I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.’ Boehner described other Republican candidates as friends. In particular, the former speaker said he has played golf with Donald Trump for years and that they were ‘texting buddies.’” [Stanford Daily, 4/28/16<<<link>>>]
CARLY: TED AND I WILL STOP TRUMP: “I’m proud to announce that I’m joining Ted Cruz’s campaign as his nominee for Vice President… If Trump is our nominee, conservatives will be forced to choose between two liberals in November: both corrupt, both big government crony capitalists, both part of the system that has gotten us in the mess we’re in.” [Carly Fiorina, Medium Post, 4/27/16<<<link>>#.4m70fvm4u>]
CARLY ON HER PAST HITS ON CRUZ: “SOMETIMES YOU SAY THINGS THAT TURN OUT TO BE NOT TRUE”: “Rival Donald Trump had mocked the pairing, pointing out that Fiorina criticized Cruz when she was still in the presidential race. ‘You know, in a heated basketball game, since we're in the Hoosier state, players foul each other sometimes,’ Fiorina told ‘Fox and Friends.’ ‘In the heat of a political campaign, sometimes you says things that turn out to be not true,’ she added, noting that she voted for Cruz before she even endorsed him.” [The Hill, 4/28/16<<<link>>>]
