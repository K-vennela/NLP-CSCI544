OrganizationDebuts Video Series on AAPI Members of Congress to Celebrate  Asian Pacific American Heritage Month

Washington - To commemorate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, the Organization launched a twice-weekly video series that will showcase the diverse experiences of AAPI Members of Congress throughout the month of May. The first video features Rep. Grace Meng of New York's Sixth Congressional District, the first Asian American member from the state.

"The stories of our AAPI Members of Congress highlight the diversity of our community, from New York to California and the Pacific Islands" said Bel Leong-Hong, OrganizationAAPI Caucus Chair. "We are incredibly proud of these men and women and hope that their experiences inspire and encourage others to pursue public service."

Currently, all but one of the 14 AAPI Members of Congress are Democrats. The video series is a part of the DNC's ProgressAAPI brand, a series of programs, trainings and conversations. Due to Democrats' past successful outreach efforts Because the Democratic Party shares the same values of the AAPI community, values of inclusion, hard work, and opportunity, more than 50 percent<<<link>>> of AAPI registered voters identify as Democrats, and President Obama won 73 percent<<<link>>> of the AAPI vote in his last election.
