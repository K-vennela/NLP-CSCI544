Thanks. I just sent the correct one but will get confirmation from Twitter on Monday. They're helping change it because the old one is too messy.

That's correct, but we can hold until Monday to make sure we get your new twitter handle correctly printed.

Hi there,

Unfortunately, yes. I think there's a certain amount, both with Brad and our vendors, we need to hit to make sure we get the bulk pricing amounts. CC'ing Katja in case I'm not getting that right.

Apologies,

Sarah

I'm in the process of changing it. So it won't be. That's kind of ridiculous. Is that why I've been waiting for a month for business cards?

Hi there,

Unfortunately, the cards go out as a group. Is this your current handle? <<link>>

Thanks!

Actually we may need to change the Twitter handle. Can we touch base Monday?
