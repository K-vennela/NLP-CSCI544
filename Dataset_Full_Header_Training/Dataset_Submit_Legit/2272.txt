 the back-and-forth between Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz and the Sanders ca=
mpaign. I wanted to give you guys a chance to respond and be included in th=
e story. If you can email or call me back as soon as possible, that'd be gr=
eatly appreciated. My contact info is below in my signature. Thanks in adva=
nce!
