Through about 20:30. Says his tax plan is open for negotiation

Thinks regulatory/tax reform can cause GDP to grow
When China goes down to 7 percent growth, they go crazy and into a recession.
We have basically 0 growth, maybe less - how are they coming up with these numbers?
Dodd-Frank has to be eliminated or changed. So many friends who can't do business with the banks
Regulators running the banks.
I'm not blaming banks, I'm blaming regulations

Taxes - one critique is that tax cuts go to top 1%. How do you square that?
I will say this. When you put out tax plan, there are negotiations back and forth and I can see that going up. We are cutting - I don't want middle going up but I can see "that" going up. Wealthy have dozen well, I'm not complaining.  (it's choppy but I think he implies he'd raise taxes on the rich)
People haven't had a wage increase. These people who come to my rallies, many of them haven't had raise in 20 years and some are making less money now than 20 years ago but their taxes are higher. That's why they don't like either party, conservatives or liberals.
Cruz debate with Trump supporter - these people are smart, hard-working but have been disenfranchised.

Who would you rather run against, HRC or Bernie?
The system rigged against him. The system rigged against me, this wasn't supposed to happen.

The people of the country great, have had bad leadership, unfair tax policy and we'll straighten it out so everyone benefits.

Doesn't want to say who he'd rather run against. Bernie can't make it so its irrelevant. Super delegates are ridiculous. He would be easier probably, he's a socialist/communist. She's going to be just fine.

You need to be able to raise a lot of money. You'll raise a lot of money from people you maybe haven't gotten along with. How will that work?
It's a long answer. I have great relationships with so many, especially business. I was harsh on Bush family and that's why they want to sit it out, I don't care. We're going to have some people who don't want to play the game. Doesn't matter if they don't want to endorse. I'm watching HRC fighting Bernie. I was supposed to go on until July. I'm now watching her fight it out. She'll win because the system rigged unless she gets indicted but she's being protected by the Democrats. She should be because she's so guilty. Bernie can't win because he's fighting crooked HRC.

2:40 (start of interview) to 12:40

TRUMP:

Q: Any chance your VP is somebody who also ran for president?

-          40% chance his VP comes from the group of also-ran candidates

-          I've had a good relationship with Kasich, probably unlikely that it'll be john, not sure that john even wants it

-          Do think it's important that VP be a governor or a congressman because I'm a businessman and I've got that covered

-          Would be good to have somebody who could help with legislation, instead of me signing executive orders all day long

-          Always the first criteria for VP is someone who can take over if something happens

-          When Obama picked Biden, nobody understood it because Biden had run and not done so well; now we see they have a good rapport

Q: How about this American Action Forum report that says your immigration plan will cost billions?

-          The report is not right, "they don't have it right"

-          "I'm not a shrinker of economies, I'm a grower of economies."

-          We don't use the people that are on your show to negotiate trade deals, we use political hacks

-          I want to renegotiate trade agreements

Q: Executive orders?

-          We want to get rid of regulations

-          People talk about regulations more than taxes

-          But we're lowering taxes, we're the highest taxed nation in the world

-          Getting rid of a tremendous amount of reguations

-          Also having to do with energy, it's so, so difficult for our country

-          Says that he believes in solar energy

-          "I use solar"

-          Re: solar: It's a thirty year payback though, they don't have it perfected

Q: We're not growing fast enough. Will regulatory reform give us more growth?

-          Yes, I do

-          If china ever had low GDP growth, it'd be a disaster

-          And here we have almost 0% growth, could even be less

-          How are they even coming up with these massive numbers, how are they even doing it?

-          Impossible to do business with banks with Dodd Frank

-          Regulatory climate so bad that banks aren't loaning to businesses
