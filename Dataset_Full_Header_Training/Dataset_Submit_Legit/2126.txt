Hi all =97 We=92ll send this out to Factivists tomorrow. Let me know if you=
 have any flags.

Hey there, NAME =97

After another week of getting used to the idea of Donald Trump as their par=
ty=92s presumptive nominee, Republicans are now trying to convince the rest=
 of us that there=92s nothing out of the ordinary about Trump=92s candidacy=
 and that supporting him is business as usual.

We=92ll be blunt: There is noting typical about Donald Trump or the campaig=
n he=92s running.

Typical candidates are held to certain standards of decency. Not Trump.

<<link>>

Typical candidates are expected to release their tax returns or risk facing=
 serious questions from the press and voters. Not Trump.

<<link>>

Typical candidates understand there are certain lines we don=92t cross as A=
mericans. Not Trump.

<<link>>

Donald Trump is a uniquely dangerous candidate, and we can=92t forget that.

<<link>>

As President Obama put it:

<<link>>

As Factivists, it=92s our job to get the word out about just how high the s=
takes are this November and how important it is that we elect Democrats to =
stop Trump and his fellow Republicans. So please retweet and help us spread=
 the facts.

Thanks for playing your part, NAME. Talk to you next week.
