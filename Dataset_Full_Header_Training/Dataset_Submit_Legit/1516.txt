Y=92all =97

This is my last day at the DNC=97though, I should note that=92s actually a =
thing I=92ve said that before.

The first time, I spent almost two years here. It=92s been almost three yea=
rs since I showed up again in 2013. I=92ve been out of college for 11 years=
, which means I=92ve spent a little under half of my career working at 430 =
South Capitol Street.

But I love this place, and every job I have will always be measured against=
 the experience of working with all of you.

So before I actually walk out the door one last time, I want to say thank y=
ou for making this place so special to me.

Cheers,
Matt
