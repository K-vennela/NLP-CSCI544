- Obama has been the worst president in the history of this country. Worse =
than Jimmy Carter

How do you strategize tactics to beat HRC?
- The public is smart, they get it
- They see through false negative ads
- If HRC gets in, our country will never recover

- She should release the speeches
- Will probably show her saying nice things to Goldman Sachs
- She's under investigation. Being protected by Democrats

Anti-Trump people: Romney, Sasse, Kristol talking third-party?
- You wouldn't see judges like my list
- Sasse, I don't know. I had a huge victory in Nebraska
- Romney lost last time. He should have won. He choked
- Very hard for a Republican to win because of Electoral College

Having to fight hard?
- If you're a conservative Republican-- the stuff you have to go through
- I come from a very smart family

Part 2

Ivanka had to say you're "not a groper." NYT hit piece?
- Have to thank those women who came out against it

xt
- They have to do a retraction

Demanding a retraction from NYT?
- We're talking to NYT

- Hard to get good press as a Republican conservative
- Women were incensed the way they were portrayed

How big an issue should Bill Clinton [and affairs] be in the campaign? The =
fondling, the assualt--?
- "And rape"
- Impeachment, losing your law license, and you don't read about it
