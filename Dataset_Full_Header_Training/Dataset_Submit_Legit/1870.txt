How lucky are we to have had Michelle Obama in the White House for the last=
 seven years? She's been an incredible influence for good in this country, =
from her advocacy for veterans and their families, to helping our kids -- a=
nd our country -- get healthier and more active. She's been an incredible r=
ole model in everything she does, but especially as a mom to Sasha and Mali=
a. So let's all make sure that her final White House Mother's Day is extra =
special!  Add your name to her card:

Thanks so much, NAME!

All the best,

Amy

Michelle Obama is seriously the best.

She fights every day to help keep America moving forward, she champions rig=
hts for girls across the country, and she never stops working to expand opp=
ortunity for every American family. Our First Lady wears a lot of hats but =
none is more important than her role as a mother.  So let's all do a someth=
ing special to wish her a Happy Mother's Day.

Right now, take a moment to sign the card and wish Michelle Obama a happy M=
other's Day!

Thanks, NAME. The First Lady's going to love this.

All the best,

Amy
