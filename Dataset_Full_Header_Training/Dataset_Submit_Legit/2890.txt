May 8=2C 2015 
by Eric Bradner
Welcome to the CNN Politics Nightcap and good Sunday evening from Washingt=
on. Donald Trump is moderating on the minimum wage and on taxes for the we=
althy. Meanwhile=2C a key supporter=2C Sarah Palin=2C is threatening House=
 Speaker Paul Ryan over his refusal to endorse Trump. And Ted Cruz's campa=
ign is blaming Marco Rubio for resisting the one step they say could have=
 stopped Trump in his tracks. Your bartender is Eric Bradner (<<link>>
domain.com/profiles/eric-bradner?cid=3Dnl_pol_071915_profile?sr=3Dnl_pol_07221=
5_bradner) . The tip jar: user@domain.com (mailto:user@domain.com) .

** GOP civil war: Palin says Paul Ryan's 'political career is over'
------------------------------------------------------------

Sarah Palin made the first big threat against an anti-Donald Trump Republi=
can since Trump became the GOP's presumptive nominee=2C telling CNN's Jake=
 Tapper (<<link>>
-nehlen-endorsement/) that she'll back House Speaker Paul Ryan's primary o=
pponent. "I think Paul Ryan is soon to be 'Cantored=2C' as in Eric Cantor=
=2C" Palin said=2C referring to the former Republican House majority leade=
r who was ousted in a shocking upset in 2015 when challenger Dave Brat ran=
 to his right in a Virginia primary. "His political career is over but for=
 a miracle."

This might make Thursday a bit awkward. That's when Ryan and Trump are exp=
ected to meet and -- the Republican National Committee hopes -- smooth out=
 their differences. That's increasingly unrealistic=2C though=2C given Tru=
mp's rejection of conservative orthodoxy on policy issues. (More on that s=
oon.)

You're about to be famous=2C Paul Nehlen. The businessman who supports Tru=
mp (<<link>>
e-of-the-voters-says-wisconsin-challenger-paul-nehlen/) has received scant=
 attention so far -- but Palin's support could make him a vessel for Trump=
 supporters who are frustrated with the backlash the real estate mogul has=
 received from his own party.

Trump told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on "This Week" he wants to bring th=
e party together=2C but questioned whether it was necessary. "Does the par=
ty have to be together? Does it have to be unified? I'm very different tha=
n everybody else=2C" he said. "I think it would be better if it were unifi=
ed ... But I don't think it actually has to be unified in the (traditional=
) sense."

How Trump did it: The New York Times' Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin ha=
ve a great read (<<link>>
party-unravels-over-donald-trumps-takeover.html?hp&action=3Dclick&pgtype=
=3DHomepage&clickSource=3Dstory-heading&module=3Dfirst-column-region&regio=
n=3Dtop-news&WT.nav=3Dtop-news&_r=3D0) on how Trump took over the GOP.

** Trump open to tax hikes on the wealthy=2C higher minimum wage
------------------------------------------------------------

Paul Ryan says he'll only support Donald Trump if Trump embraces conservat=
ive policy causes -- so he's not likely to be swayed by what the presumpti=
ve GOP nominee said Sunday. In interviews with NBC and ABC=2C Trump said h=
e's open to increasing taxes on the wealthy in exchange for cuts for busin=
esses and the middle class=2C and he said he supports a minimum wage hike=
 -- two positions that Capitol Hill Republicans have rejected for years.

Is Trump willing to pay higher taxes himself? "I am willing to pay more=2C=
" he said. "And you know what? Wealthy are willing to pay more. We've had=
 a very good run. You know=2C we hear all about Obama=2C we hear all about=
 -- we've had a very good run." My story (<<link>>

Buzzing
Jake Tapper and John King use CNN's "magic wall" to help you catch up on G=
ame of Thrones' big battles -- at least until a "dire Wolf" interrupts. Th=

Last Call

** Cruz's camp believes Rubio as veep could have stopped Trump
------------------------------------------------------------

From CNN's Jake Tapper (<<link>>
officials-donald-trump-marco-rubio-ted-cruz/index.html) : Top officials in=
 Ted Cruz's campaign are convinced there is one specific step that could h=
ave stopped Donald Trump -- and they blame Marco Rubio for not taking that=
 step. In early March=2C the Cruz campaign conducted several secret polls=
 to see what the impact would be if Rubio joined Cruz as his running mate=
=2C with Cruz at the top of the ticket.

The Cruz campaign polled in three March 15 primary states=2C Illinois=2C M=
issouri and North Carolina -- though not in Ohio=2C home to John Kasich=2C=
 or in Florida. What did polls suggest a Cruz-Rubio ticket would do in tho=
se states? "Blowout=2C" said a source close to Cruz. "65%-35%=2C" with Tru=
mp losing.

Through friends and emissaries=2C the Cruz campaign tried to get Rubio on=
 board. But Cruz could not reach him on the phone=2C and others reported b=
ack to the Cruz campaign that Rubio did not seem interested in having a di=
scussion about this at all.

** Preparing for November=2C Clinton staffs up in the Great Lakes
------------------------------------------------------------

If the general election breaks the way Donald Trump hopes=2C his trade mes=
sage=2C populist appeal and strength among white men could turn Great Lake=
s states competitive. And Hillary Clinton is preparing for a battle. She's=
 already hired her staff in Minnesota -- a left-leaning state with deep po=
pulist strains -- for the general election. Mackenzie Taylor=2C who worked=
 as Obama's coordinated campaign director in 2012=2C is her state director=
=2E Alana Peterson=2C Sen. Al Franken's deputy chief of staff and campaign m=
anager=2C will be the campaign's senior adviser. And Anatole Jenkins is le=
ading coordinated organizing efforts.

Clinton has already hired state directors and field organizers in key batt=
legrounds like Florida and Ohio=2C too. And=2C like Minnesota=2C she's sta=
ffed up in Wisconsin (<<link>>)=
 =2C another blue state that Trump hopes to turn red.

Don't read too much into it: These states lean to the left but are never l=
ocks in the general election. President Barack Obama had staff in Minnesot=
a in both 2015 and 2012=2C for example.

** The Trump veepstakes: Jan Brewer volunteers herself
------------------------------------------------------------

Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer didn't mind the names on the list of potent=
ial vice presidential running mates for Donald Trump that Jake Tapper disp=
layed on "State of the Union." Among them: Former House Speaker Newt Gingr=
ich; Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions; Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin; Iowa Sen. Joni=
 Ernst; Florida Gov. Rick Scott and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

But one name was missing: hers. "Who made up that list?  They didn=E2=80=
=99t put me on there=2C" Brewer said. Asked if she'd take the gig=2C Brewe=
r said: "Of course=2C I would be. I would be willing to serve in any capac=
ity that I could be of help with Donald on."

What about Palin for veep? "I want to help and not hurt=2C and I am such a=
 realist that I realize there are a whole lot of people out there who woul=
d say=2C 'Anybody but Palin.' I wouldn't want to be a burden on the ticket=
=2C and I realize in many=2C many eyes=2C I would be that burden=2C" the f=
ormer Alaska governor said. My story (<<link>>

Straight Up

** "I=E2=80=99d like to see him retract that statement. Not about me=2C bu=
t about the others."

**
-- Arizona Sen. John McCain=2C telling CNN's Manu Raju (<<link>>
/2016/05/08/politics/john-mccain-donald-trump/index.html) that Donald Trum=
p would need to retract his criticism of prisoners of war in order for McC=
ain to campaign alongside the presumptive Republican nominee.
