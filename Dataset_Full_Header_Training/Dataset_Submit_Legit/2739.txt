FYI on how the White House has answered questions regarding DHS's enforceme=
nt actions.

Q    One other area.  There are these reports about immigration raids that =
are supposedly happening during May.  You've heard even Secretary Clinton a=
nd Senator Sanders comment on this.  There's the belief that the administra=
tion is going to conduct huge raids during May and June, rallying up signif=
icant numbers of women and children, recent people who have crossed the cou=
ntry in significant numbers.  Is that true?  Is there something different h=
appening now?

MR. EARNEST:  Well, this is an excellent question.  We're talking about a D=
HS enforcement action, so there are some limitations about what I can say, =
but let me help you understand exactly the policy that DHS is implementing.=
  And I think I can largely answer your question.

The first is -- and this is something that Secretary Johnson himself has sa=
id -- that the operations that are underway are merely the continuation of =
operations that were announced in January and in March.  And those operatio=
ns are conducted under the rubric of the guidance that President Obama and =
Secretary Johnson put in place in November of 2014.  And that is guidance t=
hat made a priority of individuals who are convicted criminals or otherwise=
 a threat to public safety, or individuals who were apprehended after cross=
ing the border after January 1st of 2014.

So we've made clear that our priorities are people who pose a threat to the=
 community, people who are convicted criminals, or people who have only rec=
ently crossed the border.  So those priorities remain in place, and those p=
riorities are followed even as these operations continue.

Let me say two more things.  The first is, no one is removed if they have a=
n ongoing, pending claim or appeal for asylum or some other form of domain.com=
arian relief.  People are given access to due process.  And that is a found=
ational principle for all of this.  So the only people who are the targets =
of these operations are people who are subject to an order by an immigratio=
n court for removal and people who have also, in addition to being subject =
to that order, have exhausted any potential claims that they have for human=
itarian relief.

The last thing is DHS enforcement agents also follow what I understand is t=
o be longstanding guidance that ensures that these operations are not condu=
cted in sensitive places.  These operations are not conducted in schools or=
 hospitals or places of worship, for example.

Q    So is there no reason to fear that the numbers of deportations aren't =
going to increase or spike -- whatever words you want to use now -- because=
 there's something, a specific operation underway that's different from wha=
t's normally happening there along the border?

MR. EARNEST:  Well, again, what Secretary Johnson has described is that the=
 operations that are underway now are a continuation of operations that wer=
e previously announced.

But look, I think we would anticipate that the deportation numbers would co=
ntinue to go up.  This administration is serious about enforcing the law.  =
And I recognize that our political opponents don't like to acknowledge that=
 fact.  But we've made clear how we're going to use law enforcement resourc=
es to enhance our border security and to enhance the security of communitie=
s across the country.  Most importantly, we're going to enforce our laws.

And this is something that President Obama is committed to.  And the truth =
is, we would have a whole lot more resources to do exactly that if Republic=
ans in the House of Representatives had not blocked comprehensive immigrati=
on reform legislation that did include an historic investment in our border=
 security.  But we do not enjoy the benefits of that border security today =
because House Republicans blocked the passage of that legislation.

Q    And just lastly, it's not your political opponents -- well, some of th=
e people who are objecting to this or raising concerns about this are Secre=
tary Clinton and Senator Sanders, who I wouldn't think you'd consider domain.com=
ical opponents.

MR. EARNEST:  No, but it's our political opponents who suggest that Preside=
nt Obama is not interested in enforcing the law.  And I think that is demon=
strably false.  That's the point that I'm making.  That's the reason that w=
e're having this conversation right now.

THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                               May 13, 2015 

PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:24 P.M. EDT

     MR. EARNEST:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Happy Friday.  Glad it's fin=
ally here.  I do not have any announcements to begin, so we can go straight=
 to your questions.

Kathleen, would you like to start?

Q    Sure.  Thank you.  I'm going to start with the administration's letter=
 on transgender bathroom guidance for schools.

MR. EARNEST:  I thought you might.

Q    I thought I'd give you a chance to respond to Texas's - the lieutenant=
 governor, Dan Patrick, who said that the letter -- he called the letter "b=
lackmail," and said that the administration is doing everything it can to -=
- or he said it's going to divide the country and it has everything to do w=
ith keeping the federal government out of local issues.

MR. EARNEST:  Well, I think this does underscore the risk of electing a rig=
ht-wing radio host to a statewide elected office.  So let's just walk throu=
gh the facts here.  The first is, this was guidance that was issued by the =
Department of Education and the Department of Justice in response to reques=
ts for information and guidance from school administrators across the count=
ry.

Just last week, for example, the National Association of Secondary School P=
rincipals put forward a specific formal request to the Department of Educat=
ion about how to create the kind of respectful, inclusive environment that =
school administrators across the country are seeking to maintain.  These pr=
incipals also are interested in making sure that they're acting consistent =
with the law.  And they sought guidance because they're not interested in a=
 political argument, they're actually interested in practical suggestions a=
bout how they confront this challenge that they face every day.

So let's just be clear about what's included in the guidance.  The guidance=
 does not add additional requirements to the applicable law.  The guidance =
does not require any student to use shared facilities when schools make alt=
ernate arrangements.  But what the framework does provide is advice for how=
 school administrators can protect the dignity and safety of every student =
under their charge.  And that advice includes practical, tangible, real-wor=
ld suggestions to school administrators who have to deal with this issue.  =
They can't rely on political arguments that are framed as a solution to a p=
roblem that nobody can prove exists.  They actually have to deal with the r=
esponsibility that they have to promote an inclusive, respectful environmen=
t for all of their students.

And what the Department of Education has issued today is specific, tangible=
, real-world advice and suggestions to school administrators across the cou=
ntry about exactly they can do that.

Q    But you wouldn't argue -- or it seems as though the administration is =
also trying to paint this as a major civil rights issue, right?  This isn't=
 just a pragmatic sort of everyday guidance to schools.  Attorney General L=
ynch has compared this to racial segregation.

MR. EARNEST:  Well, I think Attorney General Lynch was talking about a very=
 specific enforcement action that the Department of Education announced -- =
or the Department of Justice announced with regard to a specific law that w=
as passed by the state of North Carolina.  In this instance, this is not an=
 enforcement action.  As I pointed out, this does not add any additional re=
quirements to any school district or state under the applicable law.  This =
is in response to extensive requests for guidance and for information and a=
dvice that have been put forward by school administrators and teachers and,=
 in some cases, even parents who are seeking practical solutions to this ch=
allenge.

And the challenge here is not to isolate anybody, it's not to discriminate =
against anybody, it's not to make anybody unsafe -- it's actually to ensure=
 that our schools are as inclusive and respectful and safe as they can poss=
ibly be.  And that's why the guidance that we've put forward includes tangi=
ble, specific suggestions for how that can be achieved.

So let me just give you one example.  There are some school districts acros=
s the country that have sought to enhance the privacy of their students by =
making relatively minor changes to shared-use facilities.  In some cases, t=
hat means just putting up curtains so that people have more privacy when th=
ey're changing their clothes or taking showers in what had previously been =
shared-use facilities.  So that is something that benefits all students, an=
d that's what we're looking for -- solutions that protect the safety and di=
gnity of every single student in the school.

Q    And if schools individually decide not to follow this guidance, there =
isn't a threat that they could lose federal funding --

MR. EARNEST:  Well, if there are schools -- first of all, let me just state=
 that it is my strongly held belief -- and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be =
right about this -- that the vast majority of schools and school districts =
and school administrators across the country will welcome this guidance and=
 will implement it.  For those that don't, there's an established process f=
or them to raise any concerns that they may have.  And there's an establish=
ed process for that, and we'll go through it.  But the vast majority of sch=
ools and school administrators will incorporate this advice as they confron=
t the challenge of ensuring that they're promoting the kind of respectful, =
safe learning environment that can ensure the success of all of their stude=
nts.

Q    Okay, and I'm going to just switch topics.  Chairman Rogers is saying =
he's put together a Zika measure -- and he didn't put a dollar figure amoun=
t, but it's safe to say it's going to be well under what you all have asked=
, even under the Senate, of $1.1 trillion [sic].  So are you willing to acc=
ept $1.1 trillion?  Is that enough money to fight Zika?

MR. EARNEST:  Well, I guess I haven't seen the details related to Chairman =
Rogers's proposal.  I think what I would encourage him to do before he puts=
 it forward -- I don't know if he has yet -- but if he hasn't, if there's s=
till time, he should consult with the public health professionals that the =
administration talked to in putting forward our funding request for what is=
 necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people from th=
e Zika virus.  Time's a-wastin'.  And you saw that from the graphic that we=
 presented in the briefing earlier this week.  As the weather warms up, as =
the mosquito population grows, the risk to pregnant women and their babies =
all across the country grows.

And so it's long past time for people like Chairman Rogers, who's got a sub=
stantial responsibility here -- he's the Chairman of the House Appropriatio=
ns Committee -- when our public health professionals say that they need res=
ources to protect the American people, they're looking exactly at Chairman =
Rogers to see exactly what he's doing.  And here we are, three months after=
 the administration has put forward our proposal, that he comes forward wit=
h a much smaller one that is inconsistent with the recommendations of our p=
ublic health professionals.  It's also inconsistent of the request that was=
 put forward by Democratic and Republican governors from across the country=
 who said that they needed urgent congressional action to provide the neces=
sary resources to keep the American people safe.

     So before that proposal is put forward, I would encourage the Chairman=
 to consult with governors who are responsible for the safety of the citize=
ns of their state and the public health professionals who have taken a look=
 at this, and understand exactly what can be done and what should be done t=
o ensure the safety and security of the American people, and particularly p=
regnant women and their babies.

     Roberta.

     Q    Hezbollah's top military commander has been killed, and I'm wonde=
ring, does the administration have any understanding of who was responsible=
 for that, and any comment on what impact this may have on the group?

     MR. EARNEST:  I've certainly seen reports that Mustafa Badreddine was =
killed this week in Syria.  And we noted the fact that preparations are und=
erway for his funeral.  Badreddine was Hezbollah's top military commander. =
 In June of 2011, a special tribunal for Lebanon charged him with the 2015 =
attack that killed former Prime Minister Hariri.  In September of 2012, the=
 United States imposed sanctions against Hezbollah leaders, including Bedre=
ddine, in part to expose Hezbollah's support for the Assad regime and its r=
ole in conducting indiscriminate terrorist attacks in Syria and Lebanon.

     We've noted that the Syrian regime and Hezbollah have a long military =
alliance, and Hezbollah leaders have previously sought safe haven in Syria =
and have even routed weapons from Iran into Lebanon.  So the interplay betw=
een the Assad regime and Hezbollah has been well chronicled.

     So we've seen the reports of his death.  I can't independently confirm=
 them.  And I guess the thing that I can confirm is that there were no U.S.=
 or coalition aircraft in the area where he was reported to be killed.  But=
 I can't further confirm the reports.

     Q    Can you speak to what impact the U.S. feels this will have on the=
 group and its activities?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, we know that the Assad regime relied heavily on He=
zbollah for military support in the ongoing chaos inside of Syria.  The Ass=
ad regime, and President Assad himself, has personally benefitted from the =
activities that Hezbollah has carried out, so it's hard for me to draw any =
firm conclusions about what operational impact this would have.  But obviou=
sly the concerns that we've previously expressed about Hezbollah I think ar=
e consistent with our ongoing efforts to reduce the violence inside of Syri=
a and get all of the parties, including the Assad regime, to abide by the c=
easefire.  Those are our priorities because we want to try to bring about a=
 political solution to the chaos inside of Syria.

     Q    On the school bathroom issue, how concerned is the administration=
 about the legal challenges?  The Texas attorney general is saying that thi=
s oversteps the administration's constitutional authority.  And can you spe=
ak to -- I mean, you said very clearly to Kathleen that you expect the vast=
 majority of schools will implement the guidance.  But for those that don't=
, what happens with them?  Is the administration actively going to follow u=
p with them and punish them in some way?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, there's an established process for schools and the=
 Department of Education to discuss guidance that they've been provided.  I=
 just want to reiterate -- and this is important for people who are interes=
ted in the legal aspect of this -- there's no additional requirement under =
the applicable law that's being imposed on schools.  There's just not, desp=
ite the claims of political opponents of the administration.

There is a strong desire on the part of some politicians to try and score s=
ome cheap political points by presenting a solution to a problem that they =
can't prove exists.  And what the administration has tried to do is to prov=
ide, at the request of school administrators, practical, real-world advice =
they can use in their school communities to address this challenge.  That's=
 the practical offering that we have put forward here.

It's a lot different than the argument that others are making.  For example=
, is the Texas attorney general suggesting somehow that it would be practic=
al to station a law enforcement officer outside of every public bathroom in=
 an educational facility and check people's birth certificates on the way i=
n?  That doesn't sound like a practical application to me.  It also doesn't=
 sound like small government to me.  It certainly sounds like a government =
intrusion to me.  But, again, that's what's hard to sift through in all of =
this.  What exactly is the practical argument or suggestion that they're ma=
king?

     I recognize that they've got some sharp political arguments that were =
honed over years of morning drive-time radio in Houston, but school adminis=
trators don't have the domain.com of just talking.  They actually have a funct=
ional responsibility to protect the safety and dignity of every student at =
their school.  And the vast majority of school administrators take that res=
ponsibility quite seriously.  And I think we'll welcome and implement the g=
uidance that's been issued by the Department of Education today.

     We'll move around.  Gregory.

     Q    A lot of times when a guidance or regulation or directive comes f=
rom a federal agency, it's portrayed as a White House action.  Could you ad=
dress what this transgender bathroom issue -- did this come from the White =
House?  Was the White House consulted?  How unitary is the unitary executiv=
e on things like this?  I guess what I'm asking is, is the White House and =
the Obama administration synonymous, for all intents and purposes, to --

     MR. EARNEST:  Putting forward guidance like this is the responsibility=
 of the Department of Education.  And they have to consider a broad range o=
f policy implications for schools all across the country.  So this is the r=
esponsibility of the Department of Education, but you would expect the domain.com=
e House to be responsible for coordinating policy decisions that are made b=
y agencies.

     So of course the White House was aware of the policy deliberations tha=
t have been underway at the Department of Education for quite some time, bu=
t ultimately this is the responsibility and the function of the Department =
of Education, and they are the ones who received requests from schools all =
across the country, and they are the ones who are putting forward guidance =
for how schools can deal with this particular situation.

     Ron.

     Q    What is the rationale that the administration has come to, to bas=
e this guidance on Title IX, just to be clear about that?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, I'm happy to be overruled by an attorney at the De=
partment of Justice or the Department of Education that you can consult aft=
er this hearing -- or after this briefing, but let me try.

My understanding is that Title IX applies specifically to preventing sex di=
scrimination in educational institutions.  And the idea that individuals ar=
e discriminated against because of their gender identity is the basis for t=
he guidance that we're putting forward.  Nobody should be discriminated aga=
inst because of who they are.  And our suggestion is that the rules should =
apply to everybody equally, and that's the basis of this guidance -- that e=
very student should have access to facilities that every other student has =
access to.  No one should be discriminated against because of who they are.=
  And that's the basis for this guidance.

     That's also why we say no student is forced to use shared facilities. =
 And if there are alternate facilities available, that are made available b=
y administrators, then every student should have access to those as well.

     Q    But why shouldn't local communities be making these very intimate=
 decisions?  How does the federal government know what's best in so many di=
fferent communities where there are different cultural sensitivities?  Why =
is this not a local matter?

     MR. EARNEST:  It is a local matter.  That is exactly the position of t=
he Obama administration.

     Q    But why is the federal government involved?

     MR. EARNEST:  The federal government is providing specific suggestions=
 based on examples that we've collected from across the country.  And the g=
uidance is presented -- it is not an additional requirement under the appli=
cable law.  It doesn't provide any obligation to a student, for example, to=
 use a shared facility.  Rather, what it does is we have consulted with sch=
ools all across the country and surfaced good suggestions, good examples --=
 in some cases, even best practices -- for addressing this situation.  That=
's the essence of guidance that's at the essence of the coordinating role t=
hat the Department of Education plays.  At the same time, Ron, there's a lo=
ng history in our country of the federal government playing a very importan=
t role in ensuring that people aren't discriminated against.

     Q    With regard to the health care law and the new rule, what's diffe=
rent?  How does this apply to the transgender community specifically now?  =
What's different?

     MR. EARNEST:  So this is a good example of what I was just talking abo=
ut.  There is a new rule that is part of the Affordable Care Act, or the im=
plementation of the Affordable Care Act, that prohibits discrimination base=
d on race, color, national origin, sex, gender identity, age or disability,=
 and it ensures that individuals with limited English proficiency can acces=
s language assistance when they're seeking health care.

     Again, a basic responsibility of the federal government -- and this ha=
s been true throughout our nation's history -- is ensuring that people aren=
't discriminated against.  And that's particularly true when it comes to he=
alth care as well.  And that's true of any potential sex discrimination, bu=
t that also is relevant to discrimination that could be targeted at people =
because of their race, because of a perceived disability, because somebody =
is pregnant, because somebody doesn't speak English very well.  We believe =
people should be treated the same and afforded the same kind of opportuniti=
es, regardless of these specific individual characteristics.

     Q    Isn't the mention of transgender patients -- isn't that specific?=
  Isn't that new?  Isn't that different?

     MR. EARNEST:  All of what I've laid out is a new part of the rule that=
's been issued today.

     Q    What was the harm, in terms of the transgender community?  Was th=
ere some identifiable problem out there that required this clarification or=
 this augmentation to the rule?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, again, Ron, this is much broader than just applyin=
g to the transgender community.  But the transgender community is included.=
  In the same way that we want to prevent discrimination against pregnant w=
omen, we want to make sure that we're preventing discrimination against tra=
nsgendered women.  In the same way that we're preventing discrimination aga=
inst people who don't speak English very well or people who have a specific=
 disability, we want to make sure that transgendered men are not discrimina=
ted against either.

     Q    Specifically because there's some concern in that community about=
 access to transition drugs and medications and services, was that somethin=
g that the administration was concerned about in terms of trying to, I gues=
s you could say, refine this rule?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, I guess in terms of the way that it has an impact =
on individual health care decisions, I'd refer you to Health and Human Serv=
ices for answering that question.  But, look, the idea behind this specific=
 rule is to prevent discrimination against a wide range of groups.

     Q    One other area.  There are these reports about immigration raids =
that are supposedly happening during May.  You've heard even Secretary Clin=
ton and Senator Sanders comment on this.  There's the belief that the admin=
istration is going to conduct huge raids during May and June, rallying up s=
ignificant numbers of women and children, recent people who have crossed th=
e country in significant numbers.  Is that true?  Is there something differ=
ent happening now?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, this is an excellent question.  We're talking abou=
t a DHS enforcement action, so there are some limitations about what I can =
say, but let me help you understand exactly the policy that DHS is implemen=
ting.  And I think I can largely answer your question.

The first is -- and this is something that Secretary Johnson himself has sa=
id -- that the operations that are underway are merely the continuation of =
operations that were announced in January and in March.  And those operatio=
ns are conducted under the rubric of the guidance that President Obama and =
Secretary Johnson put in place in November of 2014.  And that is guidance t=
hat made a priority of individuals who are convicted criminals or otherwise=
 a threat to public safety, or individuals who were apprehended after cross=
ing the border after January 1st of 2014.

     So we've made clear that our priorities are people who pose a threat t=
o the community, people who are convicted criminals, or people who have onl=
y recently crossed the border.  So those priorities remain in place, and th=
ose priorities are followed even as these operations continue.

     Let me say two more things.  The first is, no one is removed if they h=
ave an ongoing, pending claim or appeal for asylum or some other form of hu=
manitarian relief.  People are given access to due process.  And that is a =
foundational principle for all of this.  So the only people who are the tar=
gets of these operations are people who are subject to an order by an immig=
ration court for removal and people who have also, in addition to being sub=
ject to that order, have exhausted any potential claims that they have for =
humanitarian relief.

     The last thing is DHS enforcement agents also follow what I understand=
 is to be longstanding guidance that ensures that these operations are not =
conducted in sensitive places.  These operations are not conducted in schoo=
ls or hospitals or places of worship, for example.

     Q    So is there no reason to fear that the numbers of deportations ar=
en't going to increase or spike -- whatever words you want to use now -- be=
cause there's something, a specific operation underway that's different fro=
m what's normally happening there along the border?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, again, what Secretary Johnson has described is tha=
t the operations that are underway now are a continuation of operations tha=
t were previously announced.

     But look, I think we would anticipate that the deportation numbers wou=
ld continue to go up.  This administration is serious about enforcing the l=
aw.  And I recognize that our political opponents don't like to acknowledge=
 that fact.  But we've made clear how we're going to use law enforcement re=
sources to enhance or border security and to enhance the security of commun=
ities across the country.  Most importantly, we're going to enforce our law=
s.

     And this is something that President Obama is committed to.  And the t=
ruth is, we would have a whole lot more resources to do exactly that if Rep=
ublicans in the House of Representatives had not blocked comprehensive immi=
gration reform legislation that did include an historic investment in our b=
order security.  But we do not enjoy the benefits of that border security t=
oday because House Republicans blocked the passage of that legislation.

     Q    And just lastly, it's not your political opponents -- well, some =
of the people who are objecting to this or raising concerns about this are =
Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, who I wouldn't think you'd consider =
political opponents.

     MR. EARNEST:  No, but it's our political opponents who suggest that Pr=
esident Obama is not interested in enforcing the law.  And I think that is =
demonstrably false.  That's that point that I'm making.  That's the reason =
that we're having this conversation right now.

     Anita.  Oh, Leslie, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

     Q    That's okay.  She was here yesterday.

     MR. EARNEST:  She was.  It's nice to see you, Leslie.

     Q    That's fine, thanks.  I had a couple questions on the gender guid=
elines you sent out last night.  Given that North Carolina's House Bill 2, =
that's sort of part of this, is headed to the courts, why did the White Hou=
se feel the need to put out this directive to the law?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, this is a directive that is responsive to requests=
 that we've received all across the country from school administrators and =
teachers and parents and others.  So this is not a response to the ongoing =
legal dispute related to HB2.  This is a response to requests that the Depa=
rtment of Education has received from teachers and administrators all acros=
s the country.

     Q    But you've cautioned before about being careful of not putting yo=
ur finger on the scale.  Doesn't this sort of suggest that you're putting t=
he White House's finger on the scale?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, we've been quite clear about the need to keep enfo=
rcement actions separate from any sort of political interference.  This is =
not an enforcement action.  This is a policy decision that was made by the =
Department of Education.  And, yes, the White House was appropriately invol=
ved in coordinating that policy decision.  But ultimately it's the responsi=
bility of the Department of Education to make this policy decision and to c=
ommunicate it to the schools and administrators all across the country.

     Notably, it's not an enforcement action.  It does not add a requiremen=
t to the applicable law.  And it doesn't pose any requirements on students =
for the use of shared facilities.

     Q    One of the other questions I had for you.  You mentioned -- you w=
ere asked about the lieutenant governor's comments on it, and you said that=
 it runs the risk -- or it underscores the risk of electing a right-wing ra=
dio host.

     MR. EARNEST:  To statewide office, yes.

     Q    Yes, to statewide office.  Yes.

     MR. EARNEST:  Yes.  (Laughter.)

     Q    Given that the White House last year when the Supreme Court ruled=
 on same-sex marriage, the White House put the lights out on the fountain, =
how much of this was a political consideration in doing these guidelines?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, I think as I pointed out before, the guidelines co=
ntain practical advice and suggestions for school administrators across the=
 country that have to deal with this challenge inside their communities.  T=
hey don't have the luxury of relying on political arguments that are an att=
empt to try to score some political points that propose to address a soluti=
on to a problem that doesn't actually exist.  These are school administrato=
rs who are trying to do the right thing.  They're trying to promote an atmo=
sphere of dignity and security for the students and their schools.  And so =
what the Department of Education has put forward are practical suggestions =
for how exactly they can do that consistent with civil rights law.

Q    And the White House is not looking to score any political points on it=
, even though it's been hailed by a number of organizations as a new fronti=
er in same-sex law?

MR. EARNEST:  Well, I'm not surprised to hear that there are people who agr=
ee that we shouldn't discriminate against people because of who they are.  =
I think most Americans agree with that notion.  So that's part of why I ant=
icipate that school administrators across the country would welcome this gu=
idance.

Look, I'll also say, I think school administrators across the country who d=
on't agree with the politics of this administration will also welcome these=
 suggestions, because they recognize that they have a challenge that they h=
ave to deal with and that, frankly, they don't have the luxury of engaging =
in a partisan political argument with a right-wing radio host.  In fact, wh=
at they have to do is they have to provide for the safety and dignity of th=
e students who are under their care.  And that's exactly what this guidance=
 does, is it gives them some useful tools for considering a range of option=
s that they can use to do exactly that.

So this has very little to do with politics, except for our critics who wan=
t to make this entirely about politics.  This administration is interested =
in providing workable, practical solutions to school administrators who are=
 trying to provide for the safety and dignity of the students under their c=
are.

Thanks, Leslie.  Mark.

Q    Josh, is it the intention of the administration that the guidance lett=
er be seen as a threat to deny federal funds to school districts that don't=
 comply with the policy decisions as interpreted by DOE and DOJ?

MR. EARNEST:  No, they should not view it that way.  They should view this =
as guidance, as specific suggestions and a framework for dealing with a ver=
y straightforward challenge:  How do school administrators, all across the =
country, ensure that they're protecting both the safety and dignity of ever=
y single student at the school.  It's as simple as that.  And what the Depa=
rtment of Education has done is they've drawn on their own internal experti=
se, and they've drawn on the creative solutions that have been implemented =
by school administrators all across the country to put all that good inform=
ation in one place and provide some practical advice to school administrato=
rs who are trying to solve this problem.  And that's a good thing.

I think what is true, what is undeniably true is the foundation of this gui=
dance is the principle that people shouldn't be discriminated against just =
because of who they are.  And school administrators don't have a glamorous =
job.  These are individuals who, I think in most cases, feel quite passiona=
te about their work.  They view their work as a calling.  They're looking t=
o prepare the next generation of Americans to succeed.  And they want to cr=
eate a learning environment where every student can feel safe, where every =
student can feel included, where every student can feel respected.  That's =
what the vast majority of school administrators are interested in, and that=
's why I think the vast majority of school administrators are going to use =
this guidance, they're going to carefully consider the suggestions that hav=
e been put forward by the Department of Education, and they're going to put=
 forward a solution that works in their community.  That's the way this sho=
uld work.

Q    Could you see how some might see the guidance letter as an implied thr=
eat of loss of federal funds, being that you mentioned that under the provi=
sions of Title IX, schools that receive federal funds are obligated to comp=
ly with the provisions that are stated forth in the guidance letter?

MR. EARNEST:  Look, there is a desire in the guidance to be as clear as pos=
sible about why this guidance is being issued.  But look, it's quite clear =
what we're interested in here.  The Department of Education is interested i=
n providing guidance and suggestions to school administrators who are tryin=
g to do the right thing.  And that right thing is to prevent people from be=
ing discriminated against, but also make sure that every single student in =
their school has their safety and their dignity protected.

Q    On another issue -- do you have any further guidance on the WASPs legi=
slation?

MR. EARNEST:  I do not.  This is the bill about the --

Q    Women Airforce Service Pilots.

MR. EARNEST:  Yes, the World War II women Airforce veterans -- pilots.  I d=
o not believe that we have received that from Congress yet.  I don't know i=
f we've got an update on that.  But we'll be tracking that, and we'll keep =
you posted on that status.  But the President does intend to sign it.

Q    Right.  And you said yesterday.  Do you know why the President could n=
ot have, as Commander-in-Chief, directed the Army to allow a burial for the=
se women at Arlington without legislation?

MR. EARNEST:  I don't know exactly how the law works.  I don't know if his =
authority as Commander-in-Chief could have been used for that purpose.  But=
 we certainly welcomed the bipartisan legislation from Congress that would =
make the use of that -- or the exercise of that authority unnecessary, beca=
use Congress has passed a law making it possible.

Chris.

Q    Thanks.  Everyone is in my business today.

MR. EARNEST:  I'm sorry?

Q    Everyone is in my business today.  (Laughter.)

MR. EARNEST:  I know, man.  (Laughter.)  You got to elbow those people out.

Q    Yesterday, you said that there was a determination, as a result of mul=
tiagency review, that there would be no loss of federal funds at this time =
to North Carolina as a result of possible domain.com.  But at the same time, this=
 guidance on transgender students is issued.  Isn't that sending a mixed me=
ssage?

MR. EARNEST:  Well, no, I don't think it's a mixed message.  I think it's i=
mportant for people to understand what's happening here.  This guidance tha=
t was put forward by the Department of Education does not impose any new re=
quirements under the applicable law.  It's guidance that's issued to school=
 administrators in school districts all across the country.

The conversation that we've been having over the course of this week has la=
rgely been centered on the state of North Carolina and what impact their la=
w could have on their compliance with the Civil Rights Act.  So it was rela=
ted to a specific piece of legislation that was passed almost literally in =
the dark of night by the legislation that convened a one-day special sessio=
n to pass this bill.  It was signed the same day by the governor.  And the =
rebuke from business leaders in North Carolina and business leaders who are=
 contemplating doing business in North Carolina has been forceful.  And I t=
hink it's an indication that the legislation that was passed by the state l=
egislature was much more -- was much broader than just something that would=
 apply in an educational setting.

So the situations are quite different.  I think they do illustrate how cons=
istent and forceful this administration has been about fighting against the=
 idea that people could be discriminated against because of who they are.  =
That's a principle the President does feel strongly about.  It's obviously =
a principle that Attorney General Lynch spoke movingly about.  And preventi=
ng discrimination and treating people fairly is a core principle that does =
guide a lot of the policy that's made by the Obama administration.  But the=
 enforcement action that was announced by the Attorney General this week wa=
s enforcement action that was the decision of attorneys at the Department o=
f Justice.  That decision was not influenced by White House officials.  The=
 notification that was distributed by the Department of Education today is =
not an enforcement action; it was a policy decision that did include some W=
hite House involvement, but was the realm and responsibility of the Departm=
ent of Education.

     Q    But nonetheless, given that the major component of House Bill 2 i=
s that transgender students in North Carolina are prohibited from using the=
 restroom consistent with their gender identity, doesn't that necessarily m=
ean that even if schools not to follow this guidance that the Department of=
 Education has put out, that they will not suffer a loss of federal funds?

MR. EARNEST:  Well, what this says is -- well, the way this works is that i=
f there are schools -- and I think they will be in the minority -- but if t=
here are schools across the country that do come forward and indicate that =
they do not intend to be in compliance with this guidance, then there is an=
 established process for litigating those differences with the Department o=
f Education.  So there's an established process for this.  We don't have to=
 invent one.

Q    And was it planned to make the announcement that there would be no los=
s of federal funds for North Carolina at this time, in conjunction with the=
 announcement from the Department of Education and Justice for this guidanc=
e for transgender students?  Was that coincidental?

MR. EARNEST:  No, these were separate actions.  So, again, as it relates to=
 North Carolina in consideration of HB2, the policy decision that was made,=
 even as agencies were considering whether or not the passage and implement=
ation of HB2 would put a range of federally funded programs at risk in the =
state of North Carolina, the decision that was made was to not withhold any=
 funding until the enforcement action that was announced by the Department =
of Justice had made its way through the courts.  So that was a very specifi=
c thing, and that was a response to developments that occurred this week wi=
th regard to the situation in North Carolina.

This guidance is guidance that has been in the works for years, but it is g=
uidance that is broadly consistent with the kinds of principles that this P=
resident and this administration has long fought for.

Q    One last question.  Even after you said yesterday, with regard to HB2,=
 that there would be no loss of federal funds to the state as the enforceme=
nt action is ongoing in the courts, a Department of Education spokesperson =
said the review there is ongoing.  Do you know why the spokesperson would h=
ave said that?

MR. EARNEST:  I don't.  But this is a little complicated, so it may have ju=
st been a bit of a miscommunication.  But as it relates specifically to HB2=
, no federal agencies will be making a decision to withhold funding as a re=
sult of HB2 until the DOJ enforcement process has worked its way through th=
e courts.

Margaret.

Q    Josh, is this the extent of guidance like this?  Or do you foresee sim=
ilar directives to come from the administration?

MR. EARNEST:  Well, I'm not aware of any other -- I mean, when you say "lik=
e this," you mean guidance that could have an impact on --

Q    Well, you said that you had received inquiries from the educational co=
mmunity, that you're responding to it.  Have you received inquiries from ot=
her industries, companies, elsewhere, also demanding this kind of clarity o=
n how they should be treating transgender people?

MR. EARNEST:  It's certainly possible.  I'm not aware of any guidance that'=
s likely to attract the amount of interest that this one has.

Q    I'm going to go back to an idea you were talking about here with Kathl=
een.  Can you just clarify:  Does the President see this as a clear-cut civ=
il rights issue?

MR. EARNEST:  Well, I think there obviously is a question of civil rights h=
ere.  And there is a question of how can we ensure that the civil rights of=
 every student is protected.  There's also a question of how do we ensure t=
hat the dignity and safety of every student is protected.  And the guidance=
 that we have put forward would do both.  And again, I think that's why we'=
re going to see a lot of school administrators come forward and announce th=
eir intent to implement this guidance, or they're going just going to imple=
ment the guidance without announcing it.  Or, like many school administrato=
rs, they're already doing this kind of work to ensure the safety and domain.com=
y of every student at the school.

And this is the thing that I was mentioning before.  This is something that=
 over the last week or two has been a pretty loud part of the political deb=
ate.  But this is something that school administrators all across the count=
ry have been dealing with for quite some time.  So they don't have the luxu=
ry of falling back on talking points.  They've got to implement practical, =
real-world solutions that make a difference when it comes to the safety and=
 dignity of students at their school.  Posting a law enforcement officer ou=
tside of every bathroom, and checking the birth certificate of people who a=
re walking through the door -- that's not a practical solution.  That's not=
 going to enhance anybody's safety.  It's not going to enhance anybody's di=
gnity.  That's impractical.  It's rooted in a political argument that has v=
ery little grounding in actual facts.

     So I recognize that that is sort of something that politicians frequen=
tly do, which is make arguments that may sound good politically just to sco=
re some political points.  But to do that at the expense of students all ac=
ross the country is something I don't think that they should do.

     Q    And the question of civil rights, I mean, are you parsing here th=
at it's not a civil rights issue?  I mean, is this because the courts still=
 haven't ruled on whether there is protection under the law of transgender =
persons as a protected class, as an extension of sex discrimination?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, I think what's undeniable is this is an issue wher=
e case law is still being built up.  But, look, I think the reading of this=
 guidance I think is pretty common-sense.  You can't discriminate against p=
eople because of their gender identity.  You can't force people with a spec=
ific gender identity to use a different facility.  That's discriminating ag=
ainst them.

     What we should do is we should treat every student the same.  We shoul=
d protect every student's safety.  We should protect every student's domain.com=
y.  We should give every student access to individual-use facilities if tha=
t's what they prefer and they're available.  That's the cornerstone here of=
 our argument.

     Q    You're saying the case law is still being built up, but you're no=
t going so far as to say that this is on shaky legal ground because we stil=
l haven't seen the federal protection?

     MR. EARNEST:  I don't mean to telegraph any lack of confidence in the =
legal conclusion that's been reached here.  The law is clear.  And I think =
it should be notable that it's not just the Department of Education that si=
gned on to this, but the Department of Justice has too.

     The point that I'm trying to make, Margaret, is that this is something=
 that is relatively new.  This is a relatively new policy consideration tha=
t school administrators are having to make.  This is a relatively new eleme=
nt of our political debate.

     I was thinking about Chris earlier today because there was some discus=
sion about whether or not the word "transgender" had ever been uttered from=
 the White House podium before.  And I think that's a pretty apt illustrati=
on of how this debate is changing and has emerged.  So it's new to our poli=
tical debate, but this is not new when you consider what school administrat=
ors have had to do to ensure the safety and security of every student at th=
eir school.  This is something that they have to deal with every day.  And =
that's why most of them don't have a lot of tolerance for a bunch of cheap =
political rhetoric.  They're looking for solutions.  And solutions are exac=
tly what were provided by the Department of Education in their letter today=
.

     Rich.

     Q    Thanks, Josh.  You're saying that this is a problem that school a=
dministrators are dealing with, but then it was also a problem that didn't =
exist until it entered this political realm.  How long has the administrati=
on been getting questions about this?  And did the North Carolina law promp=
t this guidance or speed its timeline?

     MR. EARNEST:  It did not.  This is guidance that had been in the works=
 for years.  This is relatively new to our political debate, but again, thi=
s is something that has been the source of questions that the Department of=
 Education has received for a number of years now.  And again, those questi=
ons to the Department of Education were not rooted in the desire of a high =
school principal to make a political argument.  It was rooted in the desire=
 of a high school principal to get some advice and to rely on the experts a=
t the Department of Education to help him or her ensure the safety and dign=
ity of every single student at their school.  That's what these principals =
are looking for.

     Look, in most cases, principals aren't making a whole lot of money.  I=
t's not a glamorous job.  But they do it because they care deeply about our=
 children.  They care deeply about providing a good, quality education to o=
ur kids.  They care deeply about the future of this country.  They care dee=
ply about ensuring that a learning environment that they are responsible fo=
r managing is one that's respectful, that's inclusive, and that is safe.  A=
nd that's the kind of guidance that they were seeking from the Department o=
f Education about how best to accomplish those goals.

     Q    Doesn't the administration think, though, or acknowledge at least=
, that there still is a very difficult process here?  For example, the guid=
ance says that when a student or the student's parent or guardian, as appro=
priate, notifies the administration that the student will assert a gender i=
dentity that differs from their previous representations, the school will b=
egin treating that student consistent with the gender identity.  And then i=
t goes on to say the gender transition can happen swiftly or over a long du=
ration of time.  If a principal is sitting in front of a student, there cou=
ld be questions of clarity, sincerity.  These are all things that are still=
 not answered and out there, right?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, I think this goes to Ron's question.  We acknowled=
ge -- and, in fact, this is what should happen:  School administrators do h=
ave to make decisions about the best way to protect the dignity and safety =
of the students at their school.  And, yes, these are complicated issues, a=
nd that's setting aside even the kinds of arrangements that might be availa=
ble to a school administrator.  And so many of our schools are so wildly un=
derfunded, right?  So you face this question about are we going to build a =
new bathroom, or are we going to provide up-to-date textbooks in our scienc=
e classrooms.  These are practical questions that administrators are going =
to have to answer for themselves.

     That's why it would not be wise for the federal government to be impos=
ing a solution or adding an additional requirement under the law.  That's, =
in fact, why we have not done that, because we believe in the value and the=
 importance of local control of schools.  So we want schools and we want sc=
hool administrators to be reaching the kinds of conclusions and the kinds o=
f solutions that are in the best interests of that community and that are i=
n the best interests of the students who attend that school.

     So that's also why you've seen the U.S. Department of Education draw u=
pon solutions that have been implemented by schools all across the country =
and surfacing those good ideas and sharing them with other school administr=
ators that are trying to solve the same problem.  That's a pretty high-func=
tioning U.S. Department of Education providing a valuable service to school=
 administrators all across the country that are simply just trying to provi=
de a safe and inclusive learning environment for their kids.

     Q    Lastly, the administration has come out very strongly on these is=
sues, with the action against North Carolina, with its guidance today.  And=
 those are domestic issues.  Internationally, the United States still has r=
elationships with and gives aid to countries that puts LGBT people behind b=
ars, charges them and executes them.  Is the U.S. going to exert its influe=
nce internationally on this?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, Rich, I would tell you that we do.  The President =
strongly advocates for the rights of all people when he travels around the =
world.  And we certainly have made direct statements -- let me say it this =
way.  The President has been crystal-clear both in public settings, but als=
o in private settings, in his conversations with world leaders about our ex=
pectation and the priority that we place in this country on human rights.

     Q    So we threaten funding?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, I think that that has been a question that has bee=
n discussed in a number of other settings about whether or not significant =
human rights violations undermine the relationship that the United States h=
as with other countries, or in some cases, could even interrupt funding tha=
t is provided by the United States to other countries.

     There was an amusing situation a couple of years ago where there were =
questions about whether or not the United States was going to interrupt the=
 federal aid that we provide to Egypt in the aftermath of a crackdown on po=
litical dissidents there.  Now, that situation is not funny, but it did pro=
voke an amusing response here as I tried to describe the way that funding i=
s provided to individual countries and tranches, and so some people had som=
e fun with that.

     But it underscores that this is a policy priority of the President whe=
n he travels around the world.  I've sat in rooms where the President is ta=
lking to world leaders, and the President of the United States respectfully=
 but directly raises concerns about the treatment of minorities in their co=
untries, including the rights of gays and lesbians, and the rights of domain.com=
ical dissidents, the rights of women, the rights of journalists.  And, look=
, as a country, these are values that we are deeply invested in and we use =
our influence around the world to try to advance those values.  And the Pre=
sident makes that case rather forcefully, both in public and in private, on=
 American soil and when he's abroad.

     Q    Quickly on the guidance.  Do you expect lawsuits?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, again, what I expect is that the vast majority of =
school administrators are going to take a look at this guidance and figure =
out a way to implement it in their schools.

     Kenneth.

     Q    Josh, thank you.  To follow up to the follow-up to the follow-up =
on the question of transgender guidance.

     MR. EARNEST:  I'm summoning a lot of patience today.

     Q    Does the administration in its final months expect to issue any m=
ore guidance on topics, issues that the Education Department is dealing wit=
h?  For instance, there's a hearing that happened this morning where mother=
s said that football slowly killed her son because of concussions.  So I'm =
curious, are there any other directives or issues or guidance that the admi=
nistration plans to give out that impacts the nation's children, like guida=
nce on CTE?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, I don't have any announcements about additional De=
partment of Education guidance that's likely to be issued in the months ahe=
ad.  You can certainly check with the Department of Education to see if the=
y can give you a preview of what other policies they may have in store.

     Q    On Zika, back to that for a second here.  You mentioned yesterday=
 a list of things that the Republican-led Congress has not done, such as Zi=
ka, Puerto Rico, opioid addiction.  Well, the House passed --

     MR. EARNEST:  Passing a budget.

     Q    Passing a budget.  The House passed 18 bills on opioid addiction =
yesterday.  And on Zika, I know you mentioned that the funding is not on th=
e current legislation that's making its way through right now.  Does the Pr=
esident expect to pass these pieces of legislation if they reach his desk? =
 And are you championing the bipartisan effort by the Florida senators, Rub=
io and Nelson, to give fully funded $1.9 billion?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, we certainly welcome the bipartisan support that o=
ur Zika proposal has received, including from Senator Rubio.  I think this =
reflects the degree to which, for all of our policy differences with Senato=
r Rubio, when it comes to looking out for the public health and wellbeing o=
f the American people, there shouldn't be a partisan difference.  And I thi=
nk Senator Rubio and Senator Nelson both understand the consequences for mo=
thers and babies in Florida of not doing everything possible to fight Zika.=
  So we certainly welcome that show of bipartisan support from Senator Rubi=
o and Senator Nelson, and hope that the United States Senate and the United=
 States House will listen to the advice of our public health experts.

     The $1.9 billion number was not chosen at random -- it actually reflec=
ts the sum total of efforts that our public health professionals say they c=
an and should take over the long term to protect the American people from Z=
ika.  So if there are some public health professionals in the United States=
 Congress that have looked at this carefully enough to offer up their own a=
lternative, they can do that.  But $1.9 billion is what our public health p=
rofessionals say that we need.  $1.9 billion is what our bipartisan governo=
rs from all across the country believe that Congress should provide so that=
 they can fight Zika in their communities.

     So there's strong bipartisan support for our proposal because it's roo=
ted in the facts, because it's rooted based on the advice of the top scient=
ists in the country.  That's why we welcome the support of Republican senat=
ors like Senator Rubio.   That's why we welcome the support of Democratic a=
nd Republican governors.  And we would welcome bipartisan congressional pas=
sage of some legislation that's long overdue.

     Q    But would the President sign anything less than the $1.9 billion =
request?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, this is a process that, unfortunately, is still wo=
rking its way through the United States Congress.  We would have liked to h=
ave seen Congress begin this effort many months ago.  The President convene=
d a meeting with his national security team and his public health experts i=
n January to discuss this issue.  Just a couple of weeks later, he signaled=
 his intent to request resources from Congress.  Just a couple of weeks aft=
er that, we put forward a specific proposal that detailed how that $1.9 bil=
lion would be spent.

     So we worked at a very rapid pace over the winter to put forward this =
request.  Three months now have gone by, almost three months, and we've see=
n very little movement from Congress, and that's been quite disappointing. =
 But maybe as people like Senator Rubio weigh in and demonstrate bipartisan=
 support for this recommendation from our public health professionals, mayb=
e we'll build up some momentum here.

     Suzanne.

     Q    Josh, on another issue.  On the day that the President is hosting=
 several world leaders -- the refugee crisis, it was back in September that=
 he pledged he wanted to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees into the country by t=
he end of fiscal 2016, October.  So you have some time, but the latest Stat=
e Department statistic is showing just a little more than 2,000.  Is the ad=
ministration confident that you'll reach your goal of 10,000 by October?  A=
nd can you also explain some of the delays and the slower-than-expected pro=
cess that they've gone through?  What's been some of the issues?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, Suzanne, the challenge here is simply this -- that=
 individuals who enter the United States through the refugee program are su=
bjected to more screening, more background checks than any other individual=
 who tries to enter the United States.  These individuals have to undergo a=
 background check, they're interviewed in person, biometric data about them=
 is collected, and then all of that information is then run through databas=
es that are maintained by the United States military, U.S. intelligence age=
ncies, other national security organizations in the United States, but also=
 law enforcement organizations in the United States and law enforcement org=
anizations overseas.

     So all of that work takes time.  And the President was clear that we'r=
e not going to cut corners when it comes to security, even as we meet this =
ambitious goal.  So I don't think anybody was under the expectation that th=
ere would be a linear increase in the number of refugees that would be admi=
tted to the United States.  I think we always contemplated that this is a p=
rogram that would ramp up over time as we added capacity and as we added ou=
r capacity to conduct these background checks.

     So there's no denying that there's a lot of work to do to meet this go=
al.  It is an ambitious goal and it will be challenging to get it done.  Bu=
t last year around this time, there were questions raised about whether or =
not we would meet our previous refugee goal because we'd fallen behind pace=
.  But yet, based on the good work of our professionals at the Department o=
f State and the Department of Homeland Security, we did succeed in meeting =
that goal last year.  And the President has made clear that meeting the mor=
e ambitious goal this year is a top priority.  And I'm confident that all t=
he people who are working on this problem understands the priority that the=
 President has placed on this issue.

     Q    How has the political rhetoric, the harsh language, and some of t=
he fear that's been drummed up around immigration and around the refugee cr=
isis impacted the administration's ability to get them through the pipeline=
?

     MR. EARNEST:  I don't think it's had an impact.  The people who are wo=
rking on this inside the U.S. government are professionals, and they unders=
tand exactly what needs to be done when it comes to implementing these vigo=
rous background checks.  They understand why it's important that a thorough=
 vetting be conducted before refugees are admitted to this country.  And th=
at's what they're doing.  And the political noise has not impacted their ab=
ility to do their jobs.

     Q    And just to be clear, the administration is confident it will be =
able to reach its goal of 10,000?

     MR. EARNEST:  I am confident that the people who are operating this pr=
ogram understand that the President of the United States thinks this is a t=
op priority, and they have work to do to meet this challenging goal.  So we=
 certainly intend to reach this goal.

     Q    Hi, Josh.  Thank you.  Going back to immigration, many of the cri=
tics -- immigration critics have called for refugee status for the Central =
American families.  Will there be any action on that?  And would you say th=
at this is in correlation to the spike of Central American families crossin=
g the border, that have been apprehended at the border in the last few mont=
hs?

     MR. EARNEST:  No, it's not.  As Secretary Johnson has indicated, the o=
perations that are underway are a continuation of operations that were prev=
iously announced.  At the same time, I do think it is important for people =
who are in Central America and contemplating making the dangerous journey t=
hrough Mexico to try to get to the United States, these operations should m=
ake clear that that's not an option -- that's not a viable option.

     It should also make clear to parents in particular that child smuggler=
s who say they can sneak their kids into the United States are not telling =
the truth.  And, in fact, entrusting your children to those smugglers is da=
ngerous and we strongly encourage people not to do it.

     So that's an important thing.  It's important for people to understand=
 what the policy is in the United States.  It's also important for people t=
o understand what we have tried to do.  And what we have tried to do is to =
enhance the assistance that the United States provides to countries like Gu=
atemala and Honduras.  Last year, in the omnibus budget proposal, about $70=
0 million was provided by Congress to improve the security situation in som=
e of those countries or make contributions to try to improve the security s=
ituation there and try to address some of the root causes that would prompt=
 people to undertake this dangerous journey.

     So if this serves to discourage people from considering to make this j=
ourney, that would be a good thing.  But our motivation for carrying out th=
ese operations is rooted in President Obama and Secretary Johnson's commitm=
ent to enforcing the law.  We're going to do that in a way that is humane. =
 We're going to make sure that people have access to due process.  The only=
 people who would be subject to operations like this are people who are sub=
ject to an order of removal by an immigration court.

     The only people who could be part of an operation like this and remove=
d from the country would be people who have exhausted any sort of claims fo=
r asylum or humanitarian relief.  So there are rules that govern this, but =
at the end of the day, the President is serious about enforcing the law.  T=
he President does continue to believe that there is a better way, and that =
comprehensive immigration reform legislation through Congress would improve=
 the way that we manage our immigration system in this country.

     Q    But there is no viable way for refugee status for these Central A=
merican families?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, there has been a discussion about working with the=
 United Nations to allow people in Central America to apply for asylum and =
be considered, be carefully vetted for inclusion in some sort of refugee pr=
ocess.  And we have worked diligently with the United Nations to try to get=
 that process up and running.  There's still a lot of work to do with regar=
d to establishing that program, but there has been some consideration that'=
s been given to that idea.

What's notable about that is that is an application process that doesn't be=
gin in the United States, it actually begins in Central America.  And, agai=
n, that should serve as an encouragement for people who are interested and =
think that they may be eligible for that kind of humanitarian relief that t=
hey can apply for it in their home country.  They don't have to undertake t=
he dangerous journey to try to get to the United States.  They don't have t=
o trust a smuggler.  They can apply for that status in their home country.

     Q    Josh, as you know, data out today show pretty sharp increases in =
murder rates in the last few months in about 20 different cities.  Is that =
a reason for concern?  And do you have any more to say on Comey's interpret=
ation of that data?

     MR. EARNEST:  I don't have anything to say beyond what I said yesterda=
y.  I will say that when Director Comey was talking about this he acknowled=
ged that there's a lot of ambiguity about the broader trends, because in so=
me parts of the country we haven't seen an increase in violent crime and, o=
verall, crime across the country is at or near historic lows.  The example =
that he raised that I think is an illustrative one is that we have seen a s=
pike in violent crime in Dallas, but not in Houston.  So the question is wh=
at accounts for that differing environment?

And so we've got experts at the Department of Justice who are taking a look=
 at these situations.  What President Obama did last year was actually dire=
ct his Attorney General to ramp up the assistance that we can provide to lo=
cal law enforcement that is trying to fight these violent crime spikes in s=
ome communities in the country.  And that additional assistance has taken a=
 variety of forms.  It has included widespread sting operations that were c=
arried out by U.S. marshals to round up individuals who were wanted for vio=
lent crimes.  There's also additional assistance that's been provided to in=
dividual law enforcement organizations to improve training of their law enf=
orcement officers to make them more effective.

So there is some assistance that the federal government can provide to law =
enforcement agencies that are dealing with these kinds of spikes.  But it i=
s unclear what's contributing to those spikes, because we do know that as a=
 general matter, all across the country crime rates remain at or near histo=
ric lows.

Q    You dismissed his notion that there is some sort of Ferguson effect an=
d I think you talked about there's no evidence to back that up.  I guess wh=
at I'm trying to understand is do you think that he is wrong, or do you thi=
nk that he just doesn't have the evidence to substantiate what he said?  Th=
ere's sort of a difference -- either you're not sure, or you're sure he's w=
rong. Can you help me untangle that?

MR. EARNEST:  I think the point that I was making yesterday is -- and this =
is based on a conversation I had with the President -- this administration =
makes policy decisions that are rooted in evidence, that are rooted in scie=
nce.  We can't make broad, sweeping policy decisions or draw policy conclus=
ions based on anecdotal evidence.  That's irresponsible and ultimately coun=
terproductive.

The President actually has a lot of confidence in the vast majority of law =
enforcement officers all across the country to do their jobs and to do them=
 well and to do them selflessly and to do them in a way that is effective i=
n fighting crime and protecting civil rights at the same time.  The Preside=
nt does not believe -- at least he has not seen evidence to substantiate th=
e suggestion that there are a significant number of police officers out the=
re who are unwilling to do their job because they fear being filmed by some=
body's cellphone.

But, look, if there's evidence that materializes to substantiate that claim=
, then we should figure out something to do about it.  So I guess the point=
 is there isn't evidence out there to draw any firm conclusions about what'=
s happening.  The President does have a lot of confidence in the vast major=
ity of law enforcement officers that are selflessly protecting our domain.com=
ies and doing it in the right way.  But we should look at this problem and =
get to the bottom of what exactly is going on.

And Director Comey did indicate that it's unclear what's going on.  He ackn=
owledged that it's a complicated situation.  That's where he used the Dalla=
s-Houston comparison to illustrate that there is no clear answer to what's =
going on here, and what Director Comey said is we need to spend more time t=
rying to figure out what's happening.  And he's right about that.  And we s=
hould use the evidence that is uncovered to formulate an appropriate politi=
cs response.  And that's what the President believes the priority should be=
.

Q    Josh, I mean, there's a lot of uncertainty about everything.  You guys=
 are swimming in uncertainty.  We all are.  I mean, one has to act in the f=
ace of uncertainty anyway.  You're suggesting, it seems to me, that you're =
not acting because you don't have evidence, when, in fact, in nearly every =
case, you have to act in the face of uncertainty anyway.  Can you help me s=
ort of, again, untangle that?

MR. EARNEST:  I think what I would say is we do often -- the President ofte=
n talks about this, about how often uncertainty impacts the decisions that =
he's required to make as the President of the United States.  That uncertai=
nty typically applies to situations in which there are no guarantees that w=
hat the President is prepared to choose will work.

So, for example, if we determine that the so-called Ferguson effect is pote=
ntially contributing to an increase in crime, then we need to sit down and =
figure out what can we do to address it. And there will be some uncertainty=
 about whether or not that will work.  But there won't be uncertainty about=
 the fact that we're trying to solve the right problem, that we're trying t=
o solve a problem that actually exists, and so collecting evidence to verif=
y what is possible to know even if, once we get to the stage of considering=
 solutions, there will naturally be some uncertainty about what the future =
holds.  But even in that case, there will be some evidence to inform the ch=
oices that the President has to make.

Q    You've got more dead bodies.  I mean, that's clearly a problem.  Wheth=
er --

MR. EARNEST:  No, no, I'm not denying that there is a problem as it relates=
 to the spike in violent crime in some communities across the country.  Tha=
t's why the President, last year, ordered the Attorney General to provide s=
ome additional assistance to law enforcement agencies.  We saw the Marshals=
 Service carry out a widespread sweep that resulted in about 8,000 fugitive=
s being captured.  So there's plenty of evidence to indicate that there are=
 some communities -- again, this is not a widespread phenomenon, at least b=
ased on what we know now -- but there is evidence to indicate that there ar=
e some communities, including the President's hometown of Chicago, that are=
 experiencing a troubling surge in violent crime.  And the President has or=
dered action, specific action to try to address it.

But there's not evidence at this point to link that surge in violent crime =
to the so-called viral video effect, or the Ferguson effect.  There's just =
no evidence to substantiate that. And there's some anecdotal evidence to in=
dicate that that may be having some impact, but there's plenty of anecdotal=
 evidence that the vast majority of law enforcement officers, men and women=
 across the country, are doing their job as well as ever; that they're figh=
ting crime, that they're protecting people's civil rights, that they're act=
ing selflessly and bravely to communicate -- or to protect the communities =
that they are sworn to serve and protect.

So that's the ambiguity that exists.  And that's what we need to get to the=
 bottom of before we start offering up specific solutions.

Q    On the transgender question, can you help us untangle the President's =
role himself?  Like did he play a direct role in the guidance?  Did he meet=
 with his Attorney General in the last week or recent weeks to discuss this=
?  Did he meet with his Education Secretary in the last week or the week be=
fore to discuss this?  Did he encourage the issue himself of this guidance?=
  And what in particular might have persuaded him that this was the right t=
hing to do?  So can you -- a little bit more about what President Obama him=
self, what role he played in this?

MR. EARNEST:  What I can tell you about the President is he was he was regu=
larly updated as this policy process moved forward.  So he was certainly aw=
are of the policy that was under deliberation by the Department of Educatio=
n.  And I can tell you that the outcome does reflect his view that the Depa=
rtment of Education should be responsive to requests that they've received =
from school administrators and that the Department of Education has an obli=
gation to put forward tangible, real-world suggestions for how this problem=
 can be addressed in communities all across the country.

The President also agrees that imposing an additional requirement under the=
 existing law is not something the Department of Education needs to be doin=
g right now.  So it's possible, and in fact, important for the U.S. Departm=
ent of Education to play an appropriate role in offering this guidance to s=
chool administrators that are trying to enhance the safety and protect the =
dignity of every student in their community.

Q    The suggestion is that he's sort of a bystander to this guidance comin=
g out -- that it was part of a process, that it came out of the departments=
, and he didn't really do much to encourage or discourage, it just sort of =
happened.  Is that an appropriate interpretation?  Or did he play a more ac=
tive role?

MR. EARNEST:  Well, obviously the President sets a longer-term vision for t=
he priorities that his administration is going to pursue.  I can't speak to=
 all of the conversations that President Obama has had with the Education S=
ecretary about this or other matters.  But I think it is fair to say -- and=
 I think it's important -- that this kind of announcement reflects the Pres=
ident's strongly held view about the need to prevent discrimination, but al=
so the need to protect the safety and dignity of every student in America.

So this does reflect the President's view.  But, at the same time, there's =
an established policy process for considering these kinds of questions and =
ensuring that the outcome reflects the priorities that were set by the Pres=
ident of the United States. In this case, they were.

     Q    In an interview with the Rutgers student newspaper, President Oba=
ma defended his administration's crackdown on leaks and press freedom by sa=
ying the prosecutions were a small sampling.  But the truth is the administ=
ration has targeted more whistleblowers and prosecuted more leak investigat=
ions -- including of my colleagues -- than all previous administrations com=
bined.  Can you explain the President's remarks?  Does he -- is he aware of=
 just how many more leak investigations this administration has conducted v=
ersus all of his predecessors?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, I don't think we're going to get deep into this to=
day.  But let me say a couple of things about this.  The first is, what the=
 President said is true, that a number of those investigations were initiat=
ed by the previous administration.  What is also true is questions of crimi=
nal investigations and criminal prosecutions are not influenced by the Pres=
ident or any other political operatives in the White House.  These are deci=
sions that are made by Department of Justice prosecutors.

     That's the way the process should work.  And it would be inappropriate=
 for the President to intervene either way.  It would be inappropriate for =
the President of the United States to intervene with the federal prosecutor=
 and say, you should go investigate this individual.  It would be just as i=
nappropriate for the President to intervene and say, you should lay off tha=
t guy from The New York Times.  That would be inappropriate too.

     We've got a Department of Justice that is insulated from politics for =
a very good reason.  And you should check with them for insight into the pr=
osecutorial decisions that attorneys at the Department of Justice were maki=
ng.

     Q    -- that these prosecutions took place during his administration? =
 I mean, he then went on to sort of talk about how his notion himself is th=
at there should be as much freedom as possible.  As you say, these prosecut=
ions took place during his administration, and your suggestion is that it t=
ook place essentially without any input from him or any of his direct -- in=
 the White House.

     MR. EARNEST:  And I'm suggesting it would be a genuine scandal if that=
 were not the case.

     Q    I think that's right.  So is he sorry that this number of prosecu=
tions took place during his administration, given the fact that he can do n=
othing about it?

     MR. EARNEST:  No.  I think the President does believe that people who =
swore an oath to protect sensitive information should follow it.  And the P=
resident does believe that the Department of Justice and other agencies hav=
e a role in enforcing that oath.  And that enforcement should take place wi=
thout regard to political considerations.  And there's just such an inquiry=
 that's going on right now that I'm not going to comment on, but I think is=
 an indication that this is something, at least when it comes to the handli=
ng of these kinds of matters by the Department of Justice, that should be f=
irmly insulated from politics, and therefore, insulated from influence by t=
he President of the United States.

     Q    Do you know of any previous state dinner that celebrated five cou=
ntries at once, Josh?

     MR. EARNEST:  I don't.  That would make tonight's event all the more s=
pecial.

     All right.  Jonathan, I'll give you the last one.  And then we'll do t=
he week ahead.

     Q    Okay, thank you.  The President is going to Rutgers on Sunday.  W=
hy did he decide to go to Rutgers?  Were any loud voices urging him to go? =
 And can you give us an advance preview of what he's going to say there?

     MR. EARNEST:  Well, for years, students and other leaders at Rutgers h=
ave been encouraging President Obama to consider delivering the commencemen=
t address this year because it's the 250th anniversary of the first commenc=
ement address -- the first commencement ceremonies that were hosted at Rutg=
ers.  So the President is looking forward to participating in this historic=
 occasion.  It certainly is the mark of a remarkable institution of higher =
learning.  I know that Rutgers, in particular, is quite proud of the class =
of 2016, and the President is looking forward to congratulating that class =
on all that they have achieved.

I think he'll have some observations about the world that they're prepared =
to enter.  They're prepared to enter a country and a domain.com that's rapidly =
changing.  And these students are as well-prepared as any students have eve=
r been to confront those challenges and use this changing environment to cr=
eate a better world.  And that's what makes the President so fundamentally =
optimistic about the future of our country, and that optimism is manifested=
 quite well in this year's graduating class at Rutgers.

     So with that, why don't I do a week ahead?

     Q    Will he domain.com the (inaudible) at all while he's at Rutgers?

     MR. EARNEST:  I don't have any notes about any unplanned, any domain.com=
led movements for the President, but we'll see if he is able to make the mo=
st of his domain.com to Rutgers.

     So on Sunday -- this is not written down here, but obviously on Sunday=
, the President will travel to New Jersey and deliver the commencement addr=
ess at the 250th commencement at Rutgers University.

     On Monday, the President will host a Medal of Valor ceremony at the Wh=
ite House.  The Medal of Valor is awarded to public safety officers who hav=
e exhibited exceptional courage, regardless of personal safety, in the atte=
mpt to save or protect others from harm.

     On Tuesday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House=
.

     On Wednesday, the President will participate in a Organizationroundtable.

     On Thursday, the President will award the National Medals of Science a=
nd Technology and Innovation to 17 scientists, engineers, mathematicians an=
d innovators.  The Medal of Science recognizes individuals who have made ou=
tstanding contributions to science, engineering and mathematics.  The Natio=
nal Medal of Technology and Innovation recognizes those who have made lasti=
ng contributions to America's competitiveness and quality of life and helpe=
d the nation's technological workforce.

     On Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.

     And then on Saturday, the President will depart Washington, D.C. en ro=
ute Hanoi, Vietnam.  This trip will highlight the President's ongoing commi=
tment to the U.S. rebalance to Asia and the Pacific, designed to increase U=
.S. diplomatic, economic, and security engagement with the country and peop=
les of the region.  So this is obviously next Saturday, a week from tomorro=
w, and we'll have a lot more to say about the President's trip to the Asia =
Pacific during next week's briefings.

     So with all that, I hope you guys all have a great weekend.  See you o=
n Monday.

     Q    Starting now?  (Laughter.)

     MR. EARNEST:  I resisted making that joke out of deference, but we'll =
pick it back up next week.
