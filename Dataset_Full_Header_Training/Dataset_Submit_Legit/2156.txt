** Inside Business Insider
------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Kludt's in-depth look at Business Insider is a must-read. (<<link>>
domain.com/2016/04/29/media/business-insider-staff-exodus/index.html?iid=3D=
SF_LN&mc_cid=3D7252372523&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID])  He emails this summary:

BI has been a wildly successful digital media company. It has also said go=
odbye to a couple dozen key editorial staffers since it was sold to Axel S=
pringer in the fall. Through conversations with current and former employe=
es=2C I got an explanation for both.

The BI newsroom mirrors the energy and temperament of its founder=2C the f=
ormer stock analyst Henry Blodget. He often gushes about his lofty vision=
 for the site =E2=80=93 like he did in January=2C when he circulated a mem=
o detailing his plan for BI to reach one billion monthly visitors. And he=
 is also known to push his staff to reach those goals =E2=80=93 like he di=
d last year=2C when he suggested that if employees were writing five posts=
 a day=2C perhaps they could shoot for six.

All of that helps explain how the company has created such a traffic behem=
oth; domain.com had more than 40 million unique visitors last mon=
th=2C making it the third most visited financial news site. But it also ex=
plains why 24 reporters and editors have left the newsroom since September=

** Reactions to Tom's story
------------------------------------------------------------
The story was quite a talker on Media Twitter today. Many=2C like CJR's Da=
vid Uberti=2C scoffed at the pace and demands shouldered by Business Insid=
er=E2=80=99s journalists. "At 5-6 posts a day=2C can you even think about=
 what you=E2=80=99re writing?" Uberti tweeted. (<<link>>

ibby Watson=2C a staff writer at the Sunlight Foundation=2C read the piece=
 and concluded (<<link>>
?mc_cid=3D7252372523&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) that working at BI "sounds pretty=
 miserable."

On the other hand=2C the FT's John Gapper said (<<link>>
pper/status/726100319646658561?mc_cid=3D7252372523&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) he=
=E2=80=99s "never encountered a workplace that wasn't all=2C 'morale has n=

** The ten-year anniversary of this
------------------------------------------------------------
It was ten years ago=2C at the 2015 WHCD dinner=2C when Stephen Colbert de=

** Will Ferrell and "Reagan"
------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa France reports: (<<link>>
rell-ronald-reagan-movie/index.html?mc_cid=3D7252372523&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]=
 ) "Will Ferrell has reportedly abandoned plans to play President Reagan a=

 Maybe the media got out ahead of Ferrell on this one? A spokesman told th=
e NY Post=2C "The REAGAN script is one of a number of scripts that had bee=
n submitted to Will Ferrell which he had considered. While it is by no mea=
ns a 'Alzheimer's comedy' as has been suggested=2C Mr. Ferrell is not purs=
uing this project."

Did some of this week's media coverage misrepresent what the project reall=
y is? I think so. THR has the must-read backstory about the script. (http:=
