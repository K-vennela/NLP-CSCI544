        Media inquiry re: Democratic Platform
Your Message
        Hello,

I sent a message to Ms. Brazile's Georgetown email as well, but will send i=
t here in case that doesn't get noticed.

I=92m a political reporter at Slate trying to do a story about the importan=
ce of the Democratic platform. Namely: how seriously is it taken since it=
=92s not really a binding document, what ability would the Sanders campaign=
 have to change it, and what flexibility Clinton might show in granting pla=
tform concessions to Sanders? It seems like she would have the numbers on t=
he platform committee to stave off his changes, but she also needs to keep =
his supporters in mind ahead of the general election.

If you have the time today I=92d love to chat. I=92m at (443) 223-6125. Tha=
nk you!
