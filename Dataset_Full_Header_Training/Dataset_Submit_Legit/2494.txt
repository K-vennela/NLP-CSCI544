Sen. Barbara Boxer of California on Wednesday sharply criticized her 2015 R=
epublican opponent, Carly Fiorina=97 whom Ted Cruz named Wednesday as his v=
ice presidential running mate<<<link>>
carly-fiorina-as-running-mate-1461781460>=97as a =93mean=94 campaigner who =
moved out of the state after voters =93rejected=94 her.

Ms. Boxer, who is stepping down next year from the U.S. Senate, defeated Ms=
. Fiorina 52% to 42% in 2010, during her last reelection battle=97a year th=
at saw many Republican victories elsewhere in the U.S.

Before Mr. Cruz named Ms. Fiorina as a running mate Wednesday, she had run =
a short-lived presidential campaign, dropping out of the race in February f=
ollowing poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.
In a conference call with reporters, Ms. Boxer criticized Ms. Fiorina=92s c=
ontroversial tenure as chief executive of Hewlett Packard, where she expand=
ed the company through the acquisition of Compaq Computer but also laid off=
 30,000 workers.  In 2005, she was fired by the board.

=93The most accurate description of that team would be: mean and meaner,=94=
 Ms. Boxer said of the Cruz-Fiorina pairing. =93He wants to ship immigrants=
 out of America, and she has already shipped jobs out of America, and they =
are the perfect duo, seriously.=94

=93I would predict, actually, that this Fiorina merger will be just as succ=
essful as her last one at HP,=94 Ms. Boxer said.

Ms. Fiorina, who is one of the few women to lead a large technology company=
, frames her HP tenure in a different light. She has said she successfully =
managed the company through a deep technology-industry downturn, and that h=
er leadership ultimately saved jobs. She now has her primary resident in Vi=
rginia.

The Wall Street Journal took a deep look at Ms. Fiorina=92s business record=
 last year<<<link>>
y-1444179445>, and found that Ms. Fiorina=92s vision and marketing talent o=
vershadowed her ability to deliver results, based on a review of the compan=
y=92s financials and interviews with contemporaries there.

Ms. Boxer said that Ms. Fiorina would not help Mr. Cruz in his attempt to g=
ain votes in California=92s June 7 GOP primary, given Ms. Fiorina could not=
 win her Senate race in 2010, a =93year that was a very tough year for Demo=
crats, believe me.=94

=93All I can say is she was rejected,=94 Ms. Boxer said. =93She has run awa=

Ted Cruz, looking for a shake-up in the 2015 race as Donald Trump moves ste=
adily closer to the Republican nomination, on Wednesday announced former GO=
P primary rival Carly Fiorina as his choice for running mate should he win =
the party nod.
The move was immediately dismissed as an act of =93desperation=94 by the Tr=
ump team, but Cruz =96 while acknowledging it is =93unusual=94 to announce =
a running mate so early =96 defended the decision. He claimed =93nobody is =
getting to 1,237 delegates,=94 the number needed to clinch the nomination, =
and voters should =93know what [they] will get.=94
=93After a great deal of time and thought, after a great deal of considerat=
ion and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated to be =
president of the United States that I will run on a ticket with my vice pre=
sidential nominee, Carly Fiorina,=94 Cruz said.
Cruz, together now with Fiorina, was trying to fight Trump's narrative that=
 the race is effectively "over," after the front-runner swept five primary =
states on Tuesday. But Fiorina, in accepting Cruz's offer, said she's ready=
 to "fight."
=93I=92ve had tough fights all my life," Fiorina said. "Tough fights don=92=
t worry me a bit.=94
Cruz made the announcement in the critical primary turf of Indiana, which v=

ounced his decision to cheers and chants of =93Carly! Carly!=94 while touti=

The theoretical pairing represents a diverse ticket =96 offering the possib=

s an individual that I trust and, more important, this is an individual tha=
t you can trust to lead this country, no matter what might happen,=92=94 Cr=
uz said.
But for the time being, Fiorina will hold the odd position of being a vice =
presidential candidate-in-waiting =96 as Cruz continues to lag far behind T=
rump in the battle for the GOP nomination.
Even Fiorina would have to be elected by delegates at the convention. As fo=
r Cruz, he=92s already been mathematically eliminated from clinching the no=
mination before the convention, and is relying on the prospect of a Clevela=
nd floor fight.
A highly visible Cruz surrogate, the former HP CEO recently handed over her=
 tax returns to the Cruz campaign for vetting, CNN reported Tuesday, and he=
r name immediately surfaced when Cruz teased a =93major announcement=94 Wed=
nesday morning.
Cruz said Wednesday that he and his family had grown so close to Fiorina th=

her speech -- and also exchanges texts with the young girls.
=93And Carly may be the first vice president in American history to have an=
 impressive fluency with hearts and smiley face emoticons," Cruz said.

Trump leads Cruz in pledged delegates, 954-562, but Cruz=92s strong ground =
operation has elected many delegate allies to the Republican Convention in =
July. Cruz believes the battle will proceed to a contested convention, wher=
e he hopes to triumph once some pledged delegates become unbound and are fr=
ee to switch their votes.
Trump on Wednesday morning dismissed the notion of Cruz tapping a running m=
ate.
"First of all, he shouldn't be naming anybody because he doesn't even have =
a chance," Trump said. "Naming Carly's dumb, because Carly didn't do well. =
She had one good debate -- not against me by the way, because I had an unbl=
emished record of victories during debates -- but she had one victory on th=
e smaller stage and that was it."
In a statement later Wednesday, Trump criticized the move as Cruz "only try=
ing to stay relevant."
While most presidential candidates domain.com until they have the nomination sewn=

didate in April =96 while he=92s well behind in delegates =96 followed a pa=
ttern of somewhat unconventional campaigning including an early embrace of =
Trump and kicking off his campaign without first forming an exploratory com=

Fiorina began her career working as a secretary and receptionist but quickl=
y rose up the business ranks and was named in 1999 as the chief executive o=
fficer for Hewlett-Packard, becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 c=
ompany.
"Of all the people who didn't make it far in the race, she was one of the b=
est about laying out her plan, talking about who she is and her accomplishm=
ents," said Doug De Groote, a fundraiser for Cruz based near Los Angeles.
On her website, Fiorina describes her tenure at HP as having =93saved 80,00=
0 jobs=94 during =93the worst technology recession in 25 years.=94 But her =
time at the helm also drew criticism for alleged deals with Iran brokered t=
hrough a subsidiary and the laying off of 30,000 employees. In 2004, Fiorin=

Her career as a political candidate began when Fiorina tried to unseat Cali=

"The best way to describe that ticket is mean and meaner," she said. "He wa=

In May 2015, Fiorina announced her candidacy for president and quickly beca=
me known as a feisty critic of Hillary Clinton and a strong defender of the=
 pro-life community. Planned Parenthood immediately panned Fiorina's Wednes=

TED CRUZ NAMES CARLY FIORINA AS RUNNING MATE<<<link>>
-cruz-names-carly-fiorina-as-running-mate/1311836/>

By SCOTT BAUER and STEVE PEOPLES

Republican presidential contender Ted Cruz has tapped former technology exe=
cutive Carly Fiorina to serve as his running mate.

The Texas senator unveiled his pick for vice president Wednesday afternoon =
in Indianapolis, calling her an "extraordinary leader" who has "shattered g=
lass ceilings" in business and politics.

The announcement comes the day after Cruz lost five states to GOP front-run=
ner Donald Trump. The 61-year-old Fiorina previously served as the chief ex=
ecutive of Hewlett-Packard, but has never held elected office. She was the =
only woman in the GOP's crowded presidential field before dropping out of t=
he race earlier in the year.

Cruz says Fiorina excelled in the "hard-scrabble" male-dominated business w=
orld.

"Of all the people who didn't make it far in the race, she was one of the b=
est about laying out her plan, talking about who she is and her accomplishm=
ents," said Doug De Groote, a fundraiser for Cruz based near Los Angeles.

It was an unusual move for a candidate who is far from becoming his party's=
 presumptive nominee, but Cruz is desperate to generate momentum for his st=
ruggling campaign.

Some Cruz allies praised the selection of Fiorina, but privately questioned=
 if it would change the trajectory of the race. Trump has won 77 percent of=
 the delegates he needs to claim the nomination, and a win next week in Ind=
iana will keep him on a firm path to do so.

"Carly has incredible appeal to so many people, especially in California," =
De Groote said. "She can really help him here."

Her first major foray into politics was in 2010, when she ran for Senate in=
 California and lost to incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer by 10 percentage point=
s. She has never held elected office.

Trump criticized a Fiorina pick as "ridiculous" and "dumb" even before it w=
as announced.

"First of all, he shouldn't be naming anybody because he doesn't even have =
a chance," the New York billionaire said in a Wednesday interview on Fox Ne=
ws.

"Naming Carly's dumb, because Carly didn't do well. She had one good debate=
 - not against me by the way, because I had an unblemished record of victor=
ies during debates - but she had one victory on the smaller stage and that =
was it," Trump said.

He added, "She's a nice woman. I think that it's not going to help him at a=
ll."

Throughout her presidential bid, Fiorina emphasized her meteoric rise in th=
e business world. A Stanford University graduate, she started her career as=
 a secretary, earned an MBA and worked her way up at AT&T to become a senio=
r executive at the domain.com leader.

She was also dogged by questions about her record at Hewlett-Packard, where=
 she was hired as CEO in 1999. She was fired six years later, after leading=
 a major merger with Compaq and laying off 30,000 workers.

Democrats quickly attacked the Cruz-Fiorina alliance.

"The best way to describe that ticket is mean and meaner," said Sen. Barbar=
a Boxer, D-Calif., who beat Fiorina for Senate in 2010. "He wants to throw =
people out of the country and she threw thousands of jobs out of the countr=
y. Perfect match."

In an Associated Press-GfK poll conducted in December 2015, Republican vote=
rs were more likely to say they had a favorable than an unfavorable view of=
 Fiorina by a 47 percent to 20 percent margin, with 32 percent unable to gi=
ve a rating.

Among all Americans, 45 percent didn't know enough about Fiorina to rate he=
r, while 22 percent rated her favorably and 32 percent unfavorably.

By contrast, both Cruz and Trump have high negative ratings even within the=
ir own party, according to an April AP-GfK poll. Among Republican voters, 5=
2 percent have a favorable and 41 percent have an unfavorable opinion of Cr=
uz, while 53 percent have a favorable and 46 percent have an unfavorable op=
inion of Trump.

Among all Americans, 59 percent had an unfavorable opinion of Cruz and 69 p=
ercent said that of Trump.
