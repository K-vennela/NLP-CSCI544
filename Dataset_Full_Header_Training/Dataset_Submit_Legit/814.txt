Hi User,

I saw you on MSNBC earlier today, talking about Sanders.  Good stuff!

I imagine you often get requests for TV news interviews, and sometimes
getting to a studio is tough, especially after-hours or on weekends.

So I wanted to tell you about something which may make your life a bit
easier.

StudiGo is a mobile interview studio that can be sent directly to you.
Meaning, you can be interviewed live, from right outside of your home or
office, 24/7. You don't actually need to travel all the way to a downtown
studio.  (And we can put a custom logo/image in the background.)

We've started working with the big channels in DC, and they pay for the
service.  So it's all about your convenience!!!

Pat Buchanan was on Fox yesterday . live from his driveway!!!  This is how
it looked: <<link>> 

So next time, feel free to ask the channel to send the StudiGo to you . if
you don't have the time to make it to them.

Best,

Jon
