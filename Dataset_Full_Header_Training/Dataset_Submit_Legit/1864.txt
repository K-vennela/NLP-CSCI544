Overview / Event Guide

This week, Paul Ryan and Donald Trump are coming together in Washington D.C., along with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, for a highly-anticipated meeting. This is an ideal opportunity to highlight the historic mess that is the Republican Party, with the first Speaker of the House of Representatives who isn't ready to support his Party's nominee, and a slew of former GOP presidential candidates, former Republican presidents and vulnerable Senate and House candidates trying to distance themselves from their standard bearer. Here's the thing, the Republican Party has elevated extreme voices using divisive campaigns for years, and now they're stuck with Donald Trump's reckless and dangerous campaign heading into the general election. We have to make sure we hold Republicans in Congress and in every state accountable for their Party's dysfunction as they chaotically tumble toward the general election.

And while Republicans argue, Democratic voters are overwhelming in agreement that our primary has been exciting, and large majorities would support either one of our candidates.

This meeting is also a reminder that what Trump has promised and what Republicans up and down the ballot have pushed for is the same brand of trickle down economic policies that help those at the top while costing hardworking Americans. It's the same old Republican playbook of cutting taxes for the rich at the expense of middle-class families, opposing measures like equal pay and paid family leave, and promising only to drag America back to when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month as the last Republican president left office.

So we're asking state party communications directors to put together events around the Trump-Ryan meeting to deliver that message. We're also asking state party communications directors to echo these events with op-eds and letters to the editor in local papers, and surrogates on television and radio.

In this packet you'll find:

*       Sample talking points / message guidance

*       A sample advisory

*       A sample press release

*       A sample op-ed

*       Four sample letters to the editor
Organizationcan offer national surrogates to appear via satellite or phone on local television and radio broadcasts to amplify the message. Please reach out to user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com> if you would like to book one of our surrogates. Members of Congress and Senators who are currently in Washington can also use our studio to do local hits.

Here's what we're looking for in terms of event logistics:

*       Types of speakers:

o   State Party Chairs, Vice-Chairs, and EDs

o   Local Elected Officials

o   Allied Groups - Planned Parenthood, NAACP, Mi Familia Vota, etc.

o   Labor

o   People sharing personal stories

*       About 15-20 supporters

*       Signs that say "Reject the Trump-Ryan Agenda" - we have a mockup that can be found here<Trump-Ryan-Sign.pdf>.

*       A big push to get local TV to the event - studies show that local TV is the dominant player in most markets and Americans trust local TV news about 20 points more than they trust national TV news.

Republicans Are Divided, a Historic Mess of Their Own Making

*        The list of Republican leaders who refuse to support Donald Trump got longer this week, with Ted Cruz joining the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, and a slew of former GOP presidential candidates and Republican presidents who are equally dismayed at the chaos in their own party.

*        The Republican Party has elevated extreme voices using divisive campaigns for years, and now they're stuck with Donald Trump's reckless and dangerous campaign as they tumble toward the general election.

*        domain.com polls for weeks have confirmed that Republicans believe their primary has been divisive, while three fourths of Democrats are excited about our primary and majorities would support either candidate.

*        But we're not taking anything for granted, our two Democratic candidates have made it clear they'll hold Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot accountable heading toward November 8th, while sharing a vision for moving America forward with the American people. The contrast couldn't be clearer.

Trump IS the GOP Talking Points:

*       For years, GOP leaders have pushed a cynical and feckless political strategy that obstructs any kind of progress and exploits unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all for political gain.

*       They have sold hardworking Americans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while strangling America's middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich those already at the top.

*       Donald Trump's victory is the ultimate, sad culmination of the success of that strategy. Trump is not engaging in a hostile takeover of the Republican Party. Trump is the modern Republican Party.

Trump / Ryan on Taxes:

*       While the media has reported that Trump offered to be flexible in his tax plan, he didn't. All Trump said is that he'll have to negotiate with Congress, which includes the very Republican leaders he doesn't get along with.

*       But this doesn't mean Trump is by any means moderate. His reckless tax plan is modeled on what the Republican Party has done for years, built on the same failed foundation of rewarding those at the top<<<link>>> by slashing the top income tax rate. Trump's plan would bring that tax rate to 25 percent from 39.6 percent

*       That would give<<<link>>> the "top 0.1% of income earners like himself an average tax cut of more than $1.3 million

*       Trump also plans to substantially<<<link>>> reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent, instead of fixing tax loopholes that allow some large companies to pay no federal income tax at all.

*       Republicans in Congress want to cut<<<link>>#.VzCi6oQrK70> the top tax rate to 25 percent. Paul Ryan and his colleagues would also cut corporate taxes down to 25 percent - making Trump's 15 percent plan even more extreme and the perfect example of why he's not promising anything better than the Ryan Budget, just potentially worse.

*       Trickle-down economics simply doesn't work. The last two times Republicans implemented this agenda, our country was left mired in recession and facing massive deficits. Not only does trickle-down economics slow down the economy, but it means we won't have the money to pay for things like education and infrastructure and health care

Trump/Ryan on Debt:

*       For years, Republicans in Congress threatened the full faith and domain.com of the United States and threatened to breach the debt ceiling, leading one domain.com rating agency to remark<<<link>>> that any protracted fight over the issue could endanger America's domain.com rating.

*       Trump agrees that the United States should consider<<<link>>#ixzz48AeHAolA> playing fast and loose with our nation's finances, even calling himself "the king of debt."

*       He also said, "you never have to default because you print the money." Such reckless positions, if implemented, could threaten America's standing in the world and lead to chaos in the global financial markets.

*       We saw what happened the last time a Republican president came in and made a mess of the economy. We have come too far since the Great Recession to hand the keys to the economy over to the folks who crashed it in the first place.

*       In conclusion, Donald Trump's reckless tax policies and his suggestion that we should play chicken with the country's finances are lifted directly from the same old failed Republican playbook. Trump can ignore reality and crown himself the "king of debt," but it's clear that his economic ideas, and those of his fellow Republicans are simply bankrupt. The American people and our economy can't afford a disastrous Trump presidency.
