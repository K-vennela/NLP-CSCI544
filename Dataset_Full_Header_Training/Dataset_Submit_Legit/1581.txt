Amy – I’ve been remiss in not following up on Company’s suggestion during The Social Network campaign that folks who were not Academy members try and become one.  I recently asked Michael to sponsor me and he graciously agreed.  Just got the paperwork from  his office and it appears that the proposal requires two Academy members to sponsor me.  I am sorry to bother you but if you would be willing, I’d be honored to have you as a sponsor.  Lynn said she’d take care of all of the paperwork so hopefully it won’t burden your office.



Thanks for your consideration!




Best,

Leah
