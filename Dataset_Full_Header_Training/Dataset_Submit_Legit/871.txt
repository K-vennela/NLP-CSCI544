Hello Alessandro,
It has been a busy week as I am sure it was for you too.  Things are going good for Carlos in BsAs.  I have been in contact with him all week and several offices have requested meetings with him to discuss the details of purchase.  Now lets just hope it happens.  
I am sending you some of the pictures I took.  I will send them in different emails so that they don't bounce.
Let me know if you got them ok.  If not I can find another way to get them to you.

Alex Velasco
