Hey squad - over the next few weeks we will be working more closely with the state parties to do some themed events on Trump.

This week we want to hit on the Trump/Ryan meeting. Theme is that despite their personal disagreements, Trump and Ryan share an agenda. We want to hit on taxes & the economy, women's health (throw in a reference to women's health week) and immigration reform. I want to see a lot of references to the "Trump-Ryan Agenda."

Next week we will do a hit on infrastructure week, the week after that we will call for an increase in the minimum wage on the anniversary of the 2015 minimum wage bill - but don't worry about those for now. Just worry about Trump/Ryan.

Per User, we will be sending templates to the state parties TOMORROW with the following items. If your name is next to something, you are responsible for producing it before you leave today.

*         An overview of the issue with talking points (ERIC)

*         An event guide (ERIC)

*         A sample advisory and release focused on taxes, with a short mention of immigration and women's health (TJ)

*         A sample op-ed looping in taxes/economy, women's health and immigration (TOM)

*         Four sample LTEs (SHU-YEN & DESHUNDRA, please write them on taxes/economy. WALTER please write one on immigration. RACHEL please write one on women's health)

However, while we will send these to all state parties - we want to focus on the battleground states, especially the ones that can actually deliver. So think about those.

Please use the messaging below from the Trump narrative and the hit that just went out on Trump. There's also a lot of good stuff in this Greg Sargent piece<<<link>>> from today.

Divisive, Reckless and Dangerous: Donald Trump Lacks the Judgment or Temperament to be President

Donald Trump's recklessness would hurt our economy, diminish our standing in the world, and make our communities less safe. Trump is divisive and dangerous, and he lacks the judgment and temperament to be president.

His impending nomination is a reminder that for years the Republican Party has elevated extreme voices, using divisive campaigns that sought to domain.com unfounded fears for political gain. And just like Republicans in Washington have done for years, Trump is only looking out for himself. His plans would domain.com those at the very top and economists have predicted that his policies could cause a global recession. He would drag our country back to where we were when the last Republican president left office, when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. The American people can't afford to let him bully his way into the Oval Office.

Trump has already damaged America's relationships across the globe. His record of denigrating women has only gotten worse throughout this campaign, at the same time that his divisive rhetoric has made our communities less safe. And his business record is riddled with embarrassing failures that make it clear the American people can't afford to let him get anywhere near the White House.

National Security: Even as a candidate, Donald Trump has damaged America's relationships across the globe. In the White House, he would undeniably make America less safe.

*         Donald Trump has no foreign policy experience and rather than seeking the advice of well-respected experts, Trump relies on his own misinformed ideas and in his own words, on his "good brain."

*         Trump has falsely claimed that he knows "more about ISIS than the generals" and recommended that the U.S. military domain.com international war crimes.

*         Trump's threat to pull back from our most important military alliances<<<link>>> like NATO, pull aid from our allies like Israel, and his gushing praise for dictators would put our country on a dangerous path.

*         Trump has refused to rule out using nuclear weapons on European territory, and wants to allow countries that don't currently have nuclear weapons to get them, reversing long-held goals of international nuclear disarmament.

Wrong on Women: Donald Trump has a decades-long record of denigrating women and promoting misogyny. His policies would make it harder for women to make their own choices when it comes to their healthcare or their career.

*         Trump once said you had to  treat women "like s**t" and has spent decades doing so himself by calling women names - "fat pig," "slob," or "bimbo" - and saying a man needs a woman to support him at home rather than always be "griping and bitching."

*         Trump would take away a woman's right to make her own healthcare choices and has said women who had abortions should be punished - but not the doctors that performed them - and opposed exceptions for health of the mother because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to have an abortion.

*         Trump thinks ensuring equal pay for women should just be left up to "the marketplace" and once suggested family leave policies should actually be scaled back and noted pregnancy was "an inconvenience for a business." Trump complained that when he employed mothers, they were not giving him "100 percent."

Divisive and Dangerous: Donald Trump exploited racial anxieties and cultural fears in the domain.com of getting elected - to the point where his rallies have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the media.

*         Trump spouts hateful and dangerous lies about Muslims and called to surveil mosques, to ban Muslims from entering the country and to create a database of all Muslims in America - including U.S. citizens - and could not answer when pressed on how this would be any different from Nazi Germany.

*         Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" and criminals and said they brought disease into the country, said you needed to check if Native Americans were "real Indians," and claimed that a "well-educated black has a tremendous advantage" - but apparently not an advantage in finding housing in Trump properties, because in the 1970s, the Trump Organization was sued for discriminating against Blacks and Puerto Ricans.

*         Trump has been endorsed by former  KKK leader David Duke, and his candidacy has been used as a recruiting tool for the white supremacist movement, which is no surprise since Trump refused to disavow David Duke and the KKK four times in one interview.

*         Trump has fostered violence against protestors at his rallies, suggesting that a Black Lives Matter protester maybe "should have been roughed up," promising to pay the legal fees if someone would "knock the hell" out of a protester and reminiscing about the old days when a protester would be "carried off on a stretcher."

*         Trump repeatedly threatened the First Amendment by calling to "open up" libel laws so he could sue reporters whenever they printed a story he did not like, made it a practice of banning media outlets he did not like from covering his rallies, and thought "closing" parts of the domain.com was a rational strategy to combat ISIS.

Reckless on the Economy, Making Millions at the Expense of Hardworking Americans: Though he plays the part of a wealthy and successful businessman, Donald Trump's real life record is a reminder that he would endanger the entire global financial system and promote policies that hurt everyday Americans.

*         Despite his tough talk on trade deals and the loss of American jobs, Donald Trump manufactured his clothing line in countries he rails against, like China and Mexico - a reminder that he made millions at the expense of American workers and on the backs of foreign labor.

*         His Trump "University" fleeced thousands of Americans simply looking to get ahead.

*         Trump's businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt, leaving investors, contractors and small businesses holding the bag for his bad business decisions.

*         Trump's unfounded predictions<<<link>>> of recession under President Obama and warnings against investing in the stock market are reckless.

*         Economists have actually predicted Trump's policies could start an international trade war and even destabilize the global economy<<<link>>>.

*         Trump's tax plan would overwhelmingly domain.com the rich while costing the country $9.5 trillion to implement -- more than any other Republican plan proposed. It also violates his pledge to eliminate the national debt.

*         Trump actually said at one of the Republican Party's debates that wages were "too high" and opposed raising the federal minimum wage

*         Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would jeopardize health care for 20 million Americans who've been able to get coverage under Obamacare.

Republicans couldn't unite against him and failed to stand up to him during their primary because they were playing to the same extreme base of their party. Democrats will be united and hold Donald Trump accountable every day until November 8th.

The "King of Debt," Donald Trump and the GOP on the Economy

In less than a week since becoming the GOP's presumptive nominee, Donald Trump has already exposed himself as reckless and dangerous on the American economy. His comments over the last few days promise to undermine  the role of the United States as a major economic power and potentially threaten the global financial system. While his stances mimic those of Republicans in Congress, they often go further and are more irresponsible than those of his counterparts in the House and Senate.

On Taxes, Trump Can't Hide from GOP's Obsession with Trickle Down Economics - Yesterday, Trump tried to dismiss concerns about his reckless tax plan, which would reward those at the top<<<link>>> by slashing the top income tax rate to 25 percent from 39.6 percent, claiming that "the rich" are "probably going to end up paying more." In reality, such a move would give<<<link>>> the "top 0.1% of income earners like himself an average tax cut of more than $1.3 million (versus $2,700 for those in the middle class)." And just this morning, Trump once again confirmed<<<link>>> that he would, in fact, lower taxes on the wealthiest of Americans. Trump also plans to substantially<<<link>>> reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, even beyond the reckless plan put forth by Republican Speaker Paul Ryan.

Trump's plans are just like the proposal put forth by Republicans in Congress who want to cut<<<link>>#.VzCi6oQrK70> the top tax rate to 25 percent. Paul Ryan and his colleagues would also cut corporate taxes down to 25 percent - but Trump wants to go even further, down to 15 percent. There's a name for this: Trickle Down Economics. And it doesn't work. Just ask the last two Republican Administrations, which both left our country mired in recession and facing massive deficits.

On America's Debt: A Page Out of the GOP Playbook - This morning, Trump doubled down on his statements that the United States should consider<<<link>>#ixzz48AeHAolA> playing fast and loose with our nation's finances, even calling himself "the king of debt." He also said, "this is the United States government. First of all, you never have to default because you print the money." Such reckless positions, if implemented, could threaten America's standing in the world and lead to chaos in the financial markets.

This is the same sort of behavior that Republicans in Congress undertook when they played politics last year with the debt ceiling (this was not the first time), leading one domain.com rating agency to remark<<<link>>> that any protracted fight over the issue could endanger America's domain.com rating.

"Donald Trump's reckless tax policies and his suggestion that we should play chicken with the country's finances are lifted directly from the same old failed Republican playbook. Trump can ignore reality and crown himself the king of debt, but it's clear that his economic ideas, and those of his fellow Republicans are simply bankrupt. The American people and our economy can't afford a disastrous Trump presidency."  - OrganizationNational Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach
