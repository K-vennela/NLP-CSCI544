Additional notes

Anthony Scaramucci on Fox News

Public financing?

-       Obama didn't take it in 2015 

-       Under $200 million

-       "It is not enough money, not enough rocket fuel to get you to the presidency."

Only need $500 million?

-       Trump's stated goal in $1 billion.

-       Only needs $500 million because he has universal name recognition

-       Just needs money for ground operation, etc

Tax Returns breaking with tradition?

-       Billionaire running is an "unusual circumstance"

-       First entrepreneur to go straight into White House

-       First since Eisenhower with no political experience

-          Returns are "super complicated"

What doesn't he want people to see?

-          Complicated returns, under domain.com

-          Doesn't want to open them up to opposition research poking holes

-          Wants to focus instead on creating middle-class jobs

-          Non-material issue to the campaign

-          Optional. Clearly not a legal issue, because IRS would do something
