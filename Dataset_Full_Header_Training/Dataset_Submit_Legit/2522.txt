POLITICO
By Hadas Gold

Back in February<<<link>>
ers-hillary-clinton-debates-michigan-california-218691> the Hillary Clinton=
 and Bernie Sanders campaigns agreed to extend the Democratic debate domain.com=
le by four more debates.

Three have been held, but the final debate, to be held in California in May=
 according to the agreement, doesn't seem to be going anywhere fast. There =
are 19 days left in May, and the California primary is on June 7.

At the moment there have been few if any discussions about a date, location=
, or network agreed upon between the campaigns and the Democratic National =
Committee, multiple sources said.

The Sanders campaign has not been in negotiations with the Clinton campaign=
 or the DNC, and is waiting for a cable network to come forward to offer a =
location and a primetime slot, a Sanders adviser said on background. Spokes=
man Michael Briggs said they're trying to 'nail down a date and location' b=
ut would only say that there 'have been discussions' when asked for specifi=
cs.

The last Democratic debate<<<link>>
cepts-april-14-debate-with-clinton-221556>, hosted by CNN in Brooklyn, came=
 together just ten days before through a rather public negotiation, which t=
he Sanders adviser said they expect to happen again. All three cable networ=
ks have expressed interest, the adviser said, but none have specifically co=
me forward with a time or place. (Cable networks this season have been spen=
ding tidy sums to reserve locations on different dates and in different cit=
ies that could be used for possible debates or town halls). The Sanders cam=
paign has often gone around the Organizationin debate negotiations, and even sought=
 to exclude<<<link>>
-results/2016/04/bernie-sanders-dnc-democratic-debate-221616> the Organizationfrom =
the Brooklyn debate last month.

"As voters in the remaining states and territories make up their minds abou=
t the future of the Democratic Party, I believe they deserve a chance to co=
mpare my record and Secretary Clinton's record on creating jobs, raising th=
e minimum wage, war and peace, the need for health care for all, breaking u=
p big banks, combating climate change and other critical issues. Secretary =
Clinton's campaign already has agreed to another debate in California. I ho=
pe that we can soon settle on a date and place for that debate," Sanders sa=
id on Tuesday night after winning the West Virginia primary.

Asked about the negotiations for an upcoming debate or whether one is still=
 in the works, Organizationspokesman User said there was 'no update at this=
 time."

A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment.
