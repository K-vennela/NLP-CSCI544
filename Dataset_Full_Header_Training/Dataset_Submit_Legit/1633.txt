HI all - We'll send this to Factivists tomorrow. Thanks!

Subject: The Breakfast Club

Hey there, NAME -
Remember that classic '80s movie where high school kids from all different walks of life come together over weekend detention and realize they're not so different after all? Well, Speaker Paul Ryan and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for president, Donald Trump, spent some time together on Thursday morning and realized there is plenty they have in common.

In fact, they issued a statement (just like The Breakfast Club's assignment!) saying how crucial it was that "Republicans unite around our shared principles, advance a conservative agenda, and do all we can to win this fall," and "while we recognize our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground" and ultimately "remain confident there's a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall."
Yes, the Republican Party is unifying around a candidate who has stoked hatred and intolerance so much, some of his biggest fans are white nationalists:

Whose approval rating among women is historically low - with good reason:

And who is at odds with our most fundamental American values:

But really, it shouldn't surprise Speaker Ryan - or anyone else, for that matter - that he should be able to find common ground with Donald Trump. After all, Trump's candidacy has given the Republican Party what they've been asking for after years of sowing seeds of fear, hatred, greed, and intolerance:

The stakes have never been higher for electing Democrats this November, NAME. Especially when the Republican nominee is as resistant to facts and fact-checking as Trump is, your job is more important than ever to get the word out to your family, friends, and neighbors on what a disaster Trump - and the rest of his Republican Party - would be for our country, so tweet, share, and forward this email to everyone you can.

Thanks for your help, and talk soon!
