Talking about appropriation bills here, but this also could work quite nicely with SCOTUS...

McConnell: "We are going to give the Senate every opportunity to do the basic work of government this year. But some have said that because it is an election year you can't do much. I'd like to remind everyone we've had a regularly scheduled election in this country every two years since 1788. Right on time. And people have said we can't do it because we have an election next year, people say we can't do whatever it is because we have an election this year. We have elections in this country right on time and it's not an excuse not to do our work."
