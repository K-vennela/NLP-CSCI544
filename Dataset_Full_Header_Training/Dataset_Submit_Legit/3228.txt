The flier is attached.

The research resume drop will be Wednesday May 4th from 5 - 7 pm, here at the DNC.

The flier asks that people who would like to attend, domain.com their resume by 4/30 but we'll extend that deadline though this evening. We'd like to provide security a good list and manage the flow of this thing so it's important that people RSVP to user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>
