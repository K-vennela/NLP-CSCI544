RECENT NEWS\

*         Legislation to restore a presidential primary<<<link>>> in Colorado passed its first committee hurdle Monday, as lawmakers race to get it done by the end of the session May 11. House Bill 1454 would allow every voter - even those registered as unaffiliated with a party - to cast a mail ballot in a presidential primary in 2020. Coloradans would have their first presidential primary since 2000, before the state returned to the caucus system in 2004. Under the bill, unaffiliated voters would pick which party's ballot they wish to receive, then that temporary affiliation would go away 30 days after the vote. The measure maintains the current caucus system to select delegates to the national conventions for both parties.

*         The Colorado Supreme Court will not hear the case<<<link>>> of a Lakewood baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. That decision effectively upholds a ruling by the Colorado Court of Appeals that found Masterpiece Cake shop owner Jack Phillips cannot cite his religious beliefs or free-speech rights in refusing to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. Phillips' attorneys, who asked the state's high court to hear the case, said they are "evaluating all legal options."

*         Former GOP State Rep. Jon Keyser did not qualify for the Republican Senate primary<<<link>>> in Colorado, prompting Keyser's campaign to announce that it would take legal action to get him on the ballot. Keyser fell 86 signatures short in the state's 3rd district, according to the secretary of state.

*         Republican Rep. Mike Pompeo<<<link>>#storylink=cpy> has decided against mounting a bid to challenge Kansas' incumbent Sen. Jerry Moran and will instead seek to retain his seat in the U.S. House.

*         A federal judge upheld North Carolina's voter ID law on Monday. In a 485 page ruling, U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder, a George W. Bush appointee, upheld the voter ID portion<<<link>>>, as well as portions of the 2015 law that reduced the number of days people could vote early, eliminated same-day registration and voting, and prohibited people from casting a ballot outside their precinct.

*         The city of Cleveland, Ohio will pay $6 million to settle a domain.com<<<link>>> filed by the relatives of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy shot and killed by a police officer in 2014, according to a settlement announced Monday.

*         The Austin, Texas school district decided last month to rename Robert E. Lee Elementary School<<<link>>>, and opened the nominating process up to the public. In the end, 228 names were suggested; Donald Trump got the most nods, with 45. ("Robert E. Lee" came in second.)

ELECTION CLIPS

2016 - Presidential

Democratic Party Candidates

Bernie Sanders
Bernie Sanders's Supporters Consider Where to Turn if His Bid Fails<<<link>>>

Bernie Sanders<<<link>>> lost New York's primary by a double-domain.com margin. Polls suggest his delegate gap with Hillary Clinton is likely to widen after five states vote on Tuesday. And Mrs. Clinton is increasingly turning her fire on Donald J. Trump<<<link>>>, confident that she will soon lock down the Democratic nomination. Still, Mr. Sanders's supporters turn out, eager to hear his message but increasingly cognizant that their candidate's political chances are fading quickly by the day. "I hate to say it, but I feel like I'm putting my head in a bag and just crossing my fingers," said Jessie Burnett, 39, a mother of three who lives in Tolland, Conn. "I'm throwing my full support behind him until he says he is out," she said, calling his chance of winning the Democratic nomination "terrible." The increasing frequency of questions about whether and when Mr. Sanders might concede to Mrs. Clinton - or at least tone down his attacks on her - frustrates not only the senator but also many of his fans. As enthusiastic as ever, Mr. Sanders repeatedly tells packed crowds that they should encourage family and friends to cast votes for him and that his "political revolution" counts on their ability to get others involved.

Republican Party Candidates

Ted Cruz

Ted Cruz-John Kasich Alliance Against Donald Trump Quickly Weakens<<<link>>>

The temporary alliance<<<link>>> between Senator Ted Cruz<<<link>>> and Gov. John Kasich<<<link>>> of Ohio, formed to deny Donald J. Trump<<<link>>> the Republican presidential nomination, was already fraying almost to the point of irrelevance on Monday, only hours after it was announced to great fanfare. With the pact, the two candidates agreed to cede forthcoming primary contests to each other. Mr. Kasich would, most crucially, stand down in Indiana's primary on May 3 to give Mr. Cruz a better chance to defeat Mr. Trump there, while Mr. Cruz would leave Oregon and New Mexico to Mr. Kasich. It appeared to be a measure of last resort, but initially it seemed like a breakthrough.  Mr. Cruz trumpeted what he called the "big news" in Indiana, a state that appears pivotal to stopping Mr. Trump from winning a majority of delegates. "John Kasich has decided to pull out of Indiana to give us a head-to-head contest with Donald Trump," he said. But at his own campaign stop in Philadelphia on Monday, Mr. Kasich tamped down Mr. Cruz's triumphalism. Voters in Indiana, Mr. Kasich said, "ought to vote for me," even if he would not be campaigning publicly there. He added, "I don't see this as any big deal." Under the best of circumstances, the arrangement between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich would seem to be a long shot - more of an expedient to stop Mr. Trump from taking a big step toward winning the nomination next week in Indiana than a permanent joining of forces.

Donald Trump

Pennsylvania's wild card delegates could make or break Donald Trump<<<link>>>
Donald Trump is expected to win Tuesday's Pennsylvania Republican primary in a landslide, but the size of his all-important delegate haul figures to be a mystery that could stretch all the way to the convention floor in Cleveland this summer. Leading most Pennsylvania polls by double-digits, the billionaire is a near lock to carry the 17 delegates awarded to the winner of the statewide vote. But the process is more complicated for the remaining 54. That's because they are essentially elected on the honor system. Voters first select their preferred candidate -- that's the state-wide vote. Then, voters in each of the 18 congressional districts pick three delegates for the convention. Many of those delegates have pledged their support to Trump, Ted Cruz or John Kasich, but the catch is that they are technically unbound and beholden to nobody -- not the voters, candidates or Republican Party.

2016 - Senate

California

Kamala Harris in driver's seat at California's first U.S. Senate debate<<<link>>>

The first debate in California's sleepy U.S. Senate campaign seemed to present a question: Who has the best chance of securing the second and final spot on the November ballot, alongside Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris? Because Harris ended the evening where she started - firmly still in the driver's seat. Harris and Rep. Loretta Sanchez, both Democrats, have the best chance at making it past the state's top-two June 7 primary to face each other in a general election. The Republican hopefuls used Monday's debate to attempt to sully Sanchez's record more than go after Harris, who leads all public opinion polls and had nearly $5 million in the bank at the start of this month. The Orange County congresswoman was pressed by George "Duf" Sundheim about missing a slew of House Homeland Security Committee meetings in 2015. Moderators kept Sanchez on the defensive, asking about past remarks about native Americans, the Vietnamese and regarding the number of Muslims supporting a strict Islamist state. She adamantly denied she was anti-Muslim and dismissed the comments as being taken "out of context," while also saying no one had refuted her claim.

Colorado

Jon Keyser falls short in effort to make Colorado Senate primary ballot<<<link>>>

State officials said Monday that U.S. Senate candidate Jon Keyser failed to collect enough signatures to earn a place on the June 28 primary ballot - a stunning blow that threatens to sink a campaign once hyped as the best in the Republican field. Under state rules, Senate candidates who choose to petition their way onto the ballot must gather signatures from 1,500 or more voters in each of Colorado's seven congressional districts - at least 10,500 in all. Keyser fell short by 86 signatures in Colorado's 3rd District, according to the Colorado secretary of state's office, which reviewed his petition. The 3rd District is one of the state's largest and comprises most of western Colorado. Keyser's campaign plans to protest the decision and has five days to do so. The 16,067 signatures he submitted overall allowed him to clear the threshold in the six other districts.

Florida

Florida Senate Candidate says it's not safe to allow 'anybody from the Middle East' into U.S<<<link>>>

Donald Trump suggested banning all Muslims from entering the U.S. The U.S. House voted to restrict travelers who have visited Iraq. Now, a Florida candidate for U.S. Senate wants to ban anyone from a Middle Eastern country, except Israel, from entering the United States. During the question-and-answer session that followed a speech to the Broward County<<<link>>> Republican Party on Monday night, Carlos Beruff was asked by someone in the audience about his "position on Muslim immigration." "Ah ha," he said. "I think our immigration department is broken. And I don't think it's safe to allow anybody from the Middle East into this country." Most of the audience of about 200 Republicans gathered at Deicke Auditorium in Plantation erupted in applause and some cheers. When the response died down, Beruff added, "until they fix it."

David Jolly, Alan Grayson square off in Florida's first Senate debate<<<link>>>
The field to replace Marco Rubio in the Senate is a crowded one, but you wouldn't know it from the campaign's first debate Monday night. Two of the seven candidates for the open seat - U.S. reps. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, and David Jolly, R-Indian Shores- faced off in Orlando, debating economics, abortion, the environment and campaign finance. The time spent on campaign finance allowed both candidates to highlight centerpieces of their campaigns. Jolly has been riding a wave of good publicity for 48 hours following a 60 Minutes report Sunday on legislation he proposed called the "Stop Act." It would ban federal elected officials from personally asking for money. This weekend's broadcast showed images of members of Congress dialing for contributions in what Jolly called "sweatshop phone booths."

Indiana

Poll: Young up big in Indiana's U.S. Senate race<<<link>>>

Todd Young leads Marlin Stutzman by double digits in the Republican U.S. Senate primary, according to polling results released Monday. The poll, conducted for WTHR-13<<<link>>> and Howey Politics<<<link>>>, has U.S. Rep. Young ahead 43 percent to 31 percent over his congressional counterpart, but about quarter of the likely primary electorate - 26 percent - remains undecided. See a detailed breakdown of polling results here<<<link>>>. Young also would fare better in a general election against Democrat Baron Hill, according to the poll, lending credence to his campaign claim that he is the more electable of the two. In a debate earlier this month, Young repeatedly noted that he had already defeated former Rep. Hill in a prior run for Congress.

Kansas

Pompeo won't challenge Moran in Kansas Senate race, but exits with blistering criticism of the incumbent<<<link>>>
Rep. Mike Pompeo said Monday he won't challenge Sen. Jerry Moran in a Republican Senate primary in Kansas - then took several nasty and barely-disguised swipes at Moran in a lengthy statement to supporters. Pompeo, a Republican from Wichita, said there isn't enough time to run an effective Senate campaign this year. "The window for our kind of campaign is closed," he wrote. But there are several apparent references to Moran in Pompeo's statement. "It is ... absurd to defend one's record in the Senate by telling constituents how many town halls you've held," Pompeo's statement said. "It's the difference between motion and progress. Listening lacks value if no actions follow." Pompeo said he considered a race because Moran said he might consider Merrick Garland for the U.S. Supreme Court, a statement Moran quickly withdrew. Pompeo: "As I watched this waffling up close, I began to contemplate a Senate run."

Maryland

Identity Trumps Ideology in Maryland Senate Race<<<link>>>
At first glance, the Democratic primary for a US Senate seat in Maryland looks eerily similar to the party's national contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. On one side, there's an establishment candidate, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, who has been in politics since the early 1990s, defines progressivism by legislation passed rather than promises made, and touts wonky policy papers and bills on the campaign trail. On the other, there's a challenger from the left, Rep. Donna Edwards, who appeals to a national progressive audience with big-picture rhetoric rather than nitty-gritty deal-making. But this contest doesn't align neatly with the narrative of the Clinton-Sanders face-off. Rather than a clash of ideologies, the Maryland race has become partly a battle of identity politics. Van Hollen is a white guy, and Edwards is an African American woman. And if Van Hollen wins, the takeaway might be that this element of the race trumped the ideological component. The contest has been close, although Van Hollen seems to have built a lead in the final stretch, according to polls. If Tuesday's vote bears out those surveys, it will fulfill the long-expected script for the race.

Nevada

Keyser booted from Senate ballot, vows domain.com<<<link>>>
"Republican Jon Keyser did not qualify for the Republican Senate primary in Colorado, the state's chief elections officer said Monday, prompting Keyser's campaign to announce that it would take legal action to get him on the ballot. 'We are confident that we secured the necessary number of signatures to appear on the ballot,' Keyser spokesman Matt Connelly said. 'We will be pursuing legal action to ensure thousands of Coloradans are not disenfranchised.' Colorado Senate candidates are required to gather 1,500 valid signatures from each of the state's seven congressional districts to qualify for the primary ballot. Keyser fell short in the state's vast 3rd District, according to the secretary of state.

Pennsylvania

The High-Stakes Senate Primary in Pennsylvania<<<link>>>
The Pennsylvania Senate primary isn't just about the Democratic Party choosing the best steward of its values to represent the people in Washington. Neither are the high-profile endorsements that have come with the race, nor the glaring spotlight trained on towns from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. Rather, national Democrats see Pennsylvania as key to achieving an increasingly feasible goal: taking back the Senate. And they're virtually united in their support of candidate Katie McGinty to beat Republican Senator Pat Toomey in the fall. McGinty, who last worked as chief of staff to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, is in a neck-and-neck contest with former Democratic congressman Joe Sestak. The dynamic of the front-runner race is a familiar one this election year, with an establishment candidate, McGinty, taking on an independent-minded outsider, Sestak. A recent Franklin & Marshall poll<<<link>>> showed Sestak leading McGinty by six points, but with a large enough margin of error-and enough undecided voters-to keep the scene interesting.

2016 - Governors

Montana

Money Floods Into Montana Campaigns<<<link>>>
The two major candidates for governor are on pace to set state spending records in Montana's marquee political contest, while the bid for the state's lone congressional seat is also shaping up to be one of the most expensive in Montana House-race history. Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock's fundraising skills were on full display as he reported collecting nearly $160,000 during the past month in his bid for re-election, according to campaign finance reports for the period covering Feb. 26 through March 27. GOP rival Greg Gianforte reported raising about $112,000 during the same period, according to reports filed with the state's Commissioner of Political Practices.

North Carolina

Pat McCrory campaign targets Jennifer Roberts over HB2<<<link>>>
A former Charlotte mayor is targeting the current mayor - in his gubernatorial campaign. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory's campaign released an email Monday blaming Mayor Jennifer Roberts Roberts, a Democrat, for backing the ordinance that prompted House Bill 2. The email takes a swipe at McCrory's Democratic opponent Roy Cooper as well as Roberts. "Roy Cooper Ally Jennifer Roberts Admitted She Thought About Leaving Out The Bathroom Mandate, But Pushed It Through Anyway," a headline says. In January, Roberts backed a city council ordinance that extended anti-discrimination protection to the LGBT community and allowed transgender people to use the bathroom with which they identify.

Utah

Jonathan Johnson forces primary for Utah governor race, but can he defeat Gov. Gary Herbert?<<<link>>>

Jonathan Johnson's campaign manager had a hunch things might go his candidate's way against Gov. Gary Herbert at the state Republican convention Saturday because there weren't enough cowboy hats. Team Herbert had been handing out white cowboy hats at his convention booth to supporters, but as Dave Hansen scanned the crowd, he wasn't seeing as many wide brims as he would have expected. Johnson surprised many - hammering Herbert for raising taxes, gathering signatures to get on the ballot rather than just going to the party convention, and accusing the governor of turning over control of Utah schools to the federal government - and riding that message to a 55-45 percent victory among the GOP delegates. Hansen said there is no doubt that the convention win gives Johnson momentum heading into the eight-week sprint to the June 28 primary. "I think he has shown that he can win and that's what a lot of voters wondered, 'We like what he says, but can he actually win?' And he showed it at convention that he can," Hansen said Monday.
