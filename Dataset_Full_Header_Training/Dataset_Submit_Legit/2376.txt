Subject: RE: Interview Request from KNX/CBS Newsradio Los Angeles

Hello again Walter,

Is there a chance that we could get Debbie Wasserman Schultz today, for an interview about delegate counts, super-delegates, etc., as the Clinton/Sanders contest seems to be getting closer?  KNX program director Ken Charles suggested that we try to reach her - I think she knows him because he was in Florida for many years.

I'm hoping to get her on the air at 4:35pm Eastern time today, for about 5 minutes, with the hosts of KNX In-Depth, Charles Feldman and Chris Sedens.

Please let me know if she can do this interview.

Thank you very much!
