Excerpts below, User. Let me know if I=92m good to blast, and I=92ll do so =
right now (to our National and Alaska lists). Otherwise, I can hold until t=
he AM.

Prepared Remarks for Delivery: OrganizationChair Rep. Wasserman Schultz at Alaska S=
tate Convention

ANCHORAGE -- Tonight, OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz addressed the=
 Alaska State Convention. Below you will find excerpts as prepared for deli=
very:

=93As chair of the DNC, I=92ve committed myself to getting to know my fello=
w Democrats with visits to all fifty states =96 and I=92ll be honest, it=92=
s been a little easier to reach those lower forty-eight.

=85

=93But I know I=92m not the only one here tonight who travelled a great dis=
tance to be at the convention =96 I understand there are even as many as 40=
 high school students coming all the way from Juneau, and who registered to=
 be delegates =96 let=92s give them a hand for being the future of our part=
y.
=93And let me just thank everyone else here who has travelled from across o=
ur country=92s largest state to show your support.
=93Your enthusiasm, energy, your commitment, and your dedication to our par=
ty will make all the difference on Election Day.

=85

=93Here in Alaska the Organizationhelps fund direct mail campaigns to reach voters =
and help get them to the polls on Election Day.
=93We fund salaries for critical staff under our state party partnerships. =
In fact, Kay Brown can tell you, she was one of the first State Party Partn=
ership employees we ever hired.

=93Since 2009, the Organizationhas directly provided the Alaska Democratic Party mo=
re than $625,000 in direct support.
=93But it=92s not just the funding -- the Organizationhas been out-pacing the GOP i=
n how we offer direct support to our state parties with training, and bench=
-building; we share our deep research and communications capabilities in Al=
aska and across the country.

=85

=93But of course, our number one advantage comes from our candidates, and t=
he contrast they=92re offering Alaska voters and the American people.
=93I couldn=92t be more proud of the two candidates at the top of our ticke=
t.

=93From Day One, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have been running smart=
, substantive campaigns focused on the issues that matter.

=93We=92ve watched them engage honestly with voters, answer thoughtfully at=
 town halls and debates, and deliver an aspirational message that speaks to=
 the hopes and dreams of the American people=85

=93And no matter which one of our candidates becomes the nominee, we will b=
e united coming out of our convention and headed toward Election Day.

=93In the words of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders =91Trum=
p will not be president.=92

=85

=93I=92m inspired here tonight =96 I wish everyone could see how much dedic=
ation the Democrats of Alaska have.
=93Don=92t believe for a second that just because the pundits like to paint=
 Alaska red and say it isn=92t a battleground state means you=92re sideline=
d.

=93In every presidential election since 2000, the percentage of Alaskans ca=
sting their vote for the Democrat has increased =96 from 27% in 2015 to mor=
e than 40% in 2012.
=93This has already been an exciting election year nationally =96 working t=
ogether, I know we can Dump Trump and, eventually turn Alaska Blue.
=93I know we can count on you to keep working hard throughout this election=
.
=93So thank you for all you=92ve done to support our party, and thank you f=
or everything you will do to bring us all the way to victory in November.
=93Now on to victory! Thank you, Alaska Democrats!=94
