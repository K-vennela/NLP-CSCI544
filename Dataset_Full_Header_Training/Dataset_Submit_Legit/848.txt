Actually, no we shouldn't have.  That is not how negotiations work.  At least, not if you are negotiating in good faith, which we were.

We can discuss press strategy.  But since most on this chain do not have the background or details, using email to debate or defend or advance a strategy is both inefficient and lacks context.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss.

Adding the Chair and Mark, Sanders camp are sending a release about the letter Jeff sent to the chairwoman about the committee appointments. No chance to respond. Ken Thomas at AP has a story he is going to hit send on then Sanders sending his release.

We should've gone first.

I know things are swirling.
I am engaged in shuttle diplomacy with all parties right now ... will keep you posted if further action is needed.
Let me know if you have questions.
