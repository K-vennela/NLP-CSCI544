Smith Statement on Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act

Washington D.C. (Link<<<link>>
es/smith-statement-on-combating-terrorist-recruitment-act>) - Congressman A=
dam Smith made the following statement regarding his opposition to the Comb=
ating Terrorist Recruitment Act:

"Terrorism is about spreading fear. As we combat violent extremism and the =
spread of dangerous propaganda, we must recognize that hateful ideology ori=
ginates both overseas and at home. Since the 9/11 attacks, domestic terrori=
sts have killed more people in the United States than foreign terrorist org=
anizations. Numerous domestic terror acts, including those at the Seattle J=
ewish Federation, Planned Parenthood in Colorado, Oklahoma City, the Emanue=
l AME Church in Charleston, the Sikh Temple in Wisconsin and the Holocaust =
Museum in Washington, DC, have made clear that violent extremism is not lim=
ited to a single ideology, nor does it always breed on foreign soil.

"Earlier this week, the House of Representatives considered H.R. 4820, the =
Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act. Notably, this bill weakens national se=
curity by excluding domestic terror organizations from its focus and ignori=
ng that terrorists are inspired by a broad number of religious, political a=
nd ideological beliefs.

"Our national security approach must build people-to-people ties, address t=
he root causes of extremism and empower local partners to prevent violent e=
xtremism, both here and abroad. In the Puget Sound region, we have seen the=
 damage that hateful and violent rhetoric inflicts on our local community c=
enters and places of worship. We must remain vigilant in our fight against =
terror networks that seek to do us harm. By opening our eyes to the realiti=
es of foreign and domestic terror networks, we can work together to build a=
 more just and peaceful society as we keep America safe."
