OrganizationChair Statement in Honor of Cinco de Mayo

Washington, D.C - OrganizationChair Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the following=
 statement today in honor of Cinco de Mayo:

"Cinco de Mayo is a special day in Mexican history - a day that commemorate=
s what can be best described as an improbable victory. On May 5, 1862, Mexi=
can fighters and workers decided to take a stand and defend themselves from=
 the mighty French Army despite being both out-manned and out-armed. The od=
ds were clearly against them, but it was the hope of creating a better life=
 for themselves and their children that fueled them and that ultimately all=
owed them to emerge victorious at the Battle of Puebla.

"More than 150 years later, that domain.com of resilience and determination ver=
y much lives on among the millions of Mexican Americans in our country. Sim=
ply put, they've made immense contributions in politics, education, medicin=
e, engineering, sports, food, and military service, and in so doing, our tw=
o cultures have grown closer than ever. And so, as we celebrate this import=
ant day that brings both sides of the border together, I would like to make=
 one thing crystal clear: we, the Democratic Party, are proud to stand with=
 Mexican Americans and all others from coast-to-coast who want nothing but =
the chance to live the American dream and bring to fruition a brighter futu=
re. We celebrate our diversity, for it has made us a richer and more vibran=
t place.

"This, of course, stands in stark contrast with what we have heard time and=
 again from the official Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Let us not forge=
t that he kicked off his campaign by calling Mexicans 'rapists' and 'drug d=
ealers,' that he has promised to tear families apart and deport 11.3 millio=
n undocumented immigrants, and that he has promised to get rid of President=
 Obama's executive orders on immigration, known as DACA and DAPA. That is f=
undamentally un-American, and it runs counter to the values that have made =
America great for so long. End of story."

Cinco de Mayo marks a singular moment in Mexican history.  Nearly 150 years=
 ago, a ragtag band of soldiers and citizens, badly outnumbered and facing =
impossible odds, held their ground on a muddy hill to defend their nation f=
rom what was at the time the most fearsome fighting force in the world.  Th=
at decisive victory at what became known as the Battle of Puebla ignited a =
pride in country and culture that Mexican Americans feel to this day.

And tomorrow, on both sides of our border, we'll pay tribute to our shared =
heritage by celebrating with friends and family, with love and laughter.  W=
e'll remember that America is a richer and more vibrant place thanks to the=
 contributions of Mexican Americans -- (applause) -

... We'll remember that the contributions of commerce and culture, in langu=
age and literature, in faith, and in food have all made America a better pl=
ace.  And we will honor the service of Mexican Americans who have worn the =
uniform of the United States.  We'll also domain.com to advancing the ambitio=

-reception

Now, the events of this date in history are well-known -- how nearly 150 ye=
ars ago, at the Battle of Puebla, a band of Mexican patriots faced off agai=
nst a massive European army and won a victory that inspires the world to th=
is day.

Less well-known is that General Zaragoza, who led those patriots, was born =
in what is now the town of Goliad in Texas.  In fact, you can go there toda=
y -- are you from there?

...

So the glory of this day is shared by both of our countries. And so is our =
pride in the lasting contributions that Hispanics have made to America thro=
ughout our history, including the men and women who join us here tonight.

...

Now, by celebrating the story of Hispanics in America, we're really celebra=
ting the larger story of America.  After all, the dreams of Mexican America=
ns and all Latinos are the same dreams as any other American.  It's why, in=
 the face of an unprecedented economic crisis, we took bold action to get o=
ur economy growing again, creating jobs again and laying the foundation for=
 lasting prosperity.

...So today reminds us that America's diversity is America's strength.  Tha=
t's why I spoke out against the recently passed law in Arizona.  (Applause.=
)  Make no mistake, our immigration system is broken.  And after so many ye=
ars in which Washington has failed to meet its responsibilities, Americans =
are right to be frustrated, including folks along border states.  But the a=
nswer isn't to undermine fundamental principles that define us as a nation.=
  We can't start singling out people because of who they look like, or how =
they talk, or how they dress.  We can't turn law-abiding American citizens =
-- and law-abiding immigrants -- into subjects of suspicion and abuse.  We =
can't divide the American people that way.  That's not the answer.  That's =
not who we are as the United States of America. ...

So, today I want us to remember -- the United States and Mexico are not sim=
ply neighbors, bound by geography and history. We're two societies that are=
 woven together by millions of family and friends, by common interests and =
a shared future.  Those are bonds that are unbreakable.  They're bonds of a=
n aspirational community -- you and your mothers and fathers, and brothers =
and sisters who struggled and sacrificed to realize the American Dream.  Th=
ey're also bonds of commerce and trade that sustain millions of jobs -- bot=
h in Mexico and in the United States.

<<link>>
nco-de-mayo-reception
But this is really a day for commemorating our shared heritage.  Our shared=
 heritage -- Mexicans and Americans.  It's a day for remembering that Ameri=
ca is a richer, stronger, more vibrant place thanks to the contributions of=
 Mexican Americans to the life of this nation -- contributions in commerce,=
 culture, in language and literature, in faith, and obviously in food.  (La=
ughter.)...
we all come from different backgrounds, we have different beliefs, we have =
sometimes petty and sometimes not-so-petty political differences. But we al=
l share a set of ideals.  We all have a common future.  We're the heirs to =
mothers and fathers and grandparents, great grandparents, who struggled and=
 sacrificed to forge and realize the American Dream.

      And that fills us with the collective responsibility to leave an even=
 bigger and bolder, more generous, more compassionate nation for our childr=
en.
