You know I appreciate you all and the hard work everyone puts in on this team. That said, the Hunger Games are back, or at least they can be! If members of our team don't volunteer to monitor we'll have to start assigning so that we have a balanced rotation.

So here are the details, we need 2 volunteers to monitor tomorrow from 8pm-midnight (or whenever coverage ends). If you haven't volunteered lately or at all, please sign up first. Otherwise we'll switch back to assigned rotations. Thanks Team.
