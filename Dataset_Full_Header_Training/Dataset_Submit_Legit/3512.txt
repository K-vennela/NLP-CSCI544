I don’t think I can engage with MRC until tom knows…. He thinks he’s bidding against mrc per lu…. And modi wants to do it at 48m per lu and only pay us 4% distribution fees which we would never do.This is a bit of a mess (clearly), but I think to mellow it all, we should deal with our internal colleague first, then MRC…..  ______________________
