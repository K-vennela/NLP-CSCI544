Understand why david threw me under the bus..no problem…larry  now understands that everything we did was contractually above board…and why I was unable to give him heads up….also explained to him that we probably do a poor job merchandising what we do above and beyond our obligation as owners..which is significant..i know your pissed…david’s pissed……this happens to be an amazing  deal that not only helps the company long term but will allow the aspire pool to be fully funded….and if handled right will not effect gsn….so no apologies…just doing my fucking job..
