Hi Tom,

Virgie sent me a copy of the program book for the luncheon SRB is keynoting this Saturday.  Might help as you include acknowledgements, etc into the mix for her speech.  I'll plan to send the speech along with her briefing on 4/27.

Hi Tom,

SRB is scheduled to keynote a lunch celebrating 30 years of Democratic women in politics in domain.com, Michigan on Saturday, April 30th.  This was an invitation from Black Caucus Chair, Virgie Rollins who is also an officer for the National Federation of Women.  Virigie has asked that her remarks last about 15mins long to a crowd of 300-500 democratic women activists.  When I asked Virgie what she wanted SRB to speak on, she said that she'd like her to "tell her story."  I think that since the Jefferson Jackson dinner is later that night, we need to add some call to action language and tie in the importance of voting since the room will be packed with a lot of grassroots activists.  Since she'll be speaking in her capacity as Secretary of the Party, I'm not sure if we've been incorporating language about republican state of play, or how either of our two candidates outweigh the Republican field into officer remarks of late, the importance of women in this election, etc-- but that may be some good messaging as well to this group.  Also, if there's any kind of "ask" she could make of them during the speech (text xxxxxx to xxxx) or something like that (if we had anything like that set up), might be good considering the audience.  I don't know-just some ideas.

I've copied Howard domain.com, SRB's comms person on this email.  Howard, do you all have any speeches where SRB has "told her story" that Tom could use in putting together some draft remarks for this keynote?  I think she might have some standard language she uses-but it would be good if it all didn't have to be/sound scripted, so let us know!

Tom-we probably need some draft remarks by 4/27 so her team (copied on this email) can review to ensure they are comfortable on their end.

Let me know if you have any questions (see below for the details I do know),

Julie
