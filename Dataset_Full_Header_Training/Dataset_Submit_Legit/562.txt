** THE BIG QUESTION

What was your favorite moment from last night's White House Correspondents=
 Association dinner?

TURNING TO INDIANA
------------------------------------------------------------
GREG GIROUX sends in a gem of a cheatsheet on Tuesday's Indiana presidenti=
al primaries.
Here's the basic rundown on its contents:
* Demographic and political information by county (tab 1) and congressiona=
l district (tab 2).
* Maps
* Summaries of each party's delegate-selection process.
* For context=2C results by county for the 2015 GOP Senate primary won by=
 Richard Mourdock over Dick Lugar=2C the 2015 Republican Senate primary wo=
n by Dan Coats over Marlin Stutzman and the 2015 Democratic presidential a=
nd gubernatorial primaries.
* Indiana results for the Reagan-Ford contest in 1976=2C the last time the=
re was a competitive Republican presidential primary in the Hoosier state.

JANET HOOK reports on a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll (<<link>>
domain.com/articles/donald-trump-holds-15-point-lead-ahead-of-republican-riva=
ls-in-indiana-poll-1462107603)  that shows Trump up 15 points=2C 49 percen=
t to 34 percent=2C over Ted Cruz in Indiana. The same poll has Hillary Cli=
nton leading Bernie Sanders=2C 50 percent to 46 percent=2C in the Hoosier=
 state.

It would take more than just an upset in Indiana to derail either Trump or=
 Clinton. Lee Miringoff=2C director of the Marist College Institute for Pu=
blic Opinion=2C said last Tuesday's primaries cemented the status of the t=
wo parties' favorites.

** NEWSMAKER OF THE WEEK: KEVIN BLEYER
------------------------------------------------------------
KEVIN BLEYER=2C a veteran of "The Daily Show" who works on the team that w=
rites the president's speech for the White House Correspondents Associatio=
n dinner=2C is Sidewire's Newsmaker of the Week. He's also written for Bil=
l Maher and Dennis Miller=2C authored books and even helped start a comedy=
 program in Kyrgyzstan.

This morning=2C as he came nearer to capping off his WHCD post-party exper=
ience=2C Kevin answered a few questions about politics=2C comedy and what=
 drew him to the funny side of a serious subject.

Click Here (<<link>>
56e0a7d8cacc2f54947)  for the full Newsmaker of the Week interview.

HERE ARE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS:

On what made him a political junkie
------------------------------------------------------------

"Honestly=2C I'd have to say Bill Maher. Long before I joined Jon Stewart=
=2C I wanted to be a real honest to goodness journalist. A war corresponde=
nt in some far flung hotspot. Instead I got a job writing jokes for Bill o=
n Politically Incorrect. ... Journalism with laughs. Seems a safer route.=
 Sometimes."

-da31dcf13f4c)

------------------------------------------------------------
On whether there's a difference between writing for a liberal comedian and=
 a conservative comedian
------------------------------------------------------------

"Oh=2C not as much as people might expect. But to borrow from some genius=
 Colbert (and from his genius writers) I suppose it might be said that a j=
oke=2C like reality=2C has a known liberal bias."

917c1bf)

------------------------------------------------------------
On Obama's strength as a comedian
------------------------------------------------------------

"He does one thing effortlessly that's vital: his demeanor suggests he's h=
aving a hell of a time up there too. He knows it's a great opportunity to=
 settle a few of the more harmless scores under the cover of comedy."

------------------------------------------------------------
On the challenges of starting a comedy show in Kyrgyzstan
------------------------------------------------------------

"I helped launch a political satire show in Bishkek not too long ago. It w=
as simple: fewer references to John Kasich=2C more references to former so=
viet leaders=2C and about the same number [of] references to Kim Kardashi=
an."

#BERNED-OUT DONORS
------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT BERNIE SANDERS DID THIS YEAR WITH GRASSROOTS FUNDRAISING is nothing s=
hort of jaw-dropping. But=2C as JOHN WAGNER reports for the Washington Pos=
t=2C April was the cruelest month in a while for Sanders' fundraising: He=
 pulled in $25.8 million in April after stocking his treasury with $46 mil=
lion in March.

It's still a lot of money =E2=80=94 about what Hillary Clinton raised in M=
arch =E2=80=94 but Wagner points out why the decline is a problem (https:/=
/domain.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/01/bernie-sanderss-f=
undraising-drops-off-sharply-in-april/) .
------------------------------------------------------------

"But Sanders has emerged as the biggest-spending candidate in the race=2C=
 and his April total is not enough to maintain his pace of spending on tel=
evision ads and other facets of the race. Last week=2C the campaign announ=
ced that it was shedding 225 staffers to 'right-size' its personnel headin=
g into the final nominating contests=2C including Indiana on Tuesday."
