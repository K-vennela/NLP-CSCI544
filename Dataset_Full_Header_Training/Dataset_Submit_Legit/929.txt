I'm good, if there's an endorsement. Even if it doesn't come today.

"Mike Pence's endorsement of Ted Cruz is no surprise for those of us familiar with Pence's extreme record. They have a lot in common. Mike Pence signed the one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation; Ted Cruz has said rape victims should be forced to carry pregnancies to term. After Mike Pence signed the toxic and discriminatory RFRA law that will cost our state upwards of $250 million, Ted Cruz supported the governor and advocated the federal government adopt a similar law. Ted Cruz has campaigned for president on an extremist, divisive ideology, and Mike Pence has put that same extreme ideology into practice, caused Indiana to fall behind the rest of the nation." - Indiana chairman John Zody
