I am copying Pratt so that he can reach out to her. I know that Donna has a contract with ABC and CNN. Not sure how that impacts radio requests.

Plenty we can do there. Let's find out if Donna Brazile can do this.

Plus regional press. Any thoughts on what we should talk about this segment? They're very interested in talking about voting rights and state of the race sort of things.Thanks!

Subject: DNC's (First) Weekly Segment on SIRIUS XM
Hi Team: I booked a weekly segment on "The Morning Briefing" of SIRIUSXM's POTUS Channel. It will occur every Wednesday at 8:20AM EST and will run 7-8 minutes. We can shape this segment to be what we want it to be. Some options to consider:

  *   Push oppo...craft a weekly hit job that Research and Comms agree on. This will require a process that makes sense...like agreeing on an oppo point in the Friday week ahead; locking in consensus with show producers on Monday morning; pulling the research on Monday afternoon; synthesizing toplines and briefing on Tuesday; and amplifting the segment on Weds (factivist, social?).
  *   Reward/empower state parties...perhaps by booking a different state party talker every week to lend their local perspective on a national topic that relates to the general. This will require less process on our end as it will be up to State Party teams to deliver our TPs via a local perspectives.
  *   Assign the segment to a specific Organizationtalker. SIRIUS feels that this option works best to curate an audience through a familiar voice they associate with our Organizationbrand. Given the ongoing nature of the POTUS Radio team's commitment, if we go this way, we should assign the segment to someone who will never have another booking obligation in the 8:20AM EST slot. This, in effect, would be their show, their audience to build like Donna does on CNN.
Happy to discuss at tomorrow's Week Ahead, but those are my thoughts. I'm negotiating similar segment cycles with SIRIUS's "Urban" (topic: voting rights) and "Progress" (audiences: gay, afam), and will continue to expand as I connect with the rest of their producers next week.

To wit - Think of this as an opportunity to build the election's finest broadcast messaging specialists around inter-departmental briefing processes that make sense. Here to help!
