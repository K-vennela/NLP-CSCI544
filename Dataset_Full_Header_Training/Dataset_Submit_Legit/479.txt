  Mallory's history class

  Good afternoon Mr. & Mrs. Mosko -

I'm concerned about Mallory's performance so far this semester in history class.  In class Mallory is a great contributor, and I get the sense that she is interested in the material and understands it.  However, this is not the case with her tests.  Additionally, she has missed the test dates so far and I hope she will be present this Thursday to take the test with her class.  I've noticed in the past when students are absent on test day, the longer they domain.com to make up the work is reflected negatively in their score.   

What do you think I can I do to encourage Mallory to effectively translate her understanding of our topics into consistent completion of assignments and tests?  Any insights you have would be helpful to understanding how I can best support her learning this year.

Sincerely,

Maggie Weiss
