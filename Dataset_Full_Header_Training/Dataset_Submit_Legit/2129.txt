Also, flagging that the top political reporter in Nevada, Jon Ralston, published an article not so long ago in which he highlighted the fact that the NV Convention doesn't bode well for our Convention in July. Definitely something we should bear in mind going forward.

If what happens in Vegas happens in Philadelphia, the chances of a unified Democratic Party in the general election are virtually nonexistent and the odds of a President Trump suddenly don't look so long.

Clinton has a difficult needle-threading job keeping the Sanders voters in the tent as she moves towards November. But if Sanders does not soon disavow what his team here has overseen - and even the senator may not be able to douse the wildfire he lit - there is no reason to believe that what happened at the Paris in May will not happen at the Wells Fargo Center in July.

NYT is out with a story. We expect to see a letter from the State Party shortly that is submitted to the Chairs of the Rules & Bylaws committee, but that doesn't ask anything of the DNC, just to register their concerns about the behavior coming from some of the supporters, including death threats. Will circulate as soon as we have it.
