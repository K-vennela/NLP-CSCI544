Panel discussion. Donna Brazile, Ana Navarro, Former SC Lt. Governor Andre =
Bauer, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR)

Everything that DT says is apparently a suggestion. Do you think it might d=
isappoint some of his voters.

-Bauer: At least there=92s a candidate now who's willing to talk about impo=
rtant issues
-Brazile: Presidents don=92t just suggest things; Lincoln definitely didn=
=92t do that when it came to the Emancipation Proclamation, for instance
-Merkley: Shows that there=92s no ideological core there
-Navarro: His answer was a refreshing one, surprisingly; both HRC and DT ha=
ve flip-flopped; I=92m going to vote for Dwyane Wade

Tapper plays tape of DT being his own publicist, and then of reporter alleg=
ing that DT was the one who released the tape.

-Bauer: Average person out there doesn=92t think about this or care
-Navarro: I don=92t drink the DT kool-aid. I clearly think that=92s DT on t=
here

Interview with Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio

HRC is making a big deal out of DT=92s failure to release his tax returns. =
It=92s true that HRC has released her tax returns going back years, but isn=
=92t HRC a flawed messenger on this? (Tapper mentions her not releasing tra=
nscripts of her speeches to Wall St)

-No
-I don=92t know why DT doesn=92t want to release his tax returns; clearly d=
oesn=92t

Play old Brown campaign ad that focuses on =93cheating China.=94 Isn=92t th=
at a lot like DT?

-My position isn=92t similar to DT=92s
-I trust HRC on this because I see her plan
-DT has words, but no depth there

In-depth plans are good, but when you talk to working ppl other there, a lo=
t of ppl seem to be skeptical about HRC and willing to listen to Trump. Are=
 you worried?

-Of course I am
-Anything can happen in an election, but I also know that HRC will work on =
trade enforcement
-I also know that DT is against minimum wage, other things that matter to w=
orking ppl

Tapper asks about recent controversial report regarding Bill Clinton/Clinto=
n Foundation. Thoughts?

-If that=92s going to be Republican attack, it=92s not going to work

Poll showing DT beating HRC in your state. If HRC came to you and said she =
needed you, would you take the job?

-I love the job I=92m doing =97 period

-Starts off with report that Romney is trying to domain.com third-party candid=
ate

Interview with Paul Manafort

Meeting with Speaker Ryan.

-DT was not asked to change by leadership, and there=92s no reason for him =
to change

You look at negative ratings DT has with women/Latinos. Will it make it dif=
ficult for him to win the WH?

-That=92s convention wisdom that isn=92t correct
-HRC also has high negatives, needs to build up support among men
-It=92s an issue that will be dealt with

Tax returns, it=92s a tradition. DT had said he would release them in the p=
ast, why does he feel differently now?

-He doesn=92t. All he=92s said is that he=92s under domain.com
-domain.com is going back 8 years =97 that=92s what I=92m led to believe
-This is an issue that the media is interested in; not American ppl
-Tax attorneys would never advise their client to release tax returns under=
 domain.com

Is there something in taxes that DT doesn=92t want American ppl to see?

-No. He=92s said no, and I have no reason to believe otherwise.

Trump posing as his own publicist. Plays tape. Is the campaign seriously sa=
ying that it=92s not him?

-I couldn=92t tell you who that is. DT says it=92s not him; it=92s not
-I don=92t know the relevance of this, it=92s 25 years old
-We should be talking about immigration, terrorism, etc

Tapper pushes back.

-Tape does not prove that it=92s him
-Reports that DT leaked tape makes no sense either

Asked about 1992 report, citing ties to Ukrainian leader Yanukovych and pot=
ential conflict given that DT will be receiving classified briefings.

-I don=92t see the classified briefings; I=92m not in room
-I don=92t have any foreign clients anymore
-Only helped Yanukovych become more integrated, and was only involved in a =
positive way

What are some general election states that DT can win?

-There=92s a number of them. Michigan, Pennsylvania, NH, NH, Connecticut
-We think Democrats are the ones who have a very narrow path to victory (lo=
l)
