Even though the Florida primary was a month ago, YOU still need to select the DELEGATES that will go to Philadelphia and cast their vote for the Democratic Party's nominee for President of the United States. The number of delegates Sanders and Clinton receive has already been decided, but the people who will be those delegates has not been decided.
