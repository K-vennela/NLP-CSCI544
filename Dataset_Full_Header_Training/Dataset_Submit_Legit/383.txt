Oggetto: E Rabe GOES Hi, Lucia, I am now a member of the Global Entry Program, a US government program to allow me to more quickly enter and leave the USA.   Please advise our travel agent that when making reservations for me, they should use my membership number when buying tickets for flights:                    Rabe: Global Entry program Membership #985038824 I’m not quite sure how this works from Italy, but here, there is generally a place to enter that number when buying tickets online: Also — Do you know whether a visa is required for the UAE or for Singapore? Many thanks, Eric
