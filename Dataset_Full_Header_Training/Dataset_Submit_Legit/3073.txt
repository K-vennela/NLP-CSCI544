May 5=2C 2015 
by Eric Bradner
Welcome to the CNN Politics Nightcap and good Thursday night from Washingt=
on. House Speaker Paul Ryan set off a political earthquake by announcing h=
e won't yet support Donald Trump. Mitt Romney=2C perhaps Trump's most prom=
inent critic=2C said he's skipping the GOP convention. And Hillary Clinton=
's top aides have been interviewed by the FBI over her email server. Your=
 bartender is Eric Bradner (<<link>>
=3Dnl_pol_071915_profile?sr=3Dnl_pol_072215_bradner) . The tip jar: nightc=
user@domain.com (mailto:user@domain.com) .

** Civil war: Ryan vs. Trump in a high-stakes GOP power struggle
------------------------------------------------------------

So much for party unity: House Speaker Paul Ryan declared in an interview=
 with CNN's Jake Tapper (<<link>>
donald-trump-gop-nominee/index.html) that he's "not ready" to endorse his=
 party's presumptive presidential nominee=2C Donald Trump. The speaker sai=
d he wants Trump to unify "all wings of the Republican Party and the conse=
rvative movement" and then run a campaign that will allow Americans to "ha=
ve something that they're proud to support and proud to be a part of." But=
=2C he said=2C "we've got a ways to go from here to there."

It doesn't get much wilder than this: Ryan is now set to oversee a Republi=
can National Convention in July where the party will coronate a nominee wh=
o he isn't ready to support.

Trump's response to Ryan: "I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda=
=2E Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement abou=
t what is best for the American people. They have been treated so badly fo=
r so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first!"

What this is about: Tone and policy. Ryan has rebuked Trump over his Musli=
m ban=2C his immigration plans and the violence that has followed him on t=
he campaign trail. But the two also have huge policy differences. On free=
 trade=2C taxes=2C immigration=2C the minimum wage and more=2C Trump has b=
roken from conservative orthodoxy -- a problem for Ryan=2C whose dream was=
 to write tax laws at the helm of the Ways and Means Committee -- and Repu=
blicans who have prized purity on Capitol Hill.

What it means for other Republicans: Ryan just bought them time. If House=
 and Senate members don't want to hop on Team Trump=2C the speaker has giv=
en them cover -- and a way to deflect questions=2C instead of being forced=
 to say whether their alternative to Trump would be a third-party candidat=
e (or even Hillary Clinton). But if you're someone like New Hampshire Sen.=
 Kelly Ayotte=2C who just yesterdy said she'd back Trump=2C Ryan's timing=
 isn't the best.

The next step: The RNC's Sean Spicer told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the part=
y is working to set up a meeting between Trump and Ryan next week. "Happy=
 to attend=2C" tweeted (<<link>>
0939012?refsrc=3Demail&s=3D11) Ryan's spokesman.

** Anti-Trump movement: Convention-skippers and third-party talk
------------------------------------------------------------

Mitt Romney joined the list of prominent Republicans who won't attend the=
 convention (<<link>>
blican-convention/index.html) in Cleveland. His decision means the party's=
 last two presidents (George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush) and its last tw=
o nominees (Romney and John McCain) won't be on hand. How significant are=
 their decisions? The New York Times' Alex Burns tweeted this comparison (=
<<link>>) : "Imagine if=
 Bill Clinton=2C Al Gore=2C John Kerry and Ted Kennedy all declined to sho=
w up at the 2015 Dem convention. That's Cleveland 2016."

The real anti-Trump flamethrower is Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse=2C a freshman=
 Republican who spent some time on Facebook (<<link>>
efornebraska/posts/593031420862025) last night. He called for a third-part=
y candidate=2C writing: "Why shouldn=E2=80=99t America draft an honest lea=
der who will focus on 70% solutions for the next four years? You know ...=
 an adult?"

The third-party planning now involves some members of Congress=2C conserva=
tive blogger Erick Erickson told CNN's Gloria Borger=2C without naming the=
m. =E2=80=9CPlanning is continuing for a third party=2C=E2=80=9D he said.=
 =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t necessarily read this as Ryan endorsing a third=
 party=2C but it gives motivation to people who want a third party to cont=
inue down that track. I have had several congressmen reach out to me to en=
courage a third party because they are worried about turnout in (November)=
 because they want an alternative to Trump.=E2=80=9D

The newest passenger on the Trump Train: Rick Perry=2C the former Texas go=
vernor who once called Trump a "cancer on conservatism." He told CNN's Dan=
a Bash (<<link>>
trump/index.html) : "He is not a perfect man. But what I do believe is tha=
t he loves this country and he will surround himself with capable=2C exper=
ienced people and he will listen to them."
Buzzing
Donald Trump offered his thoughts for a happy Cinco de Mayo while eating a=
 taco (<<link>>) : "I=
 love Hispanics!"
Last Call

** Clinton email probe: FBI interviews Abedin=2C other aides
------------------------------------------------------------

Some of Hillary Clinton's closest aides=2C including her longtime adviser=
 Huma Abedin=2C have provided interviews to federal investigators as the F=
BI probe into the security of her private email server nears completion=2C=
 U.S. officials briefed on the investigation tell CNN's Evan Perez=2C Pame=
la Brown and Shimon Prokupecz (<<link>>
interviews-huma-abedin-clinton-aide/index.html) . The investigation is ong=
oing=2C but so far investigators haven't found evidence to prove that Clin=
ton willfully violated the law=2C the U.S. officials say. In recent weeks=
=2C multiple aides have been interviewed -- some more than once=2C the off=
icials said.

A Clinton interview still to come: A date for an FBI interview of Clinton=
 has not been set=2C these officials said=2C but is expected in the coming=
 weeks.

The response from Clinton's campaign=2C from spokesman Brian Fallon: "From=
 the start=2C Hillary Clinton has offered to answer any questions that wou=
ld help the Justice Department complete its review=2C and we hope and expe=
ct that anyone else who is asked would do the same. We are confident the r=
eview will conclude that nothing inappropriate took place."

** Setting the expectations: Clinton and Trump are both disliked
------------------------------------------------------------

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will both enter the general election as t=
he most disliked nominees in 10 election cycles -- and Americans' feelings=
 about them are intense. Writes domain.com's Harry Enten (<<link>>
domain.com/features/americans-distaste-for-both-trump-and-clinton=
-is-record-breaking/) : "These are people who don=E2=80=99t just like or d=
islike the candidates=2C they really like or dislike them. No past candida=
te comes close to Clinton=2C and especially Trump=2C in terms of engenderi=
ng strong dislike a little more than six months before the election."

History is working against Clinton=2C writes Yahoo's Matt Bai (<<link>>
=2domain.com/news/clinton-has-the-map-on-1421857612800054.html) : "In 1947=
=2C Congress passed the 22nd Amendment=2C which said no one could be elect=
ed to the presidency more than twice. In the 65 years since the last state=
 ratified that amendment -- comprising 16 elections=2C and six elections f=
ollowing an eight-year presidency -- only one nominee has managed to win a=
 third consecutive term for his party. That was George H.W. Bush=2C who ov=
ercame a double-domain.com domain.com late in the campaign=2C thanks in part to on=
e of the most ineffectual Democratic campaigns in history."

Hillary's better off than Bill was=2C writes Joe Klein for Time magazine (=
<<link>>) : "He had=
 larger problems than an email server: He had recently been found out as a=
 Vietnam draft dodger and a womanizer. People called him Slick Willie. Wit=
hin weeks=2C he would be in a deeper=2C darker hole than Hillary has exper=
ienced this year -- he would be running third=2C behind George H.W. Bush a=
nd the independent Ross Perot. By June=2C only 13% of the public thought h=
im trustworthy. He was toast."
