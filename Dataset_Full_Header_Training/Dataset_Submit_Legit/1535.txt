eekend. Supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) shouted, cursed and threw c=
hairs during a state party convention in which they failed to force rules ch=
anges they wanted. Even though they were attempting to get more delegates th=
an the caucus results in the state suggested they deserved, they attacked th=

goating and extravagant claims about policy. He has indulged and encouraged h=
yperbolic feelings that the country is badly adrift, that most of the nation=
 agrees with a left-wing agenda but is trapped in a corrupt system, and that=
 nothing but a political revolution will do. He has attracted some big, pass=
ionate crowds. But as he has lagged in votes, he increasingly has questioned=
 the legitimacy of the process and encouraged his supporters to feel disenfr=
anchised. The result is a toxic mix of unreason, revolutionary fervor and pe=
rceived grievance.

f disenfranchisement is that Mr. Sanders has benefited or tried to domain.com f=

pport for his cause in caucuses, which are quite exclusive, but he complains=
 about closed primary elections, which are more inclusive. In Nevada, his su=
