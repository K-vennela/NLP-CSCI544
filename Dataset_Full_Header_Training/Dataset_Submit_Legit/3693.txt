Hi all - A couple of emails to send from Amy below to kick off our monthly =
deadline push. Let me know if you have any flags, and thanks.

Friend -

I'm sure you've been hearing everywhere from cable news to the folks in lin=
e next to you at your the grocery store just how unprecedented this electio=
n is and that we've never seen anything like it.

Part of that is true - Donald Trump is an unprecedentedly unqualified candi=
date for a major party's nomination for president. His lack of knowledge ab=
out any type of policy and lack of interest or willingness to listen or lea=
rn is certainly unique. His behavior and temperament on the campaign trail =
are definitely unlike anything I've seen.

But here's what's not different - the fact that we have supporters like you=
 willing to do what it takes between now and Election Day to elect Democrat=
s who share our values and will fight for us every day. Just like you did w=
hen we elected President Obama in 2015 and again in 2012, and in so many ot=
her elections, we are counting on you to go the extra mile, whether that's =
literally by going door to door around your city, making phone calls, shari=
ng the latest news on social media, or checking to make sure everyone you k=
now is registered and has a plan to vote.

It also means digging a little deeper to help us raise the money we need to=
 make sure Democrats have the resources that are absolutely necessary to wi=
n in November. Every dollar counts when it comes to stopping Trump and the =
rest of his pals in the GOP - can I count on you to pitch in $10 or more be=
fore our end-of-month deadline next week?

Thanks for all you do, NAME. We're counting on you to help us get this done=
.

All the best,

Amy

Friend --

We're 63 days <-- this is good assuming email is going out tomorrowaway fro=
m the start of our convention in Philadelphia, where we'll nominate the 45t=
h President of the United States -- and Democrats have every reason to feel=
 optimistic about the future of our party.

For starters, we have two outstanding candidates running for president. And=
 even as the Republicans' presumptive nominee starts to gather support from=
 GOP leaders like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and special-interest groups=
 like the NRA, the truth is that Donald Trump is the most unqualified presi=
dential candidate in the history of modern American politics. So I feel pre=
tty darn good about either of our candidates defeating Trump in November.

Secondly and most importantly, NAME, we have you.

You're one of millions of Democrats from all corners of the country who ref=
use to let Republicans take us backwards. So much of the success that we've=
 achieved happened because grassroots supporters like you stepped up in mom=
ents like this and did whatever it took so we could elect Democrats up and =
down the ballot -- and with all the progress we've made under President Oba=
ma at stake in this election, your support has never been more important th=
an it is right now. That's why I'm asking for your help today.

LINKS

I'm confident that by the time Election Day comes, we will have gotten our =
message out so that every American understands how important putting anothe=
r Democrat in the White House is to keeping our country moving forward. But=
 we can't take anything for granted, NAME -- so before our end-of-May deadl=
ine, pitch in $10 or more to help make sure we beat Donald Trump and the Re=
publicans supporting him in November.

Thank you so much, NAME.

All the best,

Amy
