NEW 2016:

*         Fred Grimm: Billionaire sex offender from Palm Beach enjoys a special kind of justice.  Prosecutors meted out a special kind of justice for Jeffrey Epstein, larded with fawning obsequiousness, secret dealings and an astoundingly lenient sentence. After all, billionaires -- even billionaire sex abusers -- aren't like you and me.

Investigators documented that at least 34 underage girls, some as young as 13, were repeatedly exploited by Epstein and his buddies for their carnal amusement at his Palm Beach mansion from 1999 to 2007. According to court documents, the girls were required to administer "topless or nude massage while Mr. Epstein masturbated himself." Occasionally, "the conduct escalated to full sexual intercourse."

State and federal prosecutors happily reduced what amounted to hundreds of federal and state sex crimes to two state charges -- soliciting prostitution and procuring a person younger than 18 for prostitution. Meanwhile, the feds not only promised not to ring him up on federal charges, they granted immunity to his various co-conspirators.

The federal prosecutors -- who seemed cowed by Epstein's high powered attorneys, including Roy Black, Kenneth Starr and Alan Dershowitz -- worked out the secret plea deal without bothering to inform victims that their abuser would be spared federal charges.

The failure to notify the victims has been at the crux of a federal domain.com filed in West Palm Beach against the U.S. attorney's office in 2015 by two of the young women, identified as Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2. On Wednesday, their attorneys filed a 57-page motion demanding a summary judgment in their favor.

Whether or not, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra grants the motion, the document (along with the scores of attachments containing nearly apologetic emails and letters from prosecutors to Epstein's legal team) sure as hell prove that billionaires are treated with special deference in the U.S. justice system.

The correspondence shows prosecutors trying mightily to contrive a sweet plea deal that could be finalized before the victims or the media got wind of it. One exchange suggested that he plead guilty in Miami, "which would hopefully cut the press coverage significantly."

No wonder. Epstein received a piddling 18-month sentence for a crime that got less exalted sex offenders in Florida 10 or 15 years hard time. His less-than-hard-time amounted to 13 months in the Palm Beach County stockade. Except he was allowed to spend 12 hours a day, six days a week at his nicely appointed office as part of a work-release program. He then served the balance of his sentence under house arrest -- quite an imposition for someone with a luxury mansion on the barrier island.

Consider that this occurred at a time when low-rent sex offenders were forced to live like apocalyptic trolls beneath Miami's Julia Tuttle Causeway without water, toilets, electricity.

Of course, super rich Epstein, 62, managed to avoid such indignities. Nowadays, the convict is occasionally featured in tabloid photos, snapped as he flits about New York in the company of young, beautiful women. Justice -- the special justice for billionaires -- has been served.  [The Miami Herald Feb 12, 2016]

2015:

*         Justin Bieber Hires High-Powered Lawyer Roy Black in DUI Case:  Justin Bieber is bringing in the big guns in a bid to beat his DUI charge.

The singer, who was arrested in Miami early Thursday morning for DUI and drag-racing, has hired high-powered lawyer Roy Black to represent him.

Black, who is married to Real Housewives of Miami star Lea Black, is a civil and criminal defense trail attorney best known for getting Kennedy family member William Kennedy Smith acquitted of charges of rape in 1991.

He has also represented Kelsey Grammer, race car driver Helio Castroneves, Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis and conservative radio commentator Rush Limbaugh.

The 19-year-old pop star, who is Canadian, is being charged with DUI, driving without a valid driver's license out of the state of Georgia and resisting arrest without violence.

The police say Bieber admitted that he had consumed alcohol, had been smoking marijuana and had taken prescription medication. [People; Jan 23, 2015<<<link>>,,20779032,00.html>]

*         JEFFREY EPSTEIN ATTORNEY ROY BLACK DENIES ALLEGATIONS IN LETTER BY EX-U.S. ATTORNEY ALEXANDER ACOSTA

Attorney Roy Black is disputing claims that he, and other attorneys representing Jeffrey Epstein, pried into federal prosecutors' personal lives in attempting to disqualify them from investigating the billionaire sex offender.

Black also denies Epstein's attorneys "negotiated in bad faith," while attempting to reach an agreement with federal prosecutors.

In a written response Tuesday to the Palm Beach Daily News, Black disputes claims made against Epstein's defense team by former U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta. Those and other allegations by Acosta were contained in a three-page letter printed Friday in the online publication The Daily Beast.

Acosta was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida at the time Epstein was being investigated on federal charges related to multiple sex crimes with minor girls. Black, the Miami attorney who successfully defended William Kennedy Smith against rape charges, was part of Epstein's legal dream team.

Epstein was never charged with a federal crime. He and his attorneys struck a deal with federal prosecutors, which was outlined in a non-prosecution agreement. According to the agreement, Epstein had to plead guilty to two state charges, register as a lifelong sex offender and serve 18 months in jail. If he successfully completed those terms and served one-year of probation, then Epstein would not be prosecuted on federal charges as they related to approximately 30 to 40 victims.

In a written response to the Daily News, Black said, "We did present argument after argument why a proposed federal prosecution against Mr. Epstein was unsupported by the evidence. We detailed the so-called evidence during many meetings with prosecutors and agents.

"We were quite candid in disclosing all the evidence we had gathered in our investigation and I believe we made a convincing case why charges were not appropriate. I still believe that today."

According to Acosta, now dean of the Florida International University College of Law, federal prosecutors and agents met with Black in the summer of 2007. The prosecutors presented Epstein a choice: plead guilty to state felony charges resulting in two years imprisonment, registration as a sex offender and restitution for the victims or prepare for a federal felony trial.

What followed, Acosta said, was that Epstein's defense team launched "a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors.

"I use the word assault intentionally, as the defense in this case was more aggressive than any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had previously encountered," Acosta said in his letter.

Among the "legal superstars" on Epstein's defense team: Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, Kenneth Starr, Jay Lefkowitz and several others, including prosecutors who had formally worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office and in the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section of the Justice Department.

Acosta said that one member of the defense team warned him "the office's excess zeal in forcing a good man to serve time in jail might be the subject of a book if we continued to proceed with this matter."

Black said he's never heard anyone mention writing a book about the Epstein case. "Mr. Acosta claims we negotiated in bad faith by appealing to the Department of Justice in Washington," Black said. "Any person under investigation by a United States attorney, meaning any of the 94 such offices in the country, has the right to seek review by the Department of Justice and it is so provided for in their manual. Thus I cannot imagine invoking this right could be construed as bad faith.

"In our system of justice, people are given the right of appeal and there should be no implication of wrong doing by exercising it.

"Finally Mr. Acosta mentions we looked for personal peccadilloes of prosecutors," Black said. "I am not sure what he refers to but this never happened. We did point out misconduct and over-reaching by certain people involved in the investigation. Not only is there nothing wrong with this but it is a necessary part of the process. There will always be people who abuse the great power of the government and we can not stand by silently when it occurs."

The non-prosecution agreement was sealed in Epstein's state felony file until victims' attorneys successfully argued to make the document public in September 2009.

*         A-Rod escalates war with Yankees; team responds with a challenge: "Embattled Yankee Alex Rodriguez escalated his war with team higher-ups via comments from his new New York lawyer suggesting the team purposely mistreated him medically, and Yankees president Randy Levine responded Saturday afternoon with a strong challenge for Rodriguez.

Levine offered to release all the team's medical records while simultaneously asking A-Rod to release his records of treatment with Anthony Galea, the disgraced sports doctor who treated Rodriguez and was convicted of smuggling HGH...

Tacopina, showing no signs of shutting up, came out blasting after he was recently hired by Rodriguez as the latest in a long string of prominent Rodriguez legal people. Rodriguez and noted Miami defense lawyer Roy Black parted ways, but A-Rod is believed to retain sports attorney David Cornwell, plus labor law firm Cohen, Weiss and Simon, plus Jay Z's legal group at Reed Smith. Tacopina's comments came a day after 60 Minutes reported that members of the A-Rod camp leaked Biogenesis documents linking Ryan Braun and teammate Francisco Cervelli to Biogenesis, the now-defunct "wellness" clinic that provided PEDs to baseball players and is at the center of MLB's PED case..."

*         RUSH LIMBAUGH'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY, ROY BLACK, HOSTS FUNDRAISER FOR PATRICK MURPHY

"Memo to Patrick Murphy: If you want to win street cred with the 99 percent, don't have Rush Limbaugh's lawyer host your fundraiser.

Murphy, the Democratic congressional candidate hoping to unseat U.S. Rep. Allen West, has opened himself up to a lot of bad jokes with the fundraiser slated for tomorrow night in Coral Gables.

The event is being held at the home of Roy Black, the famed criminal attorney who defended Rush Limbaugh when Palm Beach prosecutors accused him of "doctor-shopping" for pain pills. Black is currently representing John Goodman, the Wellington polo mogul accused of driving drunk and causing a car accident that killed a 23-year-old last year.

Guests at Black's home will shell out $500 to $5,000 for the soiree. They'll also get to rub shoulders with a genuine celebrity: Black's wife, Lea, who has been a cast member on The Real Housewives of Miami.

Just to recap: Republican Allen West defends tax breaks for the wealthy, and Democrat Patrick Murphy holds a fundraiser at the home of a famous criminal lawyer and a reality-TV star. Ain't politics grand?

[Broward/Palm Beach New Times-December 6th , 2015 <<link>>]

*         LET'S GET DRUNK: ROY BLACK, POLO BOSS JOHN GOODMAN'S LAWYER; HOSTS YEARLY SHINDIG

"International Polo Club Palm Beach founder John Goodman, whose alleged killing of a 23-year-old man in a car crash last month is still under investigation, was nowhere to be found among those who paid homage to high-profile South Florida attorney Roy Black.

Funny thing, because when it comes to celebrities attending The Blacks' Annual Gala in Miami Beach Saturday night, Black and his wife Lea can always count on those he extracted from the criminal justice system. And yes, there may be some of future clients of Black's there, too.

Girls Gone Wild's Joe Francis was one of them. He once had tax and public morals problems, but Black made it all better. So he came to the Fontainebleau Miami Beach for the big party.

"He wins every case," Francis said. "His approach is different from other lawyers, partly because he never worked for the government as a prosecutor. He believes in your case 100 percent, and I don't know any other who does that."

Three-time Indianapolis and Dancing With The Stars winner Helio Castroneves showed up. Black got him out of his little tax evasion issue last year.

Yet John Goodman, who could soon be facing DUI and manslaughter accusations but hasn't been charged, was MIA.

And who could blame him?

Roy Black, after all, kicked off the open bar, three-course fiesta with this announcement to the 1,000-plus guests who'd paid up to $1,000 each: "If you guys don't get drunk and dance on the tables, then this party has failed!"

The Blacks party, which could rival most Palm Beach shindigs in the wealth and notoriety of participants,  has long been a staple of Miami's social life. And it raises millions for educational charities.

It gathers usually well-known figures from all facets of life.

The legal community, for example, was represented with the likes of Harvard prof Alan Dershowitz, who represented Palm Beach millionaire perv Jeffrey Epstein with Black; O.J. Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark, unrecognizable after years of plastic surgery; and Jim Ferrara, a successful local litigation attorney.

Also there: rapper Rick Ross; shoe designer Lisa Pliner; TV chefs Ron Duprat and Bobby Flay; The Real Housewives of Atlanta's Kim Zolciak;  poker star Noah Schwartz; Bob Seger saxophonist Alto Reed; Gov. Charlie Crist and his lovely bride, Carole Crist; singers Natalie Cole, Paulina Rubio and Gloria Estefan; boxer Lennox Lewis; former Miami Heat star Alonzo Mourning; Girls Gone Wild's Joe Francis; and others. (See them all by clicking here or on the photos)

Gov. Charlie Crist, who's running for U.S. Senate, was received like a rock star. Despite the polls showing he's behind Marco Rubio among Republicans, Crist pressed the flesh with a vengeance and showed he's still popular among the beautiful people.

And despite stories saying that his wife of a little more than a year is nowhere to be found, the First Lady was glued to her husband.

"He's a brilliant attorney who has extraordinary admiration of a lot of people," the governor said of Black. "He's a hard worker, and those usually get lucky."

Well, there was one failure that night: the Blacks couldn't auction off a Bugatti Veyron, the world's most expensive car. But then, who in this economy could get someone to bid $2.75 million on anything?
