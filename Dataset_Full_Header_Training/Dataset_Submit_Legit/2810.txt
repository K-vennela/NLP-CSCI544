I want to get this out quickly - haven't seen many folks writing about it and I don't want Bridge to beat us to the punch.

SL: 2015 is going so badly for the RNC, they put out a second autopsy over the weekend. Sad!

Body: We're not joking. Here it is<<<link>>>.

You may have missed it, seeing as the RNC only publicized their second autopsy in a tweet<<<link>>> from their Communications Director on a Saturday afternoon. No release, no email blast, no blog post, no tweets from the RNC's official accounts. Big departure from the fanfare used to roll out their first autopsy<<<link>>>.

We don't have time to go into all of the pathetic white-washing in this document so we've just picked out a few of the best passages for you:

*         Page 5: "The Republican opportunity has also been strengthened and expanded because of the Republican National Committee's Growth and Opportunity Project and the bold changes which grew out of it and which Chairman Priebus has implemented vigorously."

We're curious - which "bold changes" has Chairman Priebus implemented vigorously? And how has the GOP opportunity been "strengthened and expanded?" Because from where we're sitting - the GOP hasn't been this unpopular since the 90s<<<link>>>, their standard-bearer has the highest disapproval rating<<<link>>> of any nominee in history, and newspapers are literally holding funerals<<<link>>> for the GOP on the front page.

*         Page 9: "Words and Ideas Matter. 1. The wrong words cripple or kill."

Donald Trump may think he has "the best words<<<link>>>," but calling Mexicans "rapists," saying you want to "punish" women for abortions, and refusing to rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe sounds like some pretty crippling words and ideas.

*         Page 11: "Training our own candidates to avoid major mistakes becomes a much more important requirement for an effective campaign."

Trump has already said<<<link>>> he's not going to change his approach in the election, so any hopes of the GOP "training" him to avoid major mistakes is laughable. Looks like you just can't teach an old race-bating sexist xenophobe new tricks.

*         Page 11: "That narrative should be reflected in the GOP platform and at the convention and should be reflected in the messaging that is communicated electronically to every candidate and campaign in the country so there can be a unified chorus driving home the winning narrative and the winning choice."

With every Republican nominee from the 21st century agreeing to skip the convention, and given the current personal feud between Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, is there any phrase that is less applicable to the GOP right now than "unified chorus?"

*         Page 13: "Quality Campaigns Still Matter"

Amen. With the Trump operation getting dominated by the Cruz team in state-and-local level delegate fights, Republicans have to be feeling just fantastic about their frontrunner's organization and ground game.

*         Page 17: "Republicans have the opportunity to perform better among single women, younger voters, Asians, Hispanics, and African Americans."

Research - please find the best polling on these groups.
