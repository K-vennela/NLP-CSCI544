Subject: Communicating vacation/leaves or
unavailability




Dear Colleagues,




I would like to clarify the process to
communicate unavailability (e.g., illness, personal impediments) or
ask for vacations.

Kindly follow this indications to avoid
misunderstandings.




1. If you are asking for vacation/leave, check
with Alessandro for the period you intend to ask. Alessandro will
approve or negate based on the planned activities;

2. in any case, vacation or
unavailability must be promptly communicated
to user@domain.com




Please mind that this communication is
specific for you who are not resident in Italy.




Thanks for your cooperation,

Daniele
