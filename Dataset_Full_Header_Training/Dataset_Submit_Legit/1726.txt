Awesome. Should get this out ASAP so the oppo makes it into stories. Even better if reporters mention how quick we were to the draw.
Once our release goes out, we should flag for state party comm directors in IA, CO, MO, PA, MI, UT, AL, MN, WI, and TX. Good opportunity for them to unload w oppo as well.
