*Republican National Security Experts Raise Concerns about Trump=E2=80=99s
Dangerous Foreign Policy, such as his Admiration for Putin*

Republican national security experts, including former Secretary of Defense
Robert Gates and Congressman Peter King, the former chairman of the
Committee on Homeland Security, raised concerns over the past week about
Donald Trump=E2=80=99s dangerous foreign policy.  Gates and King criticized=
 Trump=E2=80=99s
admiration for Vladimir Putin and questioned his lack of a plan on ISIS.

Read criticisms made over the past week by Republican national security
experts of Trump=E2=80=99s dangerous foreign policy:

*Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates:*
<<<link>>
presidents/>
=E2=80=9CI have some real issues with things he=E2=80=99s said about nation=
al security
policy.  And some concerns.  I think there are some contradictions. You
can't have a trade war with China and then turn around and ask them to help
you on North Korea. I have no idea what his policy would be in terms of
dealing with ISIS. I worry a little bit about his admiration for Vladimir
Putin=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D

*Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates:
<<<link>>
presidents/>*
=E2=80=9CI
guess one of the things that makes it challenging for me is that he seems
to think that he has all the answers.=E2=80=9D

*Congressman Peter King, former chairman of the Committee on Homeland
Security:* <<<link>>> =E2=
=80=9CWell
I=E2=80=99m supporting the nominee of the party but I still have real quest=
ions
with him as far as national security. I don't think his Asian policy is
coherent because, again, if he does want to get in a trade war with China,
he has to explain how that coincides with him wanting to use China against
North Korea. If he wants to have leverage over China, how can be talking
about taking troops out of Japan and Korea.=E2=80=9D

*Congressman Peter King, former chairman of the Committee on Homeland
Security: <<<link>>> *=E2=
=80=9CI=E2=80=99m
very concerned about this romance he seems to have with Putin=E2=80=A6=E2=
=80=9D

*Senator Lindsey Graham:*
<<<link>>
will-evolve-on-foreign-policy>
=E2=80=9CHe
talks like Ronald Reagan one moment and then embraces Putin the next.  The
contradictions are just overwhelmingly to me.=E2=80=9D

*Senator Marco Rubio:
<<<link>>
will-evolve-on-foreign-policy>
*=E2=80=9C=E2=80=99My hope is that he can be persuaded away from those sort=
s of positions,=E2=80=99
Rubio said. =E2=80=98As of now that=E2=80=99s not the case.=E2=80=99 Rubio =
doesn=E2=80=99t agree with
Corker that Trump will see the world differently after he learns the
details of the issues.=E2=80=9D

*Former Secretary of State James Baker:
<<<link>>
-spurned-by-veteran-republican-adviser-baker>
*=E2=80=9CWhile Donald Trump met with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill
Thursday, a Senate hearing provided a forum for critics in his party to
take aim at his foreign policy proposals. At the prompting of Republican
Senator Marco Rubio, who dropped out of the presidential race in March,
former Secretary of State James Baker said that the world =E2=80=98would be=
 far
less stable=E2=80=99 if the U.S. left the North Atlantic Treaty Organizatio=
n or let
South Korea and Japan obtain nuclear weapons, proposals floated by Trump
during the campaign that made him the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee. =E2=80=98We=E2=80=99ve got a lot of problems today, but you=E2=80=
=99d have a hell of a lot
more if that were the case,=E2=80=99 Baker, who was secretary of state in P=
resident
George H.W. Bush=E2=80=99s administration, said without mentioning Trump by=
 name.
=E2=80=98NATO has been the foundation of peace and stability in Europe. The=
 more
countries that obtain nuclear weapons the more instability there will be in
the world.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D

*Former Secretary of State James Baker:*
<<<link>>
-223142>
=E2=80=9CMarco Rubio=E2=80=99s latest shot at Donald Trump came with an ass=
ist from James
Baker. The Republican Florida senator, who abandoned the presidential race
earlier this year after repeated drubbings by Trump, asked the revered GOP
elder statesman on Thursday what he thought of suggestions by =E2=80=98some=
 people=E2=80=99
that more countries should have nuclear weapons. =E2=80=98The more countrie=
s that
acquire nuclear weapons, the more instability there is going to be in the
world,=E2=80=99 replied Baker, a former secretary of state, during a Senate=
 Foreign
Relations Committee hearing.=E2=80=9D

*Former CIA Director Michael Hayden:
<<<link>>
-2016-5>*
=E2=80=9CMichael Hayden didn't mince words when asked about Donald Trump's =
proposal
to bar Muslim immigrants and tourists from entering the US. It's not
legally possible, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency
told Business Insider in an interview. It's morally reprehensible. And,
frankly, =E2=80=98it's dumb as dirt.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D

*Former CIA Director Michael Hayden:
<<<link>>
-2016-5>*
=E2=80=9CHe has not shown me the capacity to treat international issues wit=
h the
complexity and seriousness that they deserve.  And again, if I'm supposed
to ignore those things =E2=80=94 =E2=80=98that was just done for the crowd=
=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 frankly,
that's an even worse problem. I'm going to take him at face value.=E2=80=9D
