Good morning Geoff,

I am hoping to schedule an interview with Debbie Wasserman Schultz today, to talk about the delegate counts for the Clinton and Sanders campaigns... super-delegates, the convention, etc.  This would be LIVE by phone on KNX for about 5 minutes at 4:35pm today, if she is available.  She would be speaking with the hosts of KNX In-Depth, Charles Feldman and Chris Sedens.

KNX is the CBS News station in Los Angeles.  I think that Cong. Wasserman Schultz knows our program director Ken Charles, from back when he was in Florida for many years, and he had suggested that I try to reach her.

Please let me know if she can do this interview.  I know that your office is separate from the DNC, and that her roles are different, but I'm hoping that you can help facilitate this interview.

Thank you very much!
