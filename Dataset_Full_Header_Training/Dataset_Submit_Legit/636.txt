Register (<<link>>) for the ASDC Spring Meeting a=
nd Convention Walkthrough (<<link>>) in Philadelp=
hia=2C PA!
May 19-21=2C 2015 

At this time we recommend the following booking option:
Four Points Northeast: 866-716-8133 and mention the ASDC Spring Meeting

**The DNCC will provide shuttles to the Sheraton Downtown where all meetin=
gs will be held**
------------------------------------------------------------

Friday=2C May 13=2C 2015 
Dear Colleagues;

Democrats in every state=2C have an historic opportunity for success in 20=
16. The races for the White House=2C the senate=2C (Supreme Court)=2C cong=
ress=2C governors=2C legislators=2C county and local offices could all see=
 great gains.

There is limited time to prepare for this election=2C every minute matters=
 as we build an effective national grassroots effort for success in moving=
 our shared values forward at every level.

That said=2C in some states activists are calling for state party conventi=
ons to eliminate Automatic Unpledged Delegates (super delegates).  While t=
hey can pass a resolution calling on the Organizationto take such action in the fu=
ture=2C state parties do not have the authority to bind their delegates. =
 The process to change the charter must first go through the DNC=E2=80=99s=
 Rules and Bylaws Committee and then go to the full Democratic National Co=
mmittee for a vote (even if the convention votes to change the charter).

There are numerous ideas and suggestions on the issue of =E2=80=98super de=
legates=E2=80=99=2C I believe all deserve due consideration. But since an=
 actual change cannot occur prior to the November Election=2C I respectful=
ly encourage this conversation occur AFTER November. This election is just=
 too important

Here is the OrganizationCharter:
<<link>>

Charter: Article 9 Section 10 prohibits the binding of any delegate to vot=
e against their personal preference.

Charter: Article 10 Section 1: All Changes must be approved by Organizationmembers=
hip.
Bylaws: Article 20 Section 10c1: All changes must go to Rules and By-Laws=
 Committee for consideration before any action by Organizationcan occur.

As we continue to educate our local activists on the process and rules tha=
t serve as the foundation of our Party; I hope that we can move forward in=
 united fashion as we transition to the general election.

Thanks for all you do.
