** ABC says sorry
------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly Ripa might make jokes about her dispute with ABC when she's back on=
 "Live" Tuesday morning. But make no mistake: She was seriously aggrieved=
 by last week's bungled announcement that Michael Strahan is moving to "GM=
A."

ABC's top execs -- Ben Sherwood=2C Rebecca Campbell=2C James Goldston -- a=
pologized to both co-hosts=2C I reported this evening. (<<link>>

mc_eid=3D[UNIQID])  The bosses recognize that their plan "misfired." But=
 they've taken responsibility and believe the show is now back on track. C=
ampbell=2C the head of ABC's stations group=2C flew in from Burbank to wor=
k with the producers on Tuesday's show. Read the full behind-the-scenes st=

** "It's all about respect"
------------------------------------------------------------
Deborah Norville=2C who knows a lot about how TV execs treat female talent=
=2C told Brooke Baldwin today that Ripa's takeaway from last week was=2C "=
I'm not as valuable as I thought I was." And that stings. "It's all about=
