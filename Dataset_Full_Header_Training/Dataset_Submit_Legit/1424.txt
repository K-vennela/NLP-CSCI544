Subject: Faith Voices Against Trump

Hey--

Just wanted to flag this for you--and it's candidate neutral. There have be=
en two REALLY great moments where faith voices have come out and condemned =
Trump for bringing out the worst in America. This would be a great thing to=
 amplify however possible.

Really good opportunity for us to engage and institutionalize these faith v=
oices in the party infrastructure. It would be great to try and engage them=
 and get them to do something at convention, etc. Maybe do a vigil at the C=
leveland Convention?

All just ideas.

John

Called to Resist:
A very powerful letter signed by a TON of faith leaders:
"Trump=92s highly visible and vulgar racial and religious demagoguery prese=
nts a danger but also an opportunity=97to publicly expose and resist the wo=
rst of American values. By confronting a message so contrary to our Christi=
an values, our religious voices can help provide a powerful way to put our =
true faith and our better American values forward in the midst of national =
moral confusion and crisis."

As of this week, the nation faces a crazier election season than many of us=
