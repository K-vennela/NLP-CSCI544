Suggest we also add in Andrew if you guys want to get specific. But I don't know that we want to divulge what we've got. I'd rather go the route of an analogy:

Interesting that a developer and extremely smart, successful businessman wouldn't appreciate the concept of maximizing resources for the greatest return on investment. Didn't realize he just willy-nilly built his high rises on any old piece of dirt. Thought he would have conducted a quantifiable assessment of how much effort it will take, how much money it would cost and then set out a plan to ensure a positive result.

As for hosting huge rallies as his sole voter contact strategy - well, his crowds were YUGE but he still got 2M less votes than Sec. Clinton. Who, by using targeting, had people at her events who actually showed up to vote for her.

User,

Bill looking for a statement for this afternoon on Trump saying that data doesn't matter, only rallies.

Separately some on the record info on our voter files/tech.

Mark:

I presume you've seen Donald Trump's comments to the Associated Press about data, and how it's overrated, particularly for a candidate who can produce the huge crowds that have defined his campaign thus far. Wondered whether you guys wanted to take a bit at that, whether it would be you, Anu or User.

Also, for some follows pegged to his remarks, could you put on record some outline of the Dems' data operation, along the lines of what we discussed several weeks back in D.C.?

For the laymen/casual voter: What exactly does your voter file include? How many data points typically? How does the party use it? What's a practical example, for people who don't read books like Victory Lap, of how this information is used to attract voters to the polls?

On the operations front: How many DNC-paid operatives are in the field using this data already? Numbers/locations? I know this could get a little complicated given the distinctions among coordinated campaign staffers, state party staff, nominee campaign staff and Organizationdirect staff. Going for the best picture of what, functionally, the Democrats have on the ground and where.

Thanks,
Bill
