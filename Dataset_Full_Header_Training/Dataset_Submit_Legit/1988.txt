Hi User/Rachel,

Thank you for your interest.  Unfortunately the invitation is non-transferrable and  due to venue capacity and the number of original invitees, at this time, we cannot accommodate guests that were not on the original guest list.

If this should change, we will certainly let you know!  User, I hope you can still join us!

Thanks for your understanding.

If you have not yet seen the invitation, it is pasted below for your reference.  Please RSVP at your earliest convenience with your intention to attend or your regrets (in which case we will miss you at the event!).  The guest list is officially closing on Monday!
