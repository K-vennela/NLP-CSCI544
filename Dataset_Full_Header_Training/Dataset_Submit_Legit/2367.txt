Subject: Video Request: Gingrich on Fox News

Gingrich just finished on Hannity (first guest)

Praised Trump as a "very substantive" candidate
Of people that say they don't know where Trump stands on issues, "What domain.com are they one"
"Take back Washington" as subset of Make America Great Again
Trump is prepared to dismantle Washington education bureaucracy
