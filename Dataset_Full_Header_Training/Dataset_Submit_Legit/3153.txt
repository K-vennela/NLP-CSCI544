Hi Rachel,

It's Yamiche Alcindor, a reporter with The New York Times. We connected a few months ago through Symone Sanders during the Democratic Party dinner in South Carolina.

I'm reaching out now because I'm doing a story about black voters' loyalty to the Democratic party and wanted to speak with someone from the Organizationabout it. I'm interested in discussing outreach efforts, platforms, and how the party has remained the choice for many black voters.

I'm on deadline and wondering if someone might be able to talk tomorrow or Tuesday morning. Please let me know if you might be able to help connect me with the right person.

Thanks,
Yamiche
