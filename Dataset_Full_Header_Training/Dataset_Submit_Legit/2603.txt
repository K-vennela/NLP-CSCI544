 Dear Moniem,

As per our bbm once the Head of Dept will sign the EU statements and got from you the PO we will re-active the maintenance.

Until that date all request coming from the customer by our support portal will be not take in consideration and we will inform them to be in touch with you for a pending commercial aspect.

Remember to the customer that they are not in position to make a new infection ( since their invisibility will be compromise) and not in position to get any Hotfix (minus and Major one).

Dear Moniem, I can imagine why this delay and this is the reason why I'm here to inform you about the following (to be on the safe site):

we can undestand some delay but remember them, as I already inform the customer in my last year meeting, that if they will not renewal the Maintenance in a reasonable time frame, they will need to buy a complete new configuration. 

In a very simple word, they can't arrive on June 2015 and asking for the renewal and got all the benefits: we will issue them a new proposal as per the other new customer.

Please keep us update.
Best regards

 Dear Moniem,

Tomorrow the license will be expired and we are not in position to extend it.

Based on New European Export Regulation we need to have the EU statement stamp and signed from the end user

However we discussed from a months ago and still we don't have any PO, EU statement, we would like to inform you that we are not in position to give them the service. 

Best regards
