THE BIG IDEA:=C2=A0The success of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders is really=
 not about ideology. It=E2=80=99s about disaffection.

Americans, collectively, are not as angry as watching cable TV would lead y=

 their opportunities for upward mobility disappear and their life expectanc=
ies shorten=E2=80=94are looking to disrupt a status quo that has not worked=
 for them.

That=E2=80=99s what Sanders and Trump are both promising to do.

Only 26 percent of Democratic primary voters in West Virginia said they wan=
t the next president to continue Barack Obama=E2=80=99s policies. Clinton w=
on that group by a more than 2-to-1 margin. Sanders won around two-thirds o=

bama AND over half of voters who preferred more conservative policies. In O=
klahoma, Sanders also won with those who rejected Obama=E2=80=99s policies =
as too liberal and those who said the president is too conservative.

West Virginia may be an outlier in some ways. It will not be in play during=
 the general election, and Clinton is still marching toward the Democratic =
nomination. But this sense of disaffection cannot be ignored by the elites =
in either party any longer.

Three in 10 Democratic primary voters said they or a family member is emplo=
