Hey-Jenna and I are starting a new system once we have our summer interns start. We have 5 interns confirmed now and are working on confirming a 6th.  If you have an intern project, please ask us and we'll send it to an intern with capacity, or email the intern directly and cc us. That way we'll stay in the know about how much they have on their plates and we'll help them prioritize.

We only have Levi here over the next few weeks so keep in mind that we have less capacity. He'll be primarily working on press lists. If you have projects for him, keep Jenna and I in the loop.

Thanks!
