Oggetto: R: Answers to questions Dear MaratI’m here to wish you Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all of you. I would like to confirm me that the extension of the Maintenance will be sent to you by our support portal in a shortly time with a new expiration date of 15 January 2015. About the Contract Renewal 2015, can you please send us the contract before the 15 January 2015? This is allow us to be on the safe site and not face any “temporary” lock of the maintenance.Due the fact the contract will match the ones signed last year, I’ pretty sure that it will be easy to have it on beginning of January 2015. Hope that you can help me. Best regards  Da: Emad Shehata [mailto:user@domain.com]
