OrganizationTalking Points: Democrats Overwhelmingly United

Polls continue to show that Democrats are overwhelmingly united and excited about both of our candidates.
By and large we've had a great primary, with substantive candidates whose vision to move America forward lines up with the values of the American people.

And we're going to come out of our convention more unified and stronger than ever, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with their dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their party.

Just look at the new poll today from CBS/New York Times:

*         A new CBS/NYT poll<<<link>>+at+0&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=https%3A%2F%2domain.com%2F&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=Politics&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article> shows that Democrats are more united today than in May of 2008, disproving the myth of Democratic disunity heading into the 2015 election.

*         The poll showed that 72 percent of Senator Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton, and 78 percent of Senator Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton. In May of 2008, polling found only 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for then-Senator Obama, who was eventually elected to a landslide victory.

*         Furthermore, the poll shows that 80 percent of Democrats are "mostly hopeful" about the future of the Democratic Party, as opposed to Republicans, who are domain.com 55%-43% between "mostly hopeful" and "mostly discouraged" about the future of the Republican Party.

This echoes what we've seen in domain.com poll after domain.com poll after domain.com poll:

Indiana<<<link>>>:

*         Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they've been energized by the nomination contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But nearly 6 in 10 Republicans say they think their party has been divided by the battle being fought by billionaire Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut<<<link>>>:

*         Democratic voters, unlike Republicans, said the primary season had energized their party. Two-thirds or more of Democrats who cast ballots in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut said their party was more energized, while less than one-third said it was divided, domain.com polls showed.

New York<<<link>>>:

*         Almost 6 in 10 New York Republican voters say their party has been divided by the nomination process, while only 3 in 10 Democratic voters say the same about their party's primaries. Less than 4 in 10 GOP voters say they've been energized, domain.com polls show, compared with two-thirds of Democratic voters who say that about their side.

It's clear that heading into the 2015 elections, Democrats are united and energized, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with their dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their party.
