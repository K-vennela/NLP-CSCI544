Trump on O'Reilly Factor at 8pm

Change of tone on Cruz?
- Good competitor.
- I respect him

Consider Cruz in administration?
- Certainly a capable guy
- Something we could think about
- Haven't talked to Cruz or Kasich yet
- Would consider Kasich for VP
- Would consider Rubio for VP

Carson leading vetting committee?
- Carson not looking for VP job

Giuliani for DHS, Christie as AG, Carson as HHS?
- Would all be good choices

Attacks on Hillary?
- If she goes the low road, I'm fine with that
- Would prefer the high road
- But can go the low road

Orders to ships if buzzed by Russian planes?
- Call Putin and tell him not to
- If they do it again, they wouldn't want to do that

Shoot them down if they call your bluff?
- I might have to do something you wouldn't want to do

Protesters at CA Convention?
- Barely any problems
- Will deal with it just fine
- "I felt like O.J. Simpson"

Message for Vincente Fox?
- Get your money out because they're paying for the wall
