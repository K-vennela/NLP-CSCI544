CUMMINGS ISSUES STATEMENT
ON TWO-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF
BENGHAZI SELECT COMMITTEE

Washington, D.C. (May 8, 2016)-Today, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, Ranking Memb=
er of the Select Committee on Benghazi, issued the following statement on t=
he two-year anniversary of the creation of the Select Committee:

"Republicans have now spent more than two years and nearly $7 million of ta=
xpayer funds for the illegitimate purpose of bringing down Hillary Clinton'=
s poll numbers, as Kevin McCarthy admitted.  The Select Committee has disco=
vered no new evidence that contradicts the core findings of the previous bi=
partisan and independent investigations.

"Republicans are desperate to hide the truth, so they are selectively leaki=
ng misleading information to fit a partisan political narrative, withholdin=
g interview transcripts from Democrats to prevent us from publicly releasin=
g the facts to the American people, and completely cutting out Democrats fr=
om drafting the Select Committee's final report.

"Two years ago, I decided to participate in this investigation because we n=
eeded someone in the room to defend the truth.  Two years and millions of d=
ollars later, Republicans have lost any semblance of credibility as they co=
ntinue to drag this out as close as they can to the election.  Republicans =
should release the transcripts, stop squandering taxpayer dollars, and shut=
 down this disgraceful partisan charade before it does even more harm."

Top Ten Low-Lights from the Benghazi Committee

(1)  June 16, 2015:  Chairman Gowdy deposes Sidney Blumenthal after unilate=
rally-without any vote or debate by the Select Committee-sending armed Mars=

n his wife at their home, despite the fact that Blumenthal would have appea=
red voluntarily.  Gowdy and other Republicans<<<link>>
domain.com/news/press-releases/blumenthal-deposition-transcript-ready-for-relea=
se> ask questions that are completely unrelated to Benghazi, including more=
 than 160 questions about Blumenthal's relationship and communications with=
 the Clintons, more than 50 questions about the Clinton Foundation, and mor=
e than 45 questions about David Brock, Media Matters, and affiliated entiti=
es.  Gowdy later admits<<<link>>
domain.com/files/TG%20letter%20to%20EEC%206.22.15.pdf> he "never expected =
Witness Blumenthal to be able to answer questions about the attacks in Beng=
hazi, Libya."

(2)  June 22, 2015:  Gowdy unilaterally-again without any debate or vote-re=
leases<<<link>>

<<link>>

ired-vote-to-release-blumenthal> requests by Democrats to release Blumentha=
l's deposition transcript, which debunks Gowdy's many conspiracy theories.

(3)  September 29, 2015:  House Majority Leader-and Chairman Gowdy's close =
friend-Kevin McCarthy admits<<<link>>
evin-mccarthy-how-he-would-differ-from-john-boehner/?%22%20%5Cl%20%22sp=3Ds=
how-clips#sp=3Dshow-clips> that Republicans established the Select Committe=
e to drive down Secretary Clinton's poll numbers:  "Everybody thought Hilla=
ry Clinton was unbeatable, right?  But we put together a Benghazi special c=
ommittee.  A select committee.  What are her numbers today?  Her numbers ar=
e dropping."

(4)  October 11, 2015:  Gowdy's handpicked "conservative Republican" invest=
igator accuses<<<link>>

vestigative work conflicted with the interests of the Republican leadership=
, who focused their investigation primarily on Secretary Clinton and her ai=
des."

(5)  October 14, 2015:  Republican House Member Richard Hanna admits public=
ly<<<link>>
on_us_561ef9eae4b0c5a1ce62037e> that the Select Committee is "designed to g=
o after" Clinton:  "This may not be politically correct, but I think that t=
here was a big part of this investigation that was designed to go after peo=
ple and an individual, Hillary Clinton."

(6)  October 18, 2015:  Gowdy accuses Clinton of sending an email containin=
g the name of a classified CIA source, and his staff then accidentally leak=
s the name<<<link>>

domain.com/news/press-releases/cummings-responds-to-explosive-new-report-=
on-chairman-gowdy-s-links-to-stop> on links between Gowdy and Stop Hillary =
PAC, which describes itself as "created for one reason only-to ensure Hilla=
ry Clinton never becomes President of the United States."  Gowdy's leadersh=
ip PAC, Themis, shared the same treasurer as Stop Hillary PAC since 2013, a=
n outspoken Clinton opponent named Dan Backer who also served as treasurer =
on three other PACs that each donated $2,000 to Gowdy for Congress.  Only a=
fter being confronted with these facts by the Post did Gowdy return these d=
onations.  In September 2014, STOP Hillary PAC spent $10,000 on robocalls a=
nd other efforts in support of Gowdy.

(8)  October 22, 2015:  Gowdy holds a marathon, 11-hour hearing with Secret=
ary Clinton that is widely condemned by even conservatives commentators as =
a "carnival road show<<<link>>

ttp://domain.com/entry/trey-gowdy-hillary-clinton-benghazi_us_5=

not good for Republicans and for the country."  He tweets, "Face it, Trey G=
owdy failed miserably on Benghazi."  He then refers to him as "Benghazi los=
er Gowdy."

(9)  February 11, 2016:  Gowdy starts withholding<<<link>>
.domain.com/news/press-releases/cummings-statement-on-republicans-withholdin=
g-witness-transcripts> copies of Committee interview transcripts from Democ=
rats in violation of House rules.  He later explains<<<link>>
gov/news/press-releases/gowdy-announces-rules-to-ensure-equitable-access-to=

m Democrats because he fears they might release more of them in response to=
 his own unilateral releases:  "Committee transcripts will not leave the Ma=
jority's control due to the Minority's stated intention to selectively rele=
ase them at will.

(10)  April 29, 2016:  The Pentagon takes the highly unusual step of sendin=
g a letter<<<link>>
ic-members-respond-to-pentagon-letter-exposing-latest-republican-abuses> to=
 Gowdy exposing the latest GOP abuses, including dragging out the investiga=
tion, requesting duplicative and unnecessary witnesses, and asking witnesse=
s to "speculate or engage in discussing on the record hypotheticals."  The =
letter states that the Pentagon "expended significant resources" trying to =
locate an individual identified as "John from Iowa," who called into Sean H=
annity's radio show and alleged he was a Remotely Piloted Aircraft camera o=
perator and saw the video feed from the night of the attack.  Gowdy wanted =
to interview him even though the Select Committee already had access to the=
 relevant video from that night.
