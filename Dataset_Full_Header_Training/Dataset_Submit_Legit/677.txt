Trump Interview with Bret Baier:

Ben Carson leading VP search. You called him pathological?

-          Just reciting from his book

Rafael Cruz/JFK?

-          His father said terrible things about me

-          When I cite articles, it's up to other people to decide for themselves

Security briefings?

-          I can keep secrets better than anybody

-          I will be a lot better than Hillary with her emails

You said you'd reach out to Sanders' supporters. Would you also reach out to conservatives?

-          I already have the conservatives

-          Just a few bitter people who want attention

Ben Sasse advocating third-party?

-          Sasse doesn't know me

-          Would cause GOP to lose, jeopardizing Supreme Court

-          Supreme Court list of justices. Probably release before convention

Bush 41 and 43 not endorsing?

-          I understand why they're not

-          Hits George W. Bush on Iraq

-          Says they don't support him because he beat Jeb Bush

War in Iraq. You supported on Howard Stern?

-          No I didn't

-          "I said very weakly"

-          HRC made a big mistake voting for the war

-          You don't trust her because she was sleeping at 3am

-          NAFTA was signed by Clinton. NAFTA was a disaster

Cinco De Mayo message?

-          I have great respect for the Mexicans and their leaders

-          Our leaders are bad on trade because of special interests

-          "There's tremendous money poured into the Super PACs"

You announced National Finance Chair?

-          He will be raising money for the party

-          I will still be putting up my own money

Britain/E.U.?

-          I think they are better off without it

-          But I'm not making a recommendation

Puerto Rico debt/bailout?

-          Have to discount the debt

-          Bondholders have to take a hit

ISIS leaders?   (Trump appears uninformed)

-          Don't know who the leaders are

-          More than one leader

-          Taken over the great oil in Libya. We are doing nothing to blockade it

Taking out al-Baghdadi?

-          Another leader would just pop up if we took one out

-          We have an obligation to the world to get rid of ISIS

Have you met with Putin?

-          I don't want to say

-          I was in Russia

-          Don't want to hurt him by answering

-          I had a major Miss Universe event in Moscow a few years ago

-          They don't respect Obama

Left of HRC on Foreign Policy?

-          No. I'm tougher than she is

-          I believe in world peace

Policy modifications. Tax plan

-          "Certain things will be changed. Certain things will stay exactly the same."

-          There is a negotiation back and forth

-          Don't want to use many executive orders

-          Not a dictator

Elimination $20 trillion in debt in 8 years?

-          We can discount debt

-          Even people that don't like me will hopefully say I did a good job
