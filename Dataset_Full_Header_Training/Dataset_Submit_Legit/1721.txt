Also just want to flag that Obama nominated Bill Pryor to the US Sentencing Commission. I've discussed this in the past with Dillon/Mark, I don't think it should be a problem. The Sentencing Commission is completely different from his role as a judge. Obama would never appoint someone like Pryor to a judicial role.

Cool. Research, can we get a bullet for his interview where he said that women should be punished for abortion?

TJ can you work up a hit for Iowa re: Bill Prior?

I'll flag for Kaylie over at NARAL.

Trump has also said that abortion would be an important issue for selecting a justice:

TRUMP SAID ABORTION WOULD  BE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR SELECTING A JUSTICE BUT DID NOT SAY IT WOULD BE PART OF HIS LITMUS TEST

Donald Trump Said Abortion Was An Important Issue To Him But Did Not Say If He Would Have A Pro-Life Litmus Test For Supreme Court Appointments. TAPPER: "Let me ask you about a few social issues... just because I'm not -- they haven't been issues you have been talking about for several years. I know you're opposed to abortion." TRUMP: "Right. I'm pro-choice." TAPPER: "You're pro-choice or pro-life?" TRUMP: "I'm pro-life. I'm sorry." TAPPER: "Pro-life.  So how important is that issue to you now? When President Trump picks Supreme Court justices, would that be a litmus test?" TRUMP: "It is. It is. Look, you have a lot of pro-choice people out there. But that is an issue, it's very interesting, because, in terms of polling, the pro-choice is actually going down a little bit. You know, it's very interesting." [State Of The Union, CNN, 6/28/15]

Trump On Abortion As A Litmus Test For Supreme Court Appointees: "Well, I Would Certainly Be Asking Them The Question." TRUMP: "My statement on that happens to be, you know, if the mother will die. And you're going to know that. And the problem with the life: If you say life, what does life mean? You have a cold and you're going to end up having an abortion. So I have the three exceptions and pretty much the standard three exceptions that many Republicans have." CHUCK TODD: "Is this going to be a litmus test for the Supreme Court nominees that you pick?" TRUMP: "Well, I think I would certainly be asking them the question. And I think it would be, if not a litmus test, it would certainly be helpful in terms of my choices. I mean, I want great jurists. I want great intellects. And certainly that would be helpful to me." [Meet The Press, NBC, 8/16/15]

Trump On Selecting Supreme Court Nominees: "I'd Go Pro-Life." "'You know I'm pro-life,' he offered, responding to a question about how a President Trump might choose Supreme Court nominees.  Picking senior jurists 'is a very important decision. One of the most important,' he said. 'The next president could have three or four.' 'I'd go pro-life,' Trump said after a brief pause. 'I'd go pro-life.'" [Daily Mail, 5/22/15]

Trump: Abortion "Would Be, If Not A Litmus Test, It Would Certainly Be Helpful In Terms Of My Choices."

In 2000, Trump  Supported His Sister's Statement That A Federal Judge's Personal Views On Abortion Were Immaterial To Their Potential Appointment. "When my sister Maryanne Barry Trump, one of the brightest and most capable people on the federal bench, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing on her elevation to a federal judgeship in the Third domain.com Court, Smith insisted on asking her views on abortion. She patiently explained to the good senator that her personal views on the issue were meaningless; a federal judge's job is to uphold the law as it is written, not to interpret from the bench based on his or her personal views. Maybe if my sister had spoken more slowly he would have understood her." [Donald Trump, The America We Deserve, 2000]

TRUMP CRITICIZED THE COURT'S ROE V. WADE DECISION

Donald Trump: Roe V. Wade Evinced The United States' Slide "Toward A Culture Of Death." "Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago, over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of this country. They are missing, and they are missed." [Donald Trump Op-Ed, Washington Examiner, 1/23/16<<<link>>>]

Donald Trump: "The Supreme Court In 1973 Based Its Decision [In Roe v. Wade] On Imagining Rights And Liberties In The Constitution That Are Nowhere To Be Found." "The Supreme Court in 1973 based its decision [in Roe v. Wade] on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best." [Donald Trump Op-Ed, Washington Examiner, 1/23/16<<<link>>>]

Donald Trump: If Abortion Is A Matter Of Privacy, As The Supreme Court Ruled In Roe v. Wade, Then Only Private Funds Should Be Used For Abortion And No Public Funds Should Ever Go To Abortion Providers. "The Supreme Court in 1973 based its decision [in Roe v. Wade] on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best." [Donald Trump Op-Ed, Washington Examiner, 1/23/16<<<link>>>]

Donald Trump: The Supreme Court's Decision In Roe v. Wade Showed The Court's "Utter Contempt ... For Federalism And The 10th Amendment.  "If using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death were not enough, the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment. Roe v. Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people. This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision. Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government."

Couple things here:

Attached the doc I put together a while back when Trump was supposedly releasing his list of potential nominees.

Here's the article where Grassley said he believes Trump would nominate the right type of justice based on the fact Trump previously mentioned Bill Pryor as a potential nominee.

Des Moines Register: Grassley: Trump Would Nominate 'Right Type' To Court<<<link>>>

Last week, Grassley said it would be a 'gamble' to let Trump fill the vacancy:

Huffington Post: Chuck Grassley Admits It's 'A Gamble' To Let Trump Fill SCOTUS Vacancy<<<link>>>

Bill Pryor's Greatest Hits:

*         Called Roe v. Wade "the worst abomination in the history of constitutional law."

*         Opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest.

*         Urged Congress to repeal Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

*         Was the only Attorney General in the nation to file an amicus brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the federal remedy for victims of sexual assault in the Violence Against Women Act was unconstitutional.

*         In 2005, Lambda Legal called Pryor "the most demonstrably antigay judicial nominee in recent memory."

And here is a release Rachel and I put together about all of Trump's potential nominees to prepare for him possibly releasing a list. He should definitely be pressed to release it now - all of these judges fall right into our narrative over the past few weeks (terrible for women, for voting rights, for the LGBT community). It never went back around RR2 so here it is:

SL: Whom Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley Are Holding Out For

Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley have long been waiting for this day - to see whom their party's frontrunner would consider nominating to the Supreme Court. The day has finally come, and it's nothing pretty.

"The Supreme Court nominating process is serious, Donald Trump is not. Again and again he has demonstrated he lacks the experience and temperament to be an effective commander-in-chief. So it comes as no surprise that his list of top picks for the Supreme Court is full of red flags.

"The justices judges he wants to elevate to our highest court have a history of making the same sort of unpredictable, extreme decisions that we see every day from Trump. It's bad enough that Senate Republicans refuse to uphold the Constitution, do their jobs and hold hearings on President Obama's eminently qualified nominee. But, it's worse that the reason for the obstruction is their hope that Trump would get to nominate one of these judges.," - OrganizationPress Secretary Mark Paustenbach

No one is more qualified to immediately serve on the Supreme Court than Chief Judge Merrick Garland - but Senate Republicans continue to say they won't meet with Chief Judge Garland, hold a hearing or vote on his nomination.
