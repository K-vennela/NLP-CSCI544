Hi Sadie, we want to hit McCain on what he said today on CNN. Any concerns =
with the below?

SL: Senator McCain: "Oh, I don't know" if Trump should retract "rapists" co=
mment

Body:

"Oh, I don't know." That was Senator John McCain's response this morning wh=
en asked on CNN if he thought Donald Trump should take back his dangerous a=
nd divisive comments calling Mexicans 'rapists.'

See the exchange below:

"By refusing to condemn Trump's unconscionable remarks, Senator McCain will=
 own them from now until Election Day. The fact that Senator McCain is supp=
orting Trump and standing by his discriminatory comments about Hispanic-Ame=
ricans confirms that the GOP is now the party of Trump." -- OrganizationNational Pr=
ess Secretary Mark Paustenbach
