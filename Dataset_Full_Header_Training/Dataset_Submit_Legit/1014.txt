Hi - Great to see you as wel=
l.  Thanks for coming out there.
We will combine yo=
ur 2013-2016 contributions and put it towards the package plus the total ra=
ised from the event you hosted with the VP.  
As far as how it will work if Zach and I get booted to the curb, we have a=
 master list that we started cleaning up this year.  It is for the Nat=
ional Finance Committee which existed prior to my arrival and will exist fo=
llowing my departure.  Everything is accounted in there (and not in th=
e Enron style accounting from the past) but real numbers, so everything you=
 and Bonnie have done is accounted for.  I will also make sure - if I =
do get fired (do you know something I don=E2=80=99t) that I have a conversa=
tion with my replacement about everyone who stepped up in the dark years of=
 2015 and 2015!
