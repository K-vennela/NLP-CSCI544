Matt --

Labor Day is almost here, but there's one quick matter of business before we get ready to enjoy the long weekend: Our end-of-month deadline is hours away, and it's pretty damn important. We still need a few more supporters to start a monthly donation of $10 or more before midnight if we want to meet our goal -- will you be one of them?

Here's what we have on record for this email address:

NAME: Matt
EMAIL: user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>
2015 DONATIONS: $10
NUMBER OF DONATIONS: 1

This time next year, we want to be able to stand behind our nominee with the strongest support possible. The money we raise now has a huge impact on what we can bring to the table to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in 2016.

That's why I have to ask -- will you step up, Matt?

Thanks so much -- we seriously couldn't do it without you.

Have a great Labor Day!

P.S. -- If you donate by tonight's deadline, you'll be automatically entered to win a chance to meet President Obama in New York City next month. How can you turn that down?

Matt --

OK picture this: You, your best friend, President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Secretary Hillary Clinton. All in the same place.

I want to make that happen, so we'll send a lucky winner to an event with all FOUR of them and put you and your friend up in a nice hotel in D.C. I'm telling you all this because I really do want you to have this chance (and it's worth mentioning: As a staff member here at OrganizationHQ, I'm not eligible to win).

Just pitch in $10 or whatever you can to be automatically entered:

You're one of our most committed supporters. Because you've saved your payment information, your donation will go through immediately.

QUICK DONATE: $10<<<link>>>

QUICK DONATE: $25<<<link>>>

QUICK DONATE: $50<<<link>>>

QUICK DONATE: $100<<<link>>>

QUICK DONATE: $200<<<link>>>

Or donate another amount:

Good luck, Matt.

Matt, I love this time of year -- when I get to kick back with my family and watch some late-November football, do a little bit of bargain shopping, and make as many meals as possible with all of the leftover turkey in our fridge. (Seriously, there's way too much!)

But in the midst of all the hoopla and holiday cheer, I've had this in the back of my mind: By next Thanksgiving, we will have already elected the next President of the United States.

With less than a year before we decide just who becomes our next president, time really is of the essence. And if we're going to protect the progress we've made together during President Obama's time in office, then we need to make sure another Democrat follows him.<<<link>>>

To borrow a metaphor from the official sport of the Thanksgiving season, we need every player on the field and every head in our team's huddle to win in 2015 -- so if you're ready to show your Democratic pride, and help Democrats keep the White House and take back Congress, then pitch in $10 or more before our end-of-month deadline, and we'll make sure you're one of the very first supporters to receive our Official 2015 Membership Card.

You're one of our most committed supporters. Because you've saved your payment information, your donation will go through immediately.

Like inches on a football field, Matt, every dollar counts during an election season. So thanks for stepping up today.

I'll be in touch again soon.
