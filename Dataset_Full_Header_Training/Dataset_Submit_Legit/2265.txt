Van Jones: I wish Priebus was Organizationchair<<<link>>>

The Hill

By Jesse Byrnes<<<link>>>

Liberal commentator Van Jones on Wednesday said he'd prefer the chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC) to his own party's chair after a "leadership failure" on the Democratic side.

Jones knocked Organization (DNC) Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz for her response<<<link>>> to Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders<<<link>>> on Tuesday in light of the contentious Nevada Democratic convention.
"Debbie, who should be the umpire, who should be the marriage counselor, is coming in harder forHillary Clinton<<<link>>> than she is for herself. That is malpractice," Jones told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Wednesday.

"I wish Reince Priebus was my party chair. He did a better job of handling the Trump situation than I've see my party chair handle this situation," Jones said. "I'm ashamed to say that. Yeah, I said it."

The former Obama administration official and CNN analyst appeared on the network to comment on Democratic infighting<<<link>>> following a brouhaha at the Nevada convention over the weekend.

Schultz chided<<<link>>> Sanders, saying his response to the convention chaos was "anything but acceptable." She called on Sanders to condemn his supporters for "acting violently or engaging in intimidation tactics."

After Sanders's campaign manager Jeff Weaver accused Schultz of "throwing shade" at the Vermont senator "since the very beginning," Schultz responded<<<link>>> with "#SMH" - "shaking my head."

"I think they are fundamentally misreading and misunderstanding what the Sanders movement is," Jones said Wednesday of the response from Democratic Party leaders. "If you come out and just smash on one side, you lose your ability to be the arbiter."
