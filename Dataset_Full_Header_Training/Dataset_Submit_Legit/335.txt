Mr. Giancarlo,  Referring to your email dated April 7, 2015, please be informed that the deduction that took place by TCC on some of your payments came to cover the withholding tax for the Income and Zakat Department – KSA according to section (E) payments terms paragraph (4) within our purchase order no. TCC-LPO-0026-09-12-V5 dated 26.09.2012 approved by your company.Furthermore, and as for the obtained tax exemption received from your company, please be informed that we submitted the exemption on behalf of your company to recover the paid withholding tax and the recovery is still under process. (please refer to the attached)Despite of the above, and despite the fact that it won’t be fair for TCC to pay withholding tax on your company’s behalf, but in order to maintain our unique business relation, we have concluded a wire transfer for the domain.com of your company for the amount of (17,175.00) Seventeen thousand one hundred seventy five Euro which represents (50%) of the deducted amounts against the withholding tax.  We will transfer the remaining (50%) as wire transfer within (5) working days, accordingly your company is required for immediate return back for Services to our customer without any further delays.Hoping to succeed in recovering the paid withholding tax.Best Regards,   SALEM H.
