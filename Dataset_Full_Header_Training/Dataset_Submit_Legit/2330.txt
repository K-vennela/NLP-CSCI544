Subject Line: Cruz in December: @realDonaldTrump is terrific. #DealWithIt

Body: Ted Cruz is as disingenuous as they come.

Back in December, when Cruz thought he could help his own poll numbers by clinging to Donald Trump like a baby koala, he tweeted this:

Now that Cruz has no path to nomination, he's decided to lash out and throw the oppo book at Trump in a last-ditch effort to save his own grand political ambitions.

But at the end of the day, Cruz still hasn't reneged on his promise to support Trump as the GOP nominee. So there you have it: Ted Cruz's criticisms of Trump have nothing to do with conviction and everything to do with what helps Ted Cruz politically.

Ironically, in a press conference that may prove to be Cruz's last as a candidate, he seems to have perfectly confirmed the moniker used against him in this campaign. He really is Lyin' Ted.
