*         Sanders has put his mark on the Dem Party, it may be more populist / progressive overall

o   I think we've had a very spirited contest, we share a lot of the same goals

*         Sanders says you should make platform concessions on Wall St in exchange for his supporters

o   let's look at where we are, I have 2.7M more votes, big lead in pledged delegates

*         are you going to do anything different to win over Sanders supporters from what you're doing now

o   let's look at 08. that race was similar but so much closer

o   when I withdrew, I didn't put down conditions, I said I am supporting Sen Obama, because no matter our differences, they pale in comparison to our differences with Republicans.

o   I spent an enormous amount of time convincing my supporters to support him, and the vast majority did.

*         if you are ahead in June-

o   I AM AHEAD IN THE VOTE RACHEL

o   what Sanders and his supporters are saying doesn't add up, I have way more support than Sanders does

o   we're going to work together, but I am ahead, and let's start from that premise when we talk about what happens next

*         should Sanders drop out June 7

o   that's up to him. I didn't want to hurt Obama in 08 by not withdrawing

*         Koch said you may be better president than Trump or Cruz, I know you don't want his endorsement, do you have a plan to lobby for GOP votes?

o   their primary isn't over yet

o   I really am not looking for endorsements from people who deny climate change, have views Koch brothers have

o   I will let Republicans work that out

o   I will be talking to the American people about what I think we need to do now

*         what kind of role might there be for Sanders in HRC administration?

o   I can't say that yet, too early

o   I am already raising money for Dems down ballot, campaigning for them, you can count on me forming a vital Dem party

o   we need a better pipeline for raising Dems up the ladder

*         how will you change the Dem Party?

o   I think we have good examples from most recent Dem presidents

o   some raise questions about how much they've done, but I had a front row seat, saw how much they got accomplished when they had a Dem Congress

o   they pushed through a lot of changes with Dem congress

o   Dems didn't show up in midterm elections

o   I want to be absolutely clear that we have to support a Dem president, show up to elect Dems in Congress and in states

o   we see what Republican governors are doing on choice, voting rights, LGBT rights

*         as a black woman lawyer, I face discrimination, how would you address systemic racism?

o   you are absolutely right, still in employment, healthcare, education, justice system

o   first, we have to talk about it more. as a white person, I have to talk about it more, say we are not a post-racial society

o   it's not only wrong but holding us back-we want a productive society

o   we have to enforce civil rights law, use bully domain.com to speak out, speak up to organizations

o   I chaired commission on women in profession as a young lawyer, because there's a lot of sexism too.

o   one of great powers of POTUS is to be convenor-in-chief

*         min wage

o   support fight for 15, getting to 12 would be major accomplishment

o   real difference is with Republicans who don't want to raise wage

*         points of differentiation to expect from Obama?

o   doesn't get domain.com he deserves, esp in saving our economy

o   get government out of business of making money off student loans

o   build on ACA

*         gun control

o   important to take back Dem Senate

o   Dems have decided they will be led by Chuck Schumer, he's a champion of it

o   you have to start early, fight every day

o   hold members of Congress accountable in midterm

o   we're going to take on gun lobby and addressing gun violence culture

o   too many young people are turning to guns to settle disputes and resentments

*         equal pay

o   [lily ledbetter]

*         50% women in domain.com?

o   they are 50% of our country, domain.com is going to look like our country

o   that's a yes

*         family detention

o   I oppose it, want path to citizenship

*         unions

o   incentives to bring companies back to America

o   companies that take any taxpayer money have to pay it back before they move overseas

o   committed to making sure unfair trade practices don't cost us jobs

*         [stream cut out]
