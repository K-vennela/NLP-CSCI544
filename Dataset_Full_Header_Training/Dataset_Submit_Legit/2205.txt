Nothing real interesting on Trump being more presidential. Says multiple times there will be no second ballot at the convention and that is why the campaign isn't focused on stealing state delegates like Cruz is

Paul Manafort interview

*         You met with RNC to reassure them, said Trump has been playing a part. He's been campaigning for 10 monhs and we haven't seen real man?

o   That was about what settings he's been. You've seen real Trump in campaign mode

o   RNC has a different mode-wants to know if Trump is going to be giving policy speeches, etc, which he will

*         But it does sound like spin, doesn't seem like you were talking about rallies vs speeches

o   But that is what I was saying, it's been distorted

o   Trump has been saying when I'm at rallies, I want to show you who I am in this environment, when I'm giving policy speeches, I'm giving policy speeches

*         Cruz has said Trump the Conservative is just a show, trying to fool gullible voters

o   Well there's the liar, not Trump

o   He's got to change to conversation, narrative, because he's had the nomination eliminated for him

o   Cruz made this up from whole cloth, trump never said he isn't building a wall

o   Cruz is going to lose all five Tues states, come in third in most

o   Like with Carson and Rubio, Cruz just makes things up

*         Cruz had a good weekend-one of your jobs is to get delegates committed, Cruz won a lot of their support, 65-2 for you

o   You've been around a long time Chris, the only vote that matters is the vote cast when the roll is called. Cruz won 0 delegates for that vote yesterday

o   Other problems happened before I was involved

o   Cruz is bending to rules, in Maine the governor put together a slate based on primary results, Cruz broke the deal, didn't care about local officials, steamrolled it. That's not the trump approach

o   We're running a campaign to win folks on first ballot, and we are

o   What Cruz is doing is hurting the party. There will be no second ballot.

*         You became a lobbyist after Reagan white house, you have controversial clients (foreign dictators), your firm were called torturer's lobby

o   I was representing the administration's chosen groups in Philippines, other countries

*         Not Yanukovich

o   I worked with Europeans to bring Ukraine into Europe, role I played was to help that happen

*         Cruz calls yours a lobbyist campaign

o   The people he's talking about haven't been lobbying for 10-20 years

*         His point is that Trump's anti-establishment outsider status is no longer valid

o   I'm not running, Trump is, Trump is clearly an outsider, and he's established that

o   Cruz is trying to say the process, voting, doesn't matter

o   He wants to destroy the party and see who can pick up the pieces on the 2nd, 3rd ballot

o   We're trying to work with Mitch McConnell in KY to put together a unity slate

o   We're working with party officials, we didn't want to go into a state in be disruptive, as Cruz did

o   We want to make sure people who Trump hasn't been exposed to know we're going to work with them

*         Trump said transgender people can use whatever bathroom they want (it would be discriminatory, expensive), but then Trump said it was state's rights. What does he think about NC law

o   He thinks what he said, that it's a states' rights issues

o   It's not a reversal

*         But 12 hours before he said leave it the way it is, no real problem there

o   Trump said what his personal opinion was, and then he said how he would handle it, called it state's rights issue

*         Trump foreign policy speech using teleprompters, are you trying to drag him kicking to be more presidential

o   It's not a new campaign, it's an expanded campaign

o   Trump had to establish legitimacy, win primaries, become presumptive nominee, all of which he did, now he's in next phase
