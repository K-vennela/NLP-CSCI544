Subject: DRAFT Ryan / Trump LTEs

Economy 1:

The Republican Establishment is struggling to come to terms with Donald Trump as their standard-bearer, claiming that he doesn't truly represent their values. But from the Donald's opposition to raising the minimum wage to his plan to cut taxes for the rich, Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are cut from the same cloth.

In addition to proposing Bush-like tax cuts for the rich, Trump's claims that the U.S. can never default on its debt because the treasury can always print more money demonstrates a dangerous cluelessness about how the economy works. His views that we can negotiate partial debt payments with foreign creditors is as reckless as it is inaccurate.

In Trump's world, that's business as usual. Trump's businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt, leaving investors, contractors and small businesses on the hook for his bad business decisions. We shouldn't subject the country's economy to Donald Trump's bankrupt business practices. The only deal to be had with Donald Trump is a bad one.

Economy 2:

The more I read about Donald Trump's tax proposals, the more I am terrified of a Republican presidency. These policies would hurt hard-working Americans like me, the way they did under Bush. Trump's tax plan would cost $9.5 trillion by slashing taxes for billionaires, while standing staunchly against a minimum wage increase. Trump even made the outrageous claim that wages were too high. His plans are the same, trickle-down tax plans that Speaker Paul Ryan has tried and failed to advance in Congress, in which the rich get richer at the middle-class's expense.

We shouldn't be surprised by the con that Trump and the GOP are running. The last Republican administration left our country in a recession, and this one would be no different.

Voters should not be fooled by Donald Trump's faux-populism. He has built his fortune by taking advantage of working people, and his tax plan would mean a big windfall for himself, once again giving middle-class families the short end of the stick.

Women's Health:

Donald Trump made his views about women's health crystal-clear when he said that there should be "some form of punishment" for women seeking an abortion. That's a terrifying thought when you consider that Republicans want Donald Trump to pick the next Supreme Court Justice.

But while Trump says he wants to punish women, Paul Ryan and Republicans in Congress are already doing it. Ryan has pushed an anti-choice agenda for years, including a partisan, political investigation of Planned Parenthood.

Instead of supporting policies that women actually want - equal pay and paid family leave - the Trump-Ryan Agenda prioritizes defunding Planned Parenthood and repealing the Affordable Care Act, showing how far the Republican Party has turned away from most Americans.

Each time we see Trump and Ryan actively fighting against women and families, we should be reminded that we need to keep a Democrat in the Oval Office come November.

Immigration:

When people act like Trump is engaging in a hostile takeover of the Republican Party - they're missing the point. Trump's radical positions and outrageous rhetoric on immigration didn't come out of nowhere. They were born out of years of inaction by Republicans in Congress, Speaker Ryan, who recently met with Donald Trump, has held up comprehensive immigration reform for years, and has instead poisoned the well on this issue.

Ryan might not call immigrants "rapists" or say that they are bringing "crime" or "drugs," but the sentiment is the same. It's not only discriminatory and counter-productive - but it hurts our economy. Comprehensive immigration reform would grow jobs and add to the domain.com, but Ryan and Trump are more concerned with scoring political points than fixing problems.

Americans deserve better than Ryan and Trump's fearmongering on immigration. We should reject both of these leaders at the ballot box in November.
