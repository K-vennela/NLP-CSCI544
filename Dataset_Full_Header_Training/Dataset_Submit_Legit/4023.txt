Smith Announces Opposition to FY2017 NDAA

Washington, DC - Today, House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam =
Smith made the following statement indicating his opposition to the FY 2017=
 NDAA:

"I have been extremely concerned about this bill's attempt to take $18 bill=
ion from Overseas Contingency Operations, setting up a funding cliff that p=
uts our men and women in the field at risk next year. This scheme degrades =
military readiness by taking funds out of OCO. It also sets the stage to br=
eak the budget agreement reached just last October, which will make it more=
 difficult to reach similar deals in the future that we will need in order =
to make necessary investments in our military, infrastructure, public healt=
h, and other critical priorities.

"Now, Republicans have used a procedural trick to overturn a decision by Me=
mbers of the House regarding women's equality in the Selective Service. The=
y have misused the rules process to avoid votes on women's equality, labor =
laws, and taxpayer-funded discrimination against LGBT individuals, while ad=
ding further restrictions on transfers from the Guantanamo Detention Facili=
ty, cutting funds for nuclear nonproliferation, and adopting a range of oth=
er highly problematic provisions. These have tipped the balance of the bill=
 considerably. I greatly appreciate the efforts of the majority to work wit=
h us on this bill, but unfortunately, without proper debate and vote by the=
 whole House on these national issues, it is no longer a product I can supp=
ort."
