Subject: DWS Interview Request

Hey, Gents.

Sam and I are working on a story for next week's issue about where the Democrats go next after we all felt the Bern. Is it possible that we can get the Chair for an interview? We could do in person or by phone-whatever is easiest for her. We've seen him-and his supporters-move the Party in a pretty significant way that could have re-allignment issues for a generation. The story will be a significant part of next week's magazine (read between the lines), which goes to print on Wednesday of next week.

Can we hop on the line to chat today?

Thanks,
Phil
