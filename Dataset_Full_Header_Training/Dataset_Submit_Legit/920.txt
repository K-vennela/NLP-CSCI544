Flagging "major announcement" from Cruz today at 4 PM. Could be a major endorsement, like Pence, or a VP announcement.

--

Last night was Donald Trump's night. Today is Indiana's day. Indiana has an opportunity to make a decision for the country.

I am thrilled that the people of Indiana will be making that choice. We're barnstorming the state.

We're making a major announcement at 4 PM.

Asked about what he looks for In a running mate, he or she should be prepared to step in.

Talks about how he'll be focused on jobs, freedom and security.

On Trump winning majorities last night - I recognize that the NY executives and the lobbyists want the campaign to be over. I recognize that Donald Trump did well at home. Donald Trump and HRC are flip sides of the same coin. Hillary Clinton has made millions selling influence, Donald Trump, billions, buying influence.

Hits Donald Trump for agreeing with Hillary on taxes and Obamacare.

Cruz: It'll be interesting to see what Trump will say in his FP speech. Calls on him to explain for support for wanting to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians. Also hits Trump for supporting the Iran deal.

Trump campaign is being run by a Washington lobbyist that lobbied for Saudi Arabia that opposed moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

Talks about how he messed up a basketball reference last night.

Cruz: The powerbrokers want this race to be over. They want this election to be between two rich Washington liberals.

People of Indiana have good judgment. Won't make the decision to get behind a NY liberal

Hits Trump for not wanting to debate. Also criticizes networks for not calling for debates.
