Manage Search Like a Pro with Ad Extensions

Ad Extensions do's and don'ts 

Hello Amy,

Ad extensions are becoming increasingly important in pay-per-click campaigns. How do we know this? Google & Bing have been placing more and more importance on ad extensions by encouraging their proper use. Though they are sometimes taken for granted, ad extensions allow paid search managers to provide additional content and resources alongside their ads—thereby gaining more real estate on the SERP. 
Are you using ad extensions to their fullest potential? Which extensions are best for your campaigns? Join Point It’s own Evelyn Baek and Chris Hoag as they explain the do’s and don’ts of ad extensions.
