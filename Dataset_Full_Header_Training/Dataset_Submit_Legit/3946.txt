Whether guilty of “human rights abuses,” a client like this gives us not only operational exposure that could negatively impact future sales, but also legal exposure. (FinFisher right now is the subject of a legal case in Pakistan.)  So option #1 provides the most protection for H.T.  We would at least have the defense that, once aware of the behavior, we moved to stop it.  While option 2 might be possible, it is hard for me to see how we could be assured of  successful outcome.  Especially true since this is now a second case of their ineptitude, so they remain worrisome.
