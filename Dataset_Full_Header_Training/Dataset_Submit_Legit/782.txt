Sample Trump Op-Ed

Divisive, Reckless and Dangerous: The Trump-Ryan Agenda is a Recipe for Dis=
aster
(Key Issues: Taxes, Economy, Women=92s Health, Immigration)

Donald Trump=92s recklessness would hurt our economy, diminish our standing=
 in the world, make our communities less safe, and leave the working famili=
es of [State] behind. He is divisive, dangerous, and he lacks the judgment =
and temperament to be president.

In states with Republican state leadership: Here in the state of [XXX], we =
already know the damage Republican leadership can do. Governor [XXX], and/o=
r the Republican-led legislature have implemented more of the same backward=
s policies from the Republican playbook. (state-specific examples) We need =
Democratic leadership to carry us forward.

In states with Democratic state leadership: Here in the state of [XXX], Gov=
ernor [XXX], and/or the Democratic-led legislature have fought for policies=
 that have expanded opportunity, protected civil rights and helped working =
families prosper. (state-specific examples)

What Trump is promising is what we already know we can expect from the GOP.=
 For years the Republican Party has elevated extreme voices, using divisive=
 campaigns that sought to domain.com unfounded fears for political gain. And d=
espite his best attempts at portraying himself as an independent outsider w=
ith new ideas, he has embraced the same disastrous, failed policies that to=
day=92s top GOP leaders, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, have long fought for=
.

A Trump presidency would advance Ryan=92s policies, erase the real economic=
 progress of the last seven years under President Obama, hurt  working fami=
lies, turn back the clock on women=92s health, and deepen divisions on immi=
gration reform.

Both Trump and Ryan would block an increase in the minimum wage. Both have =
vowed to defund or shutdown Planned Parenthood. Trump has made absurd claim=
s about building a =93great wall=94 on our southern border, while Ryan has =
voted repeatedly for building a border wall. Both have vowed to repeal the =
Affordable Care Act, which would jeopardize health care for 20 million Amer=
icans. And both men have proposed tax plans that would overwhelmingly benef=
it the rich and slash the top income tax rate to 25 percent.

Trump=92s tax plan would cost the country $9.5 trillion to implement =96 mo=
re than any other Republican plan proposed =96 while violating his own pled=
ge to eliminate the national debt.

This week as Trump and Ryan meet at RNC headquarters, presumably in an atte=
mpt to repair the damage of their vicious primary, it=92s a stark reminded =
that the Trump-Ryan agenda is a real threat, and that if we allow it to tak=
e hold over the next four years it would come at a severe cost for the vast=
 majority of Americans.

A Trump presidency would only drag us backwards. His campaign has damaged A=
merica=92s relationships across the globe. His record of denigrating women =
has only gotten worse throughout this campaign, and at the same time that h=
is divisive rhetoric has made our communities less safe. His business recor=
d is riddled with embarrassing failures that make it clear the American peo=
ple can=92t afford to let him get anywhere near the White House.

When the last Republican president left office, our economy was losing 800,=
000 jobs a month. The Trump-Ryan agenda is offering more of the same, or wo=
rse, and the American people cannot afford to let Trump bully his way into =
the Oval Office.

We need to elect more Democratic leadership from the top of the ticket down=
 to build on the progress of the last seven years under President Obama =96=
 with 74 straight months of private sector job growth, the longest streak o=
n record, and 14 million new jobs created. Republicans couldn=92t unite aga=
inst Trump and failed to stand up to him during their primary because they =
were playing to the same extreme base of their party. Democrats will be uni=
ted and hold Donald Trump accountable every day until Election Day on Novem=
ber 8th.
