Will New Round of Immigration Raids Dampen Latino Political Enthusiasm in 2=

Washington, DC =96 After news broke last week<<<link>>
160512175550-7ykq5/> that the Obama Administration was planning a new round=
 of immigration raids targeting young mothers and unaccompanied children fr=
om Central America, leading Democratic voices<<<link>>

aids/> and policy experts and advocates<<<link>>

 misguided on policy. Additionally, as leading observers are beginning to h=
ighlight, the planned raids also have a potentially damaging political effe=
ct.

Writing at Daily Kos last week, Kerry Eleveld had a must-read piece<<<link>>

Unfortunately, the raids are a prime example of Democrats not playing their=
 cards right. As a range of observers are noting, the planned raids have th=
e potential to undermine Latinos=92 sky-high motivation and enthusiasm duri=
ng a year in which Democrats cannot afford any drop-off in Latino enthusias=
m.

In a recent Salon column, progressive strategist Henry Fernandez noted<http=
://domain.com/2016/04/13/this_is_how_latinos_elect_donald_trump_why_demo=
crats_cant_coast_on_demographics_and_trumps_wall_in_2016/>, that while demo=

=93if Latino voters turn out at worse levels than what occurred in 2015 and=
 2012, it becomes much more likely that the Republican nominee will get ele=
cted president.=94 Fernandez then envisions the potential conditions =93und=
er which this Latino turnout drought could occur,=94 noting that, =93The Ob=
ama Administration would need to engage in deportation raids across the cou=
ntry primarily targeting Latino families and children =85 Grassroots organi=
zing and widespread coverage in Spanish Language media would make the raids=
 and the pain they create for families well known among Latino voters =85 T=
he raids would need to be blamed on the current Democratic president.=94

Mar=EDa Pe=F1a, Washington Correspondent for the nation=92s largest daily S=
panish-language newspaper La Opini=F3n, writes<<<link>>

 Voice), =93Election-year raids could affect Latino vote, activists warn,=
=94 quotes<<<link>>
rian-afectar-voto-latino-advierten-activistas/> Danny Cendejas of Detention=
 Watch Network, who says that even though many Latinos will vote against Tr=

vote and these raids are a scathing reminder of the lack of confidence on B=

And Gustavo Torres of CASA of Maryland and Virginia tells the Washington Po=

The announcement of the planned raids =96 and the immigration debate as a w=
hole =96 are not just abstract issues for millions of Latino voters across =
the nation. As data from recent Latino Decisions polling underscores, Latin=
o voters have a personal connection<<<link>>
14/6125/7781/AV_Wave_1_2016_Natl_Posted.pdf> to the immigration debate =96 =
57% of Latino voters know someone who is undocumented; one-third of Latino =
voters (34%) know someone who has faced deportation or detention for immigr=
ation reasons; and one-third of Latino voters (33%) know someone who has ap=
plied for DACA.

According to Frank Sharry, Executive Director of America=92s Voice, =93The =
planned raids are wrong as policy, abhorrent from a moral perspective, and =
potentially harmful to Democrats=92 political hopes this November. If the A=
dministration continues down this path it's up to Democrats in Congress and=
 advocates from across the country to demand a course correction.=94
