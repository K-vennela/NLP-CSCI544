Hillary Clinton:

Talks about having far more votes and pledged delegates

Sanders demands for rules changes and platform?
- We will talk with him and listen to him
- Will do my part to unify the party, and expect the same from him
- I did that in 2015 in a much closer race
- Far less differences between Sanders and I than with Republicans

California debate invitation?
- We will consider it
- Will stay focused on Trump because I will be the nominee
- Trump is not a normal candidate: attacking UK, meet with North Korea
- GOP businessman donor told me he was supporting me

Trump matchup?
- 2 million more votes than Trump
- He has plurality of Republicans
- No evidence he has ideas to make America great, just to make himself gree=
t
- Not running for anybody's third term, just my own first term

Big idea of your candidacy?
- We are stronger together
- Bipartisanship like 1990s

You are a polarizing figure. High unfavorables?
- Not as high as Trump
- I work across the aisle

Putting Bill Clinton in charge of economy?
- Will ask my husband who has a great track record
- Balanced budget and surplus in 90s
- Want to renegotiate NAFTA

VP qualifications?
- Somebody who you're sure can do the job as president

domain.com?
- Open to people who haven't served in elected office
- Business people with real success, not fake success
- Trump needs to release tax returns
