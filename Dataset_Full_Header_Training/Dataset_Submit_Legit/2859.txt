Good Friday morning, Illinois. The week closes out in Chicago with the prospect of a new power alliance in Chicago's City Council, Statehouse members forwarding a legislative package to their leaders and new audio of U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk emerges just as the campaign prepares a new ad targeted at opponent U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth. Let's start with City Hall. 

Today in POLITICO: "Weakened Emanuel invites potential power shift." "Is a new power front blowing through City Hall? At a time when Mayor Rahm Emanuel is seeing his grasp on power slipping, the leaders of three City Council caucuses are experiencing quite the opposite. Ald. Roderick Sawyer (Black Caucus), Ald. Scott Waguespack (Progressive Reform Caucus) and Ald. George Cardenas (Latino Caucus) - are meeting today in a first-of-its kind sit down. 

"Several sources confirmed to POLITICO that the three quietly arranged to meet to discuss potential avenues where their groups may be able to coalesce. The sources said there was no firm agenda for their lunch meeting but recent discussions have centered on ways to bring back the so-called traditional role of City Council, namely by empowering members. That talk has extended to the possibility of having the council name members to committees." <<link>> 

AUDIO: KIRK ACCUSES OBAMA OF TARGETING POLITICAL FOE -- "Kirk on tape: Menendez indicted for opposing Obama on Iran," in POLITICO: "U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., hasn't let up on his insistence that President Obama is using his power as president to lash out at a political enemy. At a fundraising event last month in Chicago, the Republican can be heard on audio defending indicted New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat. "And let me say something about Bob Menendez. I believe that Bob Menendez was indicted solely on the crime of opposing the President on Iran," Kirk is heard saying on a recording provided to POLITICO. Kirk made the remarks at an April 3 fundraiser in Chicago, featuring
 former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. They are the latest in a litany of controversial utterances by the junior Illinois senator who is locked in a tight reelection battle with U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill." <<link>>

DUCKWORTH CASE MOVES FORWARD -- "Judge allows workplace case against Duckworth to go to trial," by The Associated Press' Alan Scher Zagier: "A 7-year-old workplace retaliation domain.com against Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Duckworth will remain a campaign issue into the late summer after an Illinois judge said on Thursday that the case could go to trial before the November election.

MEETING THEM HALFWAY -- "Human Services Stopgap Swiftly Passes Both Chambers," NPR Illinois' Amanda Vinicky: "Illinois legislators today Thursday approved stopgap funding for human services.

PRAYERS ANSWERED -- "Prayer breakfast will be held, governor's office says," Bernard Schoenburg: "There will be a Governor's Prayer Breakfast this spring after all, Gov. Bruce Rauner's office said Thursday. The event is now planned to take place at the Executive Mansion on May 26. A spokesman for the volunteer organization that puts on the breakfast told The State Journal-Register Monday that the event was being postponed this year and was unlikely to take place - breaking an annual tradition that began in 1963. The governor's office told the newspaper Thursday that Rauner was disappointed that the event wasn't going to happen, so the office reached out to several local and statewide
 organizations to see if they would be willing to continue the tradition." <<link>> 

DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS -- "Rauner favors school funding reform, not Manar plan," by Pantagraph's Julia Evelsizer: "Gov. Bruce Rauner said Thursday he is 'cautiously optimistic' about changing how the state funds public schools, but not the reform package the state Senate approved on Tuesday. Rauner answered questions from the media during a domain.com to Normal Community West High School where he spoke of his support for adequate state funding for education. 'I need to study it (the Senate bill) in more detail, but on a preliminary basis it looks like it would cut most school districts' amount of state money significantly and it would increase Chicago's funding very significantly. If that's
 the outcome, I do not support it,' said Rauner." <<link>> 

HOT POTATO -- "Tax increase, budget cuts part of proposal submitted to Rauner, legislative leaders," State Journal-Register's Doug Finke: "Rank-and-file legislative negotiators have come up with a proposal to balance the state's budget with a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts.

RACIAL JUSTICE THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY -- "Teaming up for environmental justice," by Illinois Times' Patrick Yeagle: "The NAACP released a report last week calling for racial justice in Illinois' environmental policy, prompting a new alliance between groups concerned with civil rights, labor rights and pollution.

On May 5, the NAACP released its Illinois "Just Energy" report in Springfield, calling for environmental
 justice in the form of more renewable energy, better minority job representation and more. The group annually releases such reports for every state." <<link>> 

'THIS WAS AVOIDABLE' -- "Illinois Issues: Budget Crisis Could Have Been Averted Before The Current Standoff," by NPR Illinois' Jamey Dunn: "Last month, Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan stood in his chamber and delivered a speech on his perspective of the budget impasse. 'The fact is, the current budget crisis was completely avoidable. While this crisis was avoidable, Gov. Rauner has refused to put an end to the crisis,' Madigan said. The speaker is correct. This was avoidable. Many, including Madigan, are pointing the finger at Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner for tying budget negations to his so-called Turnaround Agenda, which includes anti-union provisions legislative Democrats say
 they cannot support. But this crisis was avoidable long before he took office and the current game of political chicken began." <<link>>

GRAPPLING WITH $1B CPS DEFICIT -- "Principals bracing to lose 20 percent in school budgets," by Chicago Sun-Times' Lauren FitzPatrick: "Chicago Public Schools has been bracing principals for school budget cuts of at least 20 percent for the upcoming fiscal year, the district acknowledged Thursday.

But 'the reality is scheduling or sharing of resources isn't going to close a

AT CPS, 'CULTURE OF FEAR' -- "Ousted CPS Principal Calls District Administration 'Inherently Corrupt,'" by NBC Chicago's Tom Schuba: "Embattled Chicago Public School principal Troy LaRaviere on Thursday maintained the charges levied against him by the district were aimed at silencing the vocal critic of Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

 newspaper, the Daily Targum." <<link>>

WHAT AWARDS CEREMONY OVERLOOKED -- "The Lisagors need rethinking," by The Reader's Michael Miner: "Now that this year's Lisagor Awards are behind us, the Chicago Headline Club needs to go back to the drawing board. The competition's guidelines are obsolete. While the Headline Club has tinkered with its categories in recent years to accommodate the rise of digital journalism, it's overlooked something basic: newspaper circulations have slipped so precipitously that the Lisagor's most basic distinction-between big metro dailies with print circulations above 250,000 and papers with circulations below that-finds the Tribune the only big paper still standing."
