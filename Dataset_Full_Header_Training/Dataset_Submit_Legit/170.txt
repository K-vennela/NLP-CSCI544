Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Paul Sancya/AP)

Chairing the Organization can't be all that Debbie Wasserm=
an Schultz had hoped it would. She's weathered slights and rebukes by the b=
arrel and gets virtually no domain.com for any electoral gains Democrats have m=
ade during her time at the top of the party.

And this week was particularly indicative of her tumultuous time as Organizationcha=
ir =97 and why the 2015 election can't come soon enough for her.

It all began last weekend when supporters of Bernie Sanders and backers of =
Hillary Clinton faced off at the Nevada state party convention<<<link>>
domain.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/15/heres-what-happened-at-saturd=
ays-dramatic-nevada-democratic-convention/>. At issue was the disqualificat=
ion of 50-plus Sanders delegates by state party chair Roberta Lange. The Sa=
nders people were not happy =97 and they got aggressive.

Wasserman Schultz went on CNN to blast Sanders for not directly condemning =
the actions of some of his supporters. "Unfortunately, the senator's respon=
se was anything but acceptable,"she told Wolf Blitzer<<<link>>
domain.com/video/2016/05/17/debbie_wasserman_schultz_what_happened_at_neva=
da_convention_was_unacceptable_sanders_added_fuel_to_the_fire.html>. "It ce=
rtainly did not condemn his supporters for acting violently . . . and inste=
ad added more fuel to the fire."

Suddenly, Wasserman Schultz was the story. Liberals =97 especially those al=
igned with Sanders =97 had long believed that the Florida congresswoman (an=
d the broader Organizationapparatus she helms) had been working stealthily to elect=
 Clinton even while maintaining neutrality in public.

"I don=92t think she was fair," liberal commentator Van Jones said of Wasse=
rman Schultz. "I think she actually made it worse now."

"Morning Joe" co-host Mika Brzezinski said Wasserman Schultz should resign,=
 alleging a long-standing favoritism for Clinton.

"This has been very poorly handled from the start,=94 Brzezinski said<https=
://domain.com/watch?v=3D0ftsRypMBQ8>. =93It has been unfair, and they =
haven=92t taken him seriously, and it starts, quite frankly, with the perso=
n that we just heard speaking [Wasserman Schultz]. It just does. . . . She =
should step down. She should step down.=94

Wasserman Schultz's week got worse. On Thursday, Clinton sat for an intervi=
ew with CNN in which she made quite clear that she'd had enough of Sanders =
in this primary race<<<link>>
/19/hillary-clinton-sent-a-very-clear-message-to-bernie-sanders-today-enoug=
h-is-enough/>, offering a not-so-subtle signal to the Vermont senator that =
it was time to go.

"Senator Sanders has to do his part,=94 Clinton said. =93That=92s why the l=
esson of 2008, which was a hard-fought primary, as you remember, is so pert=
inent here. Because I did my part.=94

Negotiating that detente is fraught with political peril =97 particularly g=
iven just how nasty the race got this past week. The responsibility to find=
 that brokered peace falls =97 at least in part =97 to Wasserman Schultz. W=
hich means she may well have a few more rough weeks in front of her.
