A step that could lead to an eventual embrace of the presumptive Republican=
 nominee

Top evangelical and social conservative leaders are planning a private meet=
ing with Donald Trump to see if they will be able to address longstanding c=
oncern about his candidacy.

Former presidential candidate Ben Carson is working with Tony Perkins, pres=
ident of the Family Research Council, and Bill Dallas, who leads United in =
Purpose, to plan a closed-door session for about 400 social conservative le=
aders to meet with Trump in the coming weeks in New York City. A broader st=
eering group of about 20 people includes people like American Values presid=
ent Gary Bauer, Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, and Family Leader=
 president Bob Vander Plaats.
=93We are looking for a way forward,=94 Perkins says. =93The main thing her=
e is this is to have a conversation.=94 He described the planned meeting as=
 =93a starting point for many.=94 The Trump campaign has not publicly confi=
rmed that the meeting will take place.

For many of the expected attendees at the event, Trump was not their first =
choice as a presidential candidates. With the exception of Carson, who has =
endorsed Trump, the event organizers were not supportive of Trump in the pr=
imary, says Perkins, who supported Sen. Ted Cruz. The event is expected to =
be a closed-door interactive forum for attendees to ask questions of the ca=
ndidate, likely in an interview format, not prepared speeches. This event i=
s also not intended to focus on rolling out endorsements. =93I don=92t even=
 know what it will lead to,=94 Perkins says. =93It is just to have an hones=
t conversation so that these leaders know what they need to do.=94

Trump campaign surrogates are separately organizing a more official faith a=
dvisory committee for the candidate, with Mike Huckabee being discussed as =
a possible national chairman. Televangelist Paula White, a Trump supporter =
and a senior pastor of New Destiny Christian Center in Florida, have been o=
rganizing the group behind-the-scenes with Tim Clinton, president of the 50=
,000-member American Association of Christian Counselors, according to seve=
ral people familiar with the project.

Trump=92s team meanwhile announced Wednesday that he would send a video mes=
sage to a conference of Latino evangelical leaders this weekend in Anaheim,=
 organized by Samuel Rodriguez Jr., the president of the National Hispanic =
Christian Leadership Conference. Hillary Clinton is also sending a video me=
ssage.

All of these moves signal an attempt to unite a social conservative base th=
at has been deeply fractured over the presumptive GOP nominee. Both the cam=
paign and the constituents groups are testing whether Trump can win their s=
upport despite division in the primary=97especially over Trump=92s public r=
efusal to ask for forgiveness, his past support for abortion, and his harsh=
 rhetoric about women and non-whites, all things that have left leaders of =
many large coalitions in the lurch.

The day after Trump became the presumptive nominee, for example, the lay Ca=
tholic organization Catholic Vote=97one of United in Purpose=92s partners=
=97called Trump too =93problematic in too many ways=94 to receive their end=
orsement, citing concerns over his moral judgment, his past support for abo=
rtion, and his lack of =93foundational principles from which he proposes to=
 govern.=94 The group said it would =93not necessarily=94 work actively to =
defeat Trump, but would turn its resources to critical Senate and House sea=
ts.

That is an issue Carson hopes to address with social conservatives. =93Dona=
ld Trump is pro-life,=94 Carson says of these types of concerns. =93Now he =
might not be quite as pro-life as I am, but he definitely believes in the s=
anctity of life, does not believe in abortion on demand. That is a misconce=
ption that people have.=94

Carson is facilitating the gathering as the chairman of MyFaithVotes, a non=
partisan effort to mobilize 25 million Christian voters this election cycle=
. Invitations to the meeting are being organized by Perkins, the founder of=
 the MyFaithVotes initiative Sealy Yates, and Dallas of United in Purpose, =
a 501c4 that helps conservative groups change American culture toward Judeo=
-Christian principles. United in Purpose has previously worked closely with=
 Perkins, and has several dozen partners, including groups like Americans U=
nited for Life, Concerned Women for America, Catholic Vote, and the Faith a=
nd Freedom Coalition.

The ideal event, says Carson, would be =93very similar to what happened a c=
ouple of weeks ago with Mr. Trump and people on Capitol Hill, getting an op=
portunity really to sit down face to face and interact with each other, and=
 that allays a lot of anxiety on both sides.=94

Ronnie Floyd, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, says Perkins ha=
s invited him to the meeting. The purpose is to have a conversation with Tr=
ump, says Floyd, =93to get to know him, and for him to get to know us=85who=
 we are and what we care about.=94 For Floyd, that includes Trump=92s domain.com=
ions on Supreme Court nominations, abortion and racial justice, and religio=
us liberty.

Until now, Trump has largely skirted the traditional evangelical political =
apparatus in Washington, instead relying on unusual surrogates like televan=
gelists to support his message among evangelicals. Whereas Jeb Bush approac=
hed Floyd, the Southern Baptist president, to meet last August, and Cruz vi=
sited Floyd=92s church and met with him after the service, neither Trump no=
r his campaign has not reached out to Floyd. =93As president of the Souther=
n Baptist Convention, I feel like if they had done their homework in relati=
onship to evangelical leaders, sooner or later, that I might receive a call=
 from them, but I have not received that yet,=94 Floyd says of Trump=92s te=
am.

Several other social conservative leaders interviewed by TIME said they are=
 just in the beginning stages of reaching out to the Trump campaign.

Penny Nance, president of the Concerned Women for America, says a campaign =
surrogate reached out in January to offer a group meeting with Trump. When =
Nance said she would only go if it were a substantive policy conversation, =
she said they were no longer interested, and they did not accept her offer =
for her to gather a team to really brief him on pro-life issues. CWA has ha=
lf a million members, a cohort of Republican women with a reliable ground o=
peration. =93This is my fear, I work to get my members to, first to go vote=
, and I urge everyone to do the things that we do to get our favorite candi=
dates to get elected, and all the hours and effort and money that people po=
ur into these candidates, and then you wake up the next morning and realize=
 it was all a ruse,=94 Nance says. =93I did everything I could do to blow u=
p the tracks in front of the Trump train, and it didn=92t work, and so at t=
his point you either jump on, or stand on the sidelines and wave.=94

Tom McClusky, vice president of March for Life Action, says =93there=92s a =
lot of concern=94 in the pro-life movement now that Trump is the likely GOP=
 nominee. In late April, Trump said he would add new exceptions to the Repu=
blican platform on abortion for rape, incest and life of the mother, raisin=
g big red flags for pro-life leaders. Lila Rose, president of the prolife e=
ducational domain.com Live Action, called on him to not =93dilute=94 the pla=
tform. Their fear with Trump is more than about just abortion. =93Our theme=
 for the March this year is that pro-life and pro-women go hand in hand,=94=
 McClusky says. =93Some of his statements have been, to put it mildly, miso=
gynist.=94

Chad Connelly, RNC=92s first-ever director of faith engagement, says he has=
 not yet talked with Trump, and has had only limited interaction with Trump=
=92s team. He is working a turnout operation on his own, a heavy lift given=
 the presumptive nominee=92s lack of evangelical strategy thus far. Connell=
y has so far visited 40 states, and has hired some part-time pastors that h=
elp in some states, focusing in Florida and Ohio. =93I think our segment is=
 the key this fall,=94 he says. =93It is the key.=94

Others like Ralph Reed, leader of the Faith & Freedom Coalition and a forme=
r senior advisor for the Bush-Cheney campaigns, are getting behind the pres=
umptive nominee. Reed was neutral in the primaries, and now tells TIME that=
 he will personally support Trump and do everything he can in his personal =
capacity to help Trump=92s campaign in the general.

Reed is planning for 2015 to be the largest voter education program of his =
career. His team will make 200 million voter contacts, directed at 32.1 mil=
lion faith-based voters primarily in battleground states like Iowa, Florida=
, North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and Ohio. His voter education program=
 budget is projected for $28 million, and will include one million door kno=
cks, 25 million pieces of mail, and on average 7 digital messaging impressi=
ons per voter. Operations like this are often the lifeblood for a successfu=
l voter outreach=97in 2014, Reed=92s 30-second videos earned an 80% complet=
ion watch rate.

=93[Evangelicals] don=92t necessarily vote for the candidate who is most li=
ke them in terms of religious identity, that is just a myth,=94 Reed says. =
=93If you understand they are issue driven, and it is a broad swath of issu=
es on with they vote, if you understand that they are not driven primarily =
by appeals to religious identity, then you understand why Trump did so well=
 in the primaries, and why he has the opportunity to over perform again in =
the general.=94

David Lane of the American Renewal Project is planning a prayer rally in Cl=
eveland the weekend before the Republican Convention begins. =93I=92m going=
 to choose to believe that Donald Trump can be one of the top 4 presidents =
in American history,=94 he recently wrote to his followers. =93We intend Ev=
angelical and Pro-Life Catholic Christians to bring biblical-based values t=
o the public square, bucking up a Trump Administration willing to confront =
totalitarian =91Political Correctness.=92=94

Republican turnout for the first 31 primaries was highest since at least 19=
80, according to the Pew Research Center, and about half of that has likely=
 been evangelical voters. Trump won a plurality of evangelical voters in th=
e Republican primaries, with Cruz finishing a strong second, according to e=
xit polls.
