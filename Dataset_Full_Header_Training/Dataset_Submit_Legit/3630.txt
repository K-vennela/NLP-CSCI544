OrganizationChair's Statement on Today's Primaries

WASHINGTON - OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following s=
tatement on today's primaries in Kentucky and Oregon:

=93With two more Democratic primary contests closed tonight in Kentucky and=
 Oregon, it=92s once again clear that our voters are excited and enthusiast=
ic about the future of our party, about building on the last seven years of=
 progress, and ready to hold Donald Trump accountable for the damage he=92s=
 done as a candidate and the damage he=92s promising he would do as preside=
nt.

=93In just the last week, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee,=
 has backpedaled away from his own pledge to release his tax returns, vowed=
 to slash taxes for those at the top like himself, faced questions about pr=
etending to be his own publicist, refused to address his well-documented hi=
story of misogyny, called his campaign=92s selection of a white supremacist=
 delegate a =91database error,=92 and insulted one of our country's most im=
portant allies. Every day it seems, the American people are discovering a n=
ew example of his recklessness, lack of judgment and unstable temperament. =
 That's why Democrats will head into the general election energized, unders=
tanding what's at stake and championing the values and priorities that matc=
h those of the American people. As we move closer to our convention and the=
 general election, it's clearer than ever we must elect a Democrat as our 4=
5th President."
