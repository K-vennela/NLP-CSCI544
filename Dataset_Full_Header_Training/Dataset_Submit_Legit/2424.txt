The Man Who Beat Donald Trump<<<link>>

REHOBOTH BEACH, Del.=97Sitting here the other day in the library of his hou=
se with 40 rooms, 11 fireplaces, four pianos, a wine cellar, a movie theate=
r and an elevator, Marvin Roffman talked about the time Donald Trump tried =
to destroy him for telling the truth.

=93Brutal,=94 said Roffman, 76, wearing loafers, khaki shorts and a pink po=
lo, his elaborate gardens and the sixth hole of the Kings Creek Country Clu=
b golf course visible through the windows.

=93I=92m telling you,=94 he said. =93Trump is a brutal guy.=94

This was March of 1990. Roffman was a veteran securities analyst. He had fo=
cused on the gaming industry in Atlantic City since the first casinos opene=
d in 1978. He knew the market as well as anyone and had watched closely as =
Trump made a typically bold entrance with Trump Plaza and Trump=92s Castle =
in 1984 and =9185. Now the New York real estate tycoon was about to open hi=
s third casino, by far his biggest, most lavish and most shakily financed o=
ne yet, the Trump Taj Mahal. Roffman was skeptical. He told a reporter from=
 the Wall Street Journal the Taj would fail.

What happened next was straight out of Trump 101. The =93people I don=92t t=
ake too seriously,=94 he had written in 1987 in The Art of the Deal, =93are=
 the critics=97except when they stand in the way of my projects.=94 Roffman=
 was in the way. Trump bombarded him with invective, threatened to sue his =
employer, demanded his firing and then publicly assailed him some more. Tha=
t Roffman=92s assessment was grounded in reality=97that he would prove to b=
e right=97didn=92t stop Trump from attacking Roffman. It was the reason for=
 it.

Three days after the quote in the Journal, Roffman was fired. What happened=
 after that, though, was unusual. In the long history of the leading Republ=
ican presidential candidate=92s use of disparagement, intimidation and forc=
eful warnings of litigation, there is no person quite like Roffman. He sued=
 Trump and won a clear victory=97a fat check drawn on a Donald Trump accoun=
t.

How does one beat Trump? For Roffman, it took time and money, gumption and =
conviction. Trump v. Roffman was a noisy, blustery harangue in the court of=
 public opinion. Marvin B. Roffman v. Donald J. Trump and Trump Organizatio=
n, Inc., on the other hand, was a longer, fact-based slog in an actual cour=
t.

=93If you have a brand that strong, associated with success, power and clas=
s, that brand name must never be tarnished, ever,=94 Roffman told me, attem=
pting to explain Trump=92s motive for trying to ruin the life and reputatio=
n of a person he knew was right. =93You must defend it. You must protect it=
. I was the monkey wrench in the gears. I was the monkey wrench threatening=
 the integrity of the brand.=94

Roffman smiled. =93I=92m glad I did it. Otherwise,=94 he said, =93I wouldn=
=92t be sitting here in this chair.=94

=93Marvin,=94 Trump said.

It was the middle of that March. =93I know you=92re down on the Taj,=94 Tru=
mp said over the phone from New York, according to Roffman=92s recollection=
.

=93He said, =91I want you to see this property in its full splendor,=92=94 =
Roffman recalled. =93=91I=92m going to have someone call you and arrange a =
tour of the Taj. And after the tour, I want you to call me. And I know what=
 you=92re going to tell me. You=92re going to tell me you have just seen th=
e greatest property ever.=92 I swear to God. That=92s what he said.=94

The tour was set for March 20.

That morning, the Journal ran an article about Trump and the much-anticipat=
ed early April opening of the 1,250-room, 120,000-square-foot Taj, which ha=
d 70 eye-catching minarets on its roof and a payroll of some 6,500 employee=
s. Roffman, then working for a Philadelphia brokerage firm called Janney Mo=
ntgomery Scott, was quoted prominently.

=93When this property opens,=94 Roffman told the Journal, =93he will have h=
ad so much free publicity he will break every record in the book in April, =
June and July. But once the cold winds blow from October to February, it wo=
n=92t make it. The market just isn=92t there.=94 He called Atlantic City in=
 general =93an ugly and dreary kind of place.=94

When Roffman arrived at the casino for his tour that day, Trump=92s brother=
, Robert, stopped him at the door and cursed him=97=93I=92d never heard so =
many four-letter words in my entire life,=94 Roffman told me at his house=
=97and yelled at him to =93get the fuck off the property.=94

Back in Philadelphia, on the fax machine at Janney=92s offices, a letter ar=
rived from Trump Tower.

Trump in the letter called Roffman =93hair-trigger=94 and =93somewhat unsta=
ble in his tone and manner of criticism.=94 He continued, without regard fo=
r spelling: =93For Mr. Roffman to make these statements with such definity =
is an outrage. I am now planning to institue a major domain.com against your f=
irm unless Mr. Roffman makes a major public apology or is dismissed. For a =
long while I have thought of Mr. Roffman as an unguided missle.=94

Roffman by this point had been a securities analyst for 25 years and at Jan=
ney for 16, developing a reputation as an outspoken, tell-it-like-it-is ana=
lyst. Trump had noticed, according to Roffman, calling on occasion to quiz =
him about competing casinos and other executives.

In 1987, Trump even had hired Roffman as an expert witness. In testimony in=
 front of New Jersey=92s Casino Control Commission, Roffman acknowledged th=
e =93tremendous risk=94 involved with the Taj because of its size and cost=
=97it was more than two years from completion=97but he also told the agency=
=92s members he was =93excited=94 about its prospects. He called Trump=92s =
first two casinos, the Plaza and the Castle, =93very efficient=94 and =93we=
ll managed,=94 according to a transcript of the hearing. He believed the Ta=
j, he said, could help finally revitalize the perpetually downtrodden small=
 city on the shore.

That fall, though, Wall Street crashed. The gaming industry started to stal=
l. Roffman grew pessimistic. He warned in a report for Janney clients in Ma=
y 1988 of =93Trouble Ahead With A Capital =91T=92=94=97a reference to Trump=
 and the Taj. =93Trump has only experienced an economy that is growing. Let=
=92s see how he does in a real turndown,=94 he told the Boston Globe that O=
ctober. =93Donald Trump=92s style is not cash, it=92s to borrow,=94 he said=
 in December to the Associated Press, noting that Trump now was shouldering=
 more than a billion dollars of debt just with his casinos. The Taj debt wa=
s $675 million in junk bonds, the only form of financing he could secure. F=
or the Taj to service its debt and simply break even, Roffman calculated, t=
he operation would have to take in around $1.3 million a day, unprecedented=
 in the history of casinos.

Throughout 1989=97in reports for clients, speeches to trade groups and conv=
ersations with reporters=97Roffman said versions or in some cases nearly wo=
rd-for-word previews of what would run in the Journal the following March. =
He even had said similar things earlier in the month in other high-profile =
publications. =93I have serious reservations about the financial success of=
 the Taj Mahal,=94 he told Newsday. Trump =93will have to do over steady ba=
sis something no other casino in the world has ever been able to do,=94 he =
told Newsweek. If Trump had been angered by these comments, he never compla=
ined privately to Roffman, nor did he bother to publicly rebut them.

It was the March 20 story in the Journal that triggered Trump=92s wrath.

He was on edge already.

=93I=92ve got some fabulous things,=94 Roffman says. | Matt Roth for Politi=
co Magazine

Trump at the time was the subject of relentless, tabloid-led coverage of th=
e disintegration of his marriage to Ivana Trump, the mother of his first th=
ree children, in part because of his affair with his younger, leggy mistres=
s, Marla Maples. For going on six weeks, the drama had been front-page fodd=
er for New York=92s tabloids. LOVE ON THE ROCKS. WAR OF THE TRUMP$. IVANA I=
N TEARS. MARLA RAGES!

Trump was asked by the New York Post if he considered adultery a sin. =93I =
don=92t think it=92s a sin,=94 he said, =93but I don=92t think it should be=
 done.=94

He told the Journal the crush of publicity about his personal life was actu=
ally good for his bottom line, citing 1,500 requests from reporters to cove=
r the opening of the Taj. =93A divorce is never a pleasant thing,=94 he sai=
d, =93but from a business standpoint, it=92s had a very positive effect.=94

It was a bluff. Almost everybody was fixated on his personal failings; almo=
st nobody knew the perilous state of his finances. Trump had racked up mass=
ive debt=97not only with his casinos, but in 1988, too, with a manic jag of=
 buying trophy properties<<<link>>
88-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721>, such as Manhattan=92s Plaza Hotel=
 and the Eastern Air Shuttle, which he renamed the Trump Shuttle. With the =
onset of a recession, it was becoming unsustainable.

=93He had to know it,=94 Roffman told me. =93But he didn=92t want anybody e=
lse to know it.=94

Hence the hostile letter.

The next day, Jim Meyer, Janney=92s director of research, detailed in an in=
ternal memo Roffman=92s punishments: He was to have =93no direct contact wi=
th members of the press,=94 no possibility of a bonus to his base salary in=
 1990 and a review of his employment status at the end of the year. Edgar S=
cott, the chairman of the board, called Trump, according to court records, =
informing him of the nature of the censure. He asked Trump what kind of apo=
logy he wanted. Trump, according to the records, directed that Roffman domain.com=
e him a letter saying the Taj would be =93the greatest success ever.=94 Rof=
fman didn=92t want to write a letter like that. His bosses did it for him. =
The obsequious letter said the opening of the Taj =93unquestionably=94 woul=
d be =93the grandest and most successful=94 in the annals of Atlantic City.=
 =93I do hope that you will let me continue to cover your companies,=94 it =
read. Roffman wanted to save his job. He reluctantly signed it. He was =93a=
 team player,=94 he said later in a deposition. =93I wanted to go long with=
 the firm because I liked working there.=94

After a sleepless night, Roffman got a call from Trump=92s secretary, accor=
ding to court records. Trump, she said, wanted him to make some adjustments=
 to the letter. He wanted, for instance, the phrase =93every hope that the =
Taj will ultimately be very profitable=94 changed to =93every expectation,=
=94 Roffman said. Roffman stewed. That afternoon, he wrote a new letter to =
Trump, a letter of his own.

=93I did not write the letter,=94 Roffman wrote. =93I retract the letter.=
=94

Roffman showed the letter to Meyer, according to court records, saying he w=
as going to send it to Trump. Meyer logged his response in an internal memo=
: =93Regarding the proposed attached letter to Donald Trump, after discussi=
on with senior management of our firm, we are directing you not to send the=
 attached letter to Mr. Trump while you are an employee of this firm. As lo=
ng as you remain an employee of ours we insist on the right to review and a=
uthorize all correspondence of yours related to anything or anybody associa=
ted with the casino industry.=94

Around 4:30, Roffman sent it, anyway.

Trump=92s response was quick and terse. =93Only a fool, a highly unstable o=
ne at that, would send a letter such as your second one negating your origi=
nal letter. You have proved by these strange and irrational actions to be a=
 great liability to your firm,=94 he wrote to Roffman. =93I look forward to=
 seeing you and your firm in court.=94 That was March 22.

Roffman was fired on March 23.

=93Because I wanted to tell the truth,=94 he told a United Press Internatio=
nal reporter.

Wrong, according to Janney. Roffman was let go, according to company docume=
nts, because he gave his opinion about the Taj in a quote to a reporter bef=
ore writing a report for paying clients=97a dubious assertion considering h=
e had been saying pretty much the same thing for weeks at least=97and =93fo=
r failure to follow his supervisor=92s direct instruction.=94

From Barron=92s to Fortune, from Institutional Investor to Vanity Fair, fro=
m the New York Post to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Trump in the wake of Roff=
man=92s firing unleashed a torrent of criticism against him, calling him =
=93a bad analyst,=94 =93a very unprofessional guy,=94 =93a totally mediocre=
 guy with no talent,=94 =93not a good man,=94 =93a man of little talent,=94=
 and =93a disgrace to his profession.=94

=93I have a right to be a critic of a critic,=94 Trump said to Institutiona=
l Investor.
