Subject: RE: Press events re: this week=E2=80=99s Trump/Ryan meeting

Hey folks,

Thanks very much to the state parties who held press conferences or otherwi=
se achieved media hits using the Trump-Ryan meeting hook. We want to encour=
age more of these events moving forward. To be clear, the hook can and shou=
ld be localized as much as possible, so you can adjust our templating to ma=
ke it relevant to your markets.

On Monday, we=E2=80=99ll be sending out some messaging related to National =
Infrastructure Week and we=E2=80=99ll be asking you to think about how you =
can use that hook to put on pressers and achieve TV and print hits in your =
markets. On Friday of next week, the NRA is having its Leadership Forum wit=
h Trump, Rubio, McConnell, Ryan, and others. Hope you can start thinking ab=
out those two hooks over the weekend for events next week.

Here are a few of the great clips we=E2=80=99ve seen from events this week:

Subject: [COMMUNICATIONS] Press events re: this week=E2=80=99s Trump/Ryan m=
eeting

Hey everyone =E2=80=93

Tomorrow, Donald Trump is coming to Washington D.C. to meet with Paul Ryan,=
 Reince Priebus, and Mitch McConnell. The Ryan meeting is the highlight bec=
ause Ryan has withheld his endorsement of Trump thus far. This is an ideal =
opportunity to highlight the historic mess that is the Republican Party, wi=
th the Speaker of the House of Representatives not ready to fully endorse h=
is Party=E2=80=99s nominee, and a slew of former GOP presidential candidate=
s, former Republican presidents and vulnerable Senate and House candidates =
trying to distance themselves from their standard bearer.

We=E2=80=99re asking state party communications directors to put together e=
vents around Thursday morning=E2=80=99s Trump-Ryan meeting to deliver the m=
essage that while Trump and Ryan may have a personal disagreement, they are=
 both pushing the same divisive and dangerous agenda. We=E2=80=99re also as=
king state party communications directors to echo these events with op-eds =
and letters to the editor in local papers, and surrogates on television and=
 radio.

Attached please find a packet with materials to put together an event. In t=
his packet you=E2=80=99ll find:

=C2=B7         Sample talking points / message guidance

=C2=B7         A sample advisory

=C2=B7         A sample press release

=C2=B7         A sample op-ed

=C2=B7         Four sample letters to the editor
Organizationcan offer national surrogates to appear via satellite or phone on local=
 television and radio broadcasts to amplify the message. Please reach out t=
o user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com> if you would like to book one of ou=
r surrogates. Members of Congress and Senators who are currently in Washing=
ton can also use our studio to do local hits.

Here=E2=80=99s what we=E2=80=99re looking for in terms of event logistics:

=C2=B7         Types of speakers:

o   State Party Chairs, Vice-Chairs, and EDs

o   Local Elected Officials

o   Allied Groups =E2=80=93 Planned Parenthood, NAACP, Mi Familia Vota, etc=
.

o   Labor

o   People sharing personal stories

=C2=B7         About 15-20 supporters

=C2=B7         Signs that say =E2=80=9CReject the Trump-Ryan Agenda=E2=80=
=9D =E2=80=93 we have a mockup that can be found here<Trump-Ryan-Sign.pdf>.

=C2=B7         A big push to get local TV to the event =E2=80=93 studies sh=
ow that local TV is the dominant player in most markets and Americans trust=
 local TV news about 20 points more than they trust national TV news.
The Republican Party has elevated offensive policies and extreme voices usi=
ng divisive campaigns for years, and now they=E2=80=99re stuck with Donald =
Trump=E2=80=99s reckless and dangerous campaign heading into the general el=
ection. We have to make sure we hold Republicans in Congress and in every s=
tate accountable for their Party=E2=80=99s dysfunction as they chaotically =
tumble toward the general election.

And while Republicans argue, Democratic voters are overwhelming in agreemen=
t that our primary has been exciting, and large majorities would support ei=
ther one of our candidates.

This meeting is also a reminder that what Trump has promised and what Repub=
licans up and down the ballot have pushed for is the same brand of trickle-=
down economic policies that help those at the top while costing hardworking=
 Americans. It=E2=80=99s the same old Republican playbook of cutting taxes =
for the rich at the expense of middle-class families, opposing measures lik=
e equal pay and paid family leave, and reckless policies that would only to=
 drag America back into a recession<<<link>>
hive/2016/05/donald-trumps-economy/481743/>. We can=E2=80=99t afford to go =
back to losing 800,000 jobs a month as the last Republican president left o=
ffice.
