Here it is with a minor domain.com. Should I send this to Tapper to air with the =
piece or domain.com until we are asked?

I am so proud to serve the people of Florida's 23rd district and I am confi=
dent that they know that I am an effective fighter and advocate on their be=
half in Congress.  Even though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent I r=
emain, as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the Presidential Democ=
ratic primary and I look forward to working together with him for Democrati=
c victories in the fall.
