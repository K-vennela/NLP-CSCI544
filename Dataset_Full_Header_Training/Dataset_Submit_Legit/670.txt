Hi All,

Please see attached for our $33,400 convention package level. THIS IS NOT FOR MASS DISTRIBUTION. The purpose of this package is to bring in new max out checks that we would not otherwise get. Please do not go back to folks who maxed out in previous years and offer to them.

Please come to Dan or I with any questions.

Thank you!

Rachel
