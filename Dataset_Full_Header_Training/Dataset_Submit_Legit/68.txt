Trump On Rich Zeoli Show:

PA jobs being decimated

-          Bring back clean coal

-          Bring back manufacturing

Tiffany and Don went to school in PA

You said you're a free trader?

-          Totally supportive of free trade, but the rest of the world rips us off

-          NAFTA was a horrible deal, especially in New England and PA

-          "You look at what NAFTA did. Now they're working on the Trans Pacific Partnership, which is going to be even worse and they just can't let it happen. I told all of my supporters-we have tremendous support in Washington-I said, 'Delay that thing so we can kill it."

-          Hillary will be the worst on trade

-          Her husband signed NAFTA

Kasich and Cruz colluding?

-          I thought it was interesting because they hate each other

-          Kasich is one for 38

-          Rigged system with the delegates

-          So many delegates that are so pro-Trump that I think they will protect us all

You're probably going to win popular vote in PA?

-          Moral obligation for delegates to cast vote on first ballot for the person who won

Would you support Cruz as the nominee?

-          Will make that determination at the time

Kasich?

-          Only won one state

-          Stubborn guy

-          Says he can beat Hillary, but hasn't faced any negative ads

-          Kasich was a proponent of NAFTA which destroyed PA

Message to Cruz voters?

-          He lies. And I don't say that easily

-          Says I won't build the wall, just makes things up
