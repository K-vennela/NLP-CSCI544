Smith Statement on Republican NDAA Provision Attacking LGBT Rights

Washington D.C. - Congressman Adam Smith released the following statement a=
bout the Russell amendment attacking LGBT rights that was included in the F=
Y 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. During mark-up of the NDAA in co=
mmittee, Democrats fought against efforts to expand religious organizations=
' ability to conduct 'taxpayer funded discrimination' against LGBT individu=
als, women, and other groups.

"The language in the Russell amendment is a direct attack on LGBT rights. T=
he president issued an executive order prohibiting discrimination based on =
sexual orientation or identity by government contractors. The Russell amend=
ment tries to override this executive order by artfully claiming to protect=
 'religious freedom,' but just like similar efforts in numerous state legis=
latures, this is actually an effort to promote discrimination. The language=
 tries to protect the so-called 'right' to get government contracts and gra=
nts and still discriminate against people whose lifestyle you don't approve=
 of. Government-funded discrimination is wrong under any circumstances, and=
 we certainly shouldn't be trying to expand it in a defense policy bill."
