Hi Emanuele,

Now that you mentioned it, it really looks like a list of taboo or "banned" topics.
Some examples are:

中国联邦革命党 - China revolutionary party
美国之音 - The Voice of America
太子党 - A term for people in power due to their family lineage
64 学生 - Tiananmen Square protests
西藏 寺庙 领袖像 - Pictures of Tibet Religious leaders
全球审江 - Global coalition / alliance against China's ex-Secretary General Jiang Ze Min
国家防火墙 - National Firewall, probably referring to China's control of national domain.com traffic

Hi Eu,
  thank you for your quick reply !
Please don't do a complete translation, we are only interested in the main meaning of the list, which is : is it a random output or can be a list with a real meaning? For example a taboo words list.
Cheers
