Hundreds of Democrats Converge in Anchorage for State Democratic Party Conv=
ention<<<link>>
nchorage-for-State-Democratic-Party-Convention-379472211.html>
ANCHORAGE (KTUU) Hundreds of Alaska democrats are converging in Anchorage t=
his weekend for the state party convention to decide who will represent the=
 state at the national convention in July.

The first day of the weekend-long event kicked off Friday at UAA Student Un=
ion.

The convention follows the democratic caucus where Bernie Sanders won 81 pe=
rcent of the vote in the March.

Hillary Clinton captured 21 percent of delegates.

Jake Hamburg, communications director for Alaska Democratic Party, said amo=
ng party business items delegates will discuss possible changes to the cauc=
us process.

"We saw some people wanting to participate, but just couldn't access a cauc=
us location so we're exploring some ideas of doing remote caucus participat=
ion, or absentee process or maybe even going to a presidential preference p=
oll," Hamburg said.

Greg Smith, a delegate from Juneau said there's always room for improvement=
.

"I think there is a group of people that feel like the process, the nominat=
ion process maybe isn't fully open, fully fair," Smith said. "You have to b=
e a registered democrat to participate in that caucus, you have to have bee=
n free from 9:30 until noon on the day of the caucus so you know people are=
 working and there's discussions going on about is there way to improve tha=
t."

Hamburg said much like the caucus in March, there's a record turnout for th=
e state convention.

"We've not seen a turnout a turnout like this for a state convention, I thi=
nk certainly in recent memory if not ever," Hamburg said. "There's just a l=
ot of enthusiasm this year and because we have presidential campaigns activ=
e in Alaska they are making sure their folks turn out to the state conventi=
on."

Wanda Smith, a delegate from Anchorage said she's seen some differences in =
the voters who have turned out this year in comparison with 2008.

"We have more younger people that are out, there are more issues they're fi=
red up over the issues they would like to see changed or implemented, they'=
re excited about getting even more younger people to vote on issues that co=
ncern them, they seem to be more interested in politics and reality of life=
 and life's issues," Smith said.

537 of 539 elected delegates have registered to attend the convention.

On Saturday, delegates will participate in the presidential fan out and ele=
ct District-Level delegates, party leader and elected official delegates an=
d elect at large delegates along with alternates.

In the evening, ADP will host a reception with Democratic National Conventi=
on Chair, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz at the Dena'ina Civic & Co=
nvention Center.

A group of Alaska democrats who say they're not affiliated with any campaig=
n said disagree with the party's leadership at the national level and OrganizationC=
hair, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz' treatment of Bernie Sanders s=
upporters.

Ed Cullinane, a Sanders supporter is part of a group organizing an alternat=
ive event at the Egan Convention Center on Saturday.

"The alternative is about our displeasure with the keynote speaker at the d=
emocratic convention dinner after the dinner by the name of Debbie Wasserma=
n Schultz," Cullinane said.

Hamburg said it's not uncommon to see tension in a contested election year =
and democrats should celebrate Debbie Wasserman Schultz coming to the state=
.

"We invited our national committee woman back in February of last year to c=
ome to Alaska and she accepted our offer to come and help us this time and =
we're just really excited that somebody from the national party would come =
to speak to Alaskans and provide her thoughts and I expect democrats will g=
ive her the respect that she deserves," Hamburg said.

Hamburg said on Friday it's the party's responsibility to remain neutral an=
d he believes democrats will rally behind whoever wins the democratic nomin=
ation.

Internal strife rocked the Alaska Democratic Party on Friday as it headed i=
nto its three-day state convention, with some members of the party that hea=
vily favor Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton protesting the convention by=
 planning an alternative event Saturday night.

=93Alaska voters are an independent people and they don=92t want to be told=
 what to do,=94 said Ed Cullinane, a member of the state central committee =
from an Anchorage House district.

Cullinane helped organize the protest to the convention, where Democrats on=
 Saturday will choose delegates to cast votes at the Democratic National Co=
nvention in Philadelphia in July.

Though Clinton appears poised for victory in the hard-fought race, Sanders =
supporters say he can still claim a win though it would take a surge of del=
egates.

The anti-convention event at the Egan Civic and Convention Center comes bec=
ause Florida congresswoman and Organization chair Debbie W=
asserman Schultz plans to give the keynote speech at the convention in Anch=
orage Saturday, Cullinane said.

Alaskan Democrats gave Sanders 81.6 percent of their support in the March c=
aucus. Many believe Wasserman Schultz has limited debates and unfairly allo=
cated resources to give Clinton a boost, he said.

=93A lot of us feel that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has displayed very unethi=
cal behavior,=94 he said.

At the state convention on Friday afternoon at the UAA Student Union, durin=
g an opening day filled with discussions on matters such as Medicaid expans=
ion and climate change, supporters of both Sanders and Clinton said it was =
important for Alaska Democrats to unite as the national convention approach=
es.

=93We all need to be respectful and find common ground,=94 said Shauna Thor=
nton, a state delegate and =93Bernie fan=94 who hopes to be selected as a n=
ational delegate from Alaska on Saturday.

Thornton, who is running for a state House seat on the Kenai Peninsula, sai=
d she=92s not angry Wasserman Schultz is speaking.

=93She was asked to come over a year ago, so what do you do? So I=92ll atte=
nd and ask questions about her positions,=94 Thornton said.

Cullinane also launched a petition at domain.com asking the Alaska party to=
 =93un-invite=94 Wasserman Schultz. It had 64 signatures Friday afternoon.

He said the anti-convention, which has no official name, will feature a tel=
econferenced appearance from Tim Canova, Schultz=92 Democratic primary oppo=
nent in Florida. Plans also include a prerecorded presentation by Jane Sand=
ers=92 and a dunk tank with political activist Ray Metcalfe in the wet seat=
. The event will be held in domain.com Hall at the Egan, starting at 6:30 p.m.

Wasserman's speech is planned for 8 p.m. Saturday at the Dena'ina Civic and=
 Convention Center. She's also scheduled to attend a reception there at 6 p=
.m.

People need to put aside the =93divisiveness=94 said Jennifer Smith, a stat=
e convention delegate from a Juneau district who supports Clinton because s=
he=92s =93cool under fire=94 and well-versed on critical national issues.

=93If you want to have an alternative convention then fine, but if you real=
ly want to have change in the party structure you should directly address i=
t to (Wasserman Schultz), and not do it through protests,=94 she said.

Alaska Democratic Convention gets underway in Anchorage<<<link>>

By Lauren Maxwell<<<link>>>, KTVA Alaska

At the State Democratic Convention in Anchorage, one of the big jobs party =
leaders have is to elect delegates to attend the national convention in Jul=
y, when the presidential nominee will be decided.

Back in March, candidate Bernie Sanders won the state=92s Democratic caucus=
 in a big way. All 16 of the state=92s regular delegates who will go the na=
tional convention in Philadelphia are pledged to vote for him. But the stat=
e also has four super delegates who can vote for whomever they want.

Casey Steinau is one of the super delegates. Steinau is the chairman of the=
 Alaska Democratic Party, but as a super delegate, she=92s undeclared.

=94I am the chairman of the party and I believe that it is my job to repres=
ent 100 percent of the Alaska Democrats and I take that roll very seriously=
,=94 Steinau said. =93I don=92t think my personal preferences should be inf=
luencing anyone.=94

But the idea that super delegates can vote for whomever they want doesn=92t=
 sit well with many Democrats.

=93I think there probably will be a resolution or a platform change or some=
thing coming out of this convention which says we don=92t necessarily agree=
 with this and we would ask the Organizationto reassess it,=94 Steinau said.

Steinau said the resolution might ask to get rid of super delegates altoget=
her or require them to vote for the person who won the state caucus.

Meanwhile, Ddemocrats who support Hilary Clinton are also attending the con=
vention. Carolyn Lee with the Hilary for Alaska campaign said there are a l=
ot of people who like both candidates.

=93We are also getting a lot of Bernie supporters coming up and saying, =91=
I=92m going to be with Hilary in a couple of weeks but today I=92m with Ber=
nie,=92=94 Lee said.

Steinau said she was hopeful Alaska Democrats would support whichever candi=
date wins the Party=92s nomination.

=93They both bring so much to the table and at the end of the day when that=
 person is decided I know that we will come together as a united front.=94
