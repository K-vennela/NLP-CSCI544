Dear OrganizationMember,

Republicans had another rough week with Ted Cruz and John Kasich's anti-Trump agreement falling apart within 24 hours<<<link>>>, and Ted Cruz announcing<<<link>>> that his running mate will be Carly Fiorina, who is best known for almost shutting down a great U.S. company, Hewlett-Packard. While the Republican Party continues to be divided, Democratic voters are energized. domain.com polls continue to show<<<link>>> that Democrats are proud of their candidates. In a statement<<<link>>> on Tuesday night's primary results, OrganizationChair Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a statement said, "It's no surprise that at domain.com polls in contest after contest, more and more Democratic voters are reporting that our primary process has energized our party, while more and more Republicans report deep, dispiriting divisions in theirs."

Donald Trump continues to prove that on foreign policy, he lacks the judgement, experience, and temperament to be our next commander-in-chief. On Wednesday, Donald Trump's foreign policy speech failed to impress<<<link>>> foreign policy experts and US Military Leaders are "terrified"<<<link>>> at the idea of Trump as President. His uninformed and inflammatory remarks throughout the course of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination have caused condemnation and worldwide alarm<<<link>>> among foreign leaders and policy experts. Ahead of this weekend's White House Correspondents' Dinner, our Factivists released a video reliving be sure to relive<<<link>>> the moment at the Correspondent's Dinner five years ago, where the President exposed Donald Trump as a fraud. "Five years ago, President Obama exposed Donald Trump as a fraud," said OrganizationPress Secretary Mark Paustenbach, "Trump's foreign policy address yesterday was further evidence the GOP frontrunner is no more qualified for the presidency today than when he was negotiating disputes between Lil' John, Meatloaf, and Gary Busey on Celebrity Apprentice."

Also this week, the continual assault on LGBT Americans by Republican legislators and governors through Right to Discriminate laws have stoked fear and prejudice. This has started to alienate<<<link>>> even prominent Conservatives. Take a look at what what they and others, including OrganizationNational Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach, have to say on this important issue here<<<link>>>.

Finally, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe passed an executive action this week restoring the voting rights of former convicted felons who have paid their dues to society. This was applauded<<<link>>> by OrganizationVice Chair Donna Brazile, who said, "Democrats across the nation believe the right to vote is our most fundamental right - it is the right that protects and preserves all of our other rights and freedoms. Democrats also know that we solve our nation's problems with more democracy, not less." Governor McAuliffe's action reaffirms the commitment of the Democratic Party to actively fight to expand voter access across the country.

Have a safe and happy weekend.
Best,
Stephanie
