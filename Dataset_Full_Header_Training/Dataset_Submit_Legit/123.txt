Dear Colleagues,
I would like to clarify the process to communicate unavailability (e.g., illness, personal impediments) or ask for vacations.Kindly follow this indications to avoid misunderstandings.
1. If you are asking for vacation/leave, check with Alessandro for the period you intend to ask. Alessandro will approve or negate based on the planned activities;2. in any case, vacation or unavailability must be promptly communicated to user@domain.com
Please mind that this communication is specific for you who are not resident in Italy.
Thanks for your cooperation,Daniele
