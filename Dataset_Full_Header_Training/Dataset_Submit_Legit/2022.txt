Fox & Friends:

-          Usual claim that lots of past critics are privately calling wanting to endorse

-          Says he has talked to Rubio, praises him as a guy with a great future

-          Comments on Jindal saying he would support Trump: "He came a long way back"

-          Won't give names for VP
