ial campaign as Democratic hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are =
taking turns pushing the disability agenda &ndash; a first for any presiden=
tial campaign.

Five states - Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Islan=
d - head to the polls tomorrow and candidates on both sides of the aisle ar=
e pulling out all the stops to up their delegate counts.

The disability vote can play a large part in that.

Fully one-out-of-five voters Americans (56 million) has a disability and 52=
 percent of likely voters have a loved one with a disability so if any cand=
idate wants to be elected president of the United States, they are going to=
 need the votes of people with disabilities. Presidential candidates need t=
o work for all of us. They need to represent all of us.

Both Clinton and Sanders were quick to complete the #PwDsVote 2015 Campaign=
 Questionnaire. Neither of the leading Republican candidates have responded=
 to our numerous requests to fill out the questionnaire (though Ohio Gov. J=
ohn Kasich has answered some of the questions).=20

RespectAbility is nonpartisan and does not endorse candidates. The question=
naire is purely for educational purposes as voters go to the polls. Its gro=
undbreaking publication, The RespectAbility Report <<link>>

itics and disability, and has covered 100 percent of the candidates on both=
 sides of the aisle. Their reporters are people with disabilities themselve=
s, and people who care deeply about disability issues.=20

Please take a look at some recent coverage of the candidates on a variety o=
f disability issues from subminimum wage to the Disability Integration Act =
and more.Thanks,

&ldquo;When it comes to jobs, we&rsquo;ve got to figure out how we get the =

 raise the minimum wage for all workers &ndash; including people with disab=

&ldquo;This campaign is about building on these successes so that everyone =

they support the monumental bill introduced by Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) =
that would greatly affect the lives of people with disabilities.

&ldquo;In this campaign, I have committed to improving opportunities for pe=

Later that day, Sanders signed on as a cosponsor of the DIA, which will ens=

Then, Kasich was approached by members of ADAPT who asked the governor to a=
