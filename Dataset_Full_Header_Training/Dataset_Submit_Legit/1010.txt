In more news from Ohio, the Legislature today passed online voter registration.  Like Florida, it will not become effective until 2017.  Ohio has allowed citizens to update their voter registration online for several years and that function will continued to be offered leading up to the November election.

Here is the story from the Columbus Dispatch.  <<link>>

In the domain.com brought by ODP and others, a federal district court has held that the Ohio legislature's elimination of "Golden Week" violates both the 14th amendment of the Constitution and section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.   This is a big win.

Perkins, the campaigns and our team are still reviewing the decision.
