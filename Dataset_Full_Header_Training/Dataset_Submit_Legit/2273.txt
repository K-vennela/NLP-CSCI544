Smith Statement Denouncing Hateful Rhetoric

Washington D.C. - Congressman Adam Smith released the following statement c=
ondemning hateful and violent rhetoric:

"Disturbing statements from the Republican White House contender cannot go =
unaddressed. America must stay true to its founding principles by standing =
with immigrants and leading on refugee resettlement. Our American values em=
brace people of all faiths and backgrounds. Fear cannot cloud our judgement=
, drive policy, or destroy our country's fabric. The Republicans are presen=
ting a very different vision for our country.

"Here in the Puget Sound region we have seen firsthand the damage that hate=
ful and violent rhetoric inflicts on our local community centers and places=
 of worship. We know that our region's diversity is one of our greatest str=
engths. Instead of hateful and violent words, we should stay true to our va=
lues and work together to build a more just and peaceful society. We know t=
hat immigrants and refugees strengthen our communities, our economy, and ou=
r country's future. Throughout our history, refugees and immigrants have ma=
de America great and will continue to do so."
