Trump creating committees to raise big money for GOP
By Alex Isenstadt and Kenneth P. Vogel

Donald Trump, facing calls to mend the rift he created in the Republican Party, is putting the final touches on two separate fundraising committees that will allow him to domain.com massive checks to help the GOP candidates with whom he'll share the November ballot, according to three sources familiar with the plans.

Trump's presidential campaign is poised to form a joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee and at least 10 state parties, according to the sources. That committee would be able to accept maximum checks of at least $136,100 per person

Plans call for a second joint committee that would include the Trump campaign and the GOP's two congressional campaign committees - the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the sources. That committee would be able to accept maximum checks of at least $69,500 per person.

The sources, who declined to be identified discussing ongoing negotiations, said they expected the joint fundraising agreements to be finalized this week.

The creation of the joint fundraising committees comes as Trump and the Republican Party are taking steps to mend the wounds left by a contentious primary during which the anti-establishment candidate repeatedly called out the GOP's leaders and donors - sometimes in deeply personal terms.

Officials from the Trump campaign, the RNC, the NRSC and the NRCC declined to comment on the joint fundraising committee negotiations.

But the creation of the committees will represent a formal about-face from the billionaire candidate's primary campaign boasts about self-financing his White House bid. His lack of investment in fundraising has left Trump scrambling to lay the groundwork to raise $1 billion for a general election campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton's well-funded political machine.

Clinton created an unprecedented joint fundraising committee with the Organization and 32 state party committees that can accept checks as large as $356,100. The Hillary Victory Fund, as the group is known, has helped Clinton raise $213.5 million for her campaign and more than $46 million for the Democratic Party through the end of April.

Trump, by contrast, had brought in $49 million through the end of March, $36 million of which had come from loans from his own pocket. The joint fundraising committee with the RNC and the state parties would help the party build get-out-the-vote operations in key states that would domain.com Trump and other Republicans on the ballot, who some party leaders feared could be harmed by a Trump-led ticket.

The massive joint committees were legalized by a 2015 Supreme Court decision called McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission that struck down aggregate limits on total giving to federal campaigns. That allowed wealthy donors to donate to as many candidates, party committees and PACs as they want, paving the way for joint fundraising committees including many more committees.
