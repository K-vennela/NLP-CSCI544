Looks like there=92s some nice open spaces so you should be able to catch u=
p on things.

10:00am: Senior Staff meeting
3:00pm: Meet Gustavo Arnavat (not sure where)

Senior staff schedule:

  *   SCOTUS Update
  *   2015 Planning
  *   Department Updates
  *   Operations Updates

Also, I asked Marilyn, Miles, and Bridgette about the Young Democrats of Am=
erica Hispanic Caucus, and they said it is not an official part of the Organization=
but they would recommend doing the call. They said =93we treat them like an=
y other allied group.=94 Let me know if I should reach out to schedule, or =
if you=92d like to pass it to Pablo.
