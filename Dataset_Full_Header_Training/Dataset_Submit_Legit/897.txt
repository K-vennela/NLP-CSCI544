Made minor tweaks.  Thanks, research, for checking out this version.

SL: The =93King of Debt,=94 Donald Trump and the GOP on the Economy

In less than a week since becoming the GOP=92s presumptive nominee, Donald =
Trump has already exposed himself as reckless and dangerous on the American=
 economy. His comments over the last few days promise to undermine  the rol=
e of the United States as a major economic power and potentially threaten t=
he global financial system. While his stances mimic those of Republicans in=
 Congress, they often go further and are more irresponsible than those of h=
is counterparts in the House and Senate.
