Know it's end of April $$ from Bill, but both interested in attending RT.  =
If schedule doesn't conflict with other evening dinner event he has to atte=
nd, Bill wants to go.  Jane committed to max as well.  I just need to lock =
her in for May.  Will tell her all contributions have to be in for May to g=
o.

Re her family photo request (only her and Bill staying for RT itself), what=
 do you think?  She asked what extra contribution would be involved beyond =
her max out.

Don't need an answer today but next couple days would be great so Bill can =
lock in schedule and Jane can consider extra contribution.  I know that's a=
n extra request to the White House for the family greet and photo (and not =
a guarantee they'll say yes), so thanks for any push on this.
