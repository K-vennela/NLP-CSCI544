Cato Institute=2C 1000 Massachusetts Ave.=2C NW=2C Washington=2C D.C.
For the past two decades Democratic and Republican leaders have viewed U.S=
=2E military power as indispensable to global stability. Known as =E2=80=9Cp=
rimacy=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cliberal hegemony=2C=E2=80=9D U.S. military all=
iances=2C they believed=2C would secure the peace between foreign powers=
=2C and armed interventions would be necessary to prevent terrorism and ci=
vil conflicts abroad.

This grand strategy perspective is now undergoing major revisions=2C with=
 many foreign policy and military experts now calling for restraint. The U=
nited States is now viewed as greatly benefiting from a robust state of na=
tional security thanks to its geographic=2C economic=2C and military advan=
tages. Further=2C decades of rigorous military interventions and long-term=
 military alliances have caused more problems than they solved=E2=80=94and=
 a grand strategy of restraint aligns with the fundamental values at the c=
ore of our nation=E2=80=99s founding.

At this conference=2C experts on international security will deeply examin=
e the major shifts now taking place in global perspectives=2C and will bot=
h confront and critically examine the arguments and assumptions of the =E2=
=80=9Cprimacy=E2=80=9D consensus. Panelists will also discuss what form a=
 more restrained U.S. foreign policy should take=2C and the prospects for=
 restraint given American politics today.
