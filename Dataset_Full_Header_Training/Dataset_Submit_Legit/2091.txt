User,

Last Wednesday night, I could feel the energy in the room and from thos=
e who were following us online=2E It was a packed theatre, and we got #=
LatinoTalks2016 trending on Twitter! On behalf of our founders, Eva Lon=
goria and Henry R=2E Mu=C3=B1oz III, a sincere thanks to everyone who a=
ttended and watched our Facebook livestream: <<link>>

Our speakers spoke passionately about our community=E2=80=99s influence=
 and Chef Jos=C3=A9 Andr=C3=A9s said it best -- =E2=80=9CWe all have po=
wer=2E We just need to believe [it]=2E If you can influence one person =
to go vote in this election, it is one more vote we will get for immigr=
ation reform and support for Latino issues=2E=E2=80=9D

Can you help us reach more Latinos by chipping in $5 today: <<link>>
ly/1satqhM

As the presidential race continues, the presumed GOP nominee=E2=80=99s =
platform remains loaded with anti-Latino and anti-immigrant rhetoric=2E=
 It is of utmost urgency that we all use our voices to push back=2E=C2=A0

Latino Victory=E2=80=99s National co-chair, Melissa Mark-Viverito, made=
 it very clear -- =E2=80=9CThis election cycle is critically important,=
 and we need to be involved, engaged to go to the voting booths; to reg=
ister people to vote and to really mobilize=2E=E2=80=9D

We are six months out from the general election and moving full speed a=
head supporting candidates, registering new Latino voters, engaging and=
 mobilizing the community=2E=C2=A0

I hope we can count on your help with a $5 contribution today: <<link>>
