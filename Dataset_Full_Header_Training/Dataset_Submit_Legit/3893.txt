Pennsylvania voters overwhelmingly oppose Sen. Pat Toomey's obstruction of =
Chief Judge Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination.
Today, the Constitutional Responsibility Project released its first televis=
ion ad. The 30-second spot<<<link>>> showcases Sen. Too=
mey's (R-PA) unprecedented refusal to consider any Supreme Court nominee an=
d calls on Sen. Toomey to put the Constitution before his politics. The ad =
will air in the Philadelphia media market over the Senate recess.

Additionally, the Constitutional Responsibility Project, in conjunction wit=
h the League of Conservation Voters, released a new survey of Pennsylvania =
voters conducted by Hart Research. The survey found that Pennsylvania voter=
s support giving Judge Garland a hearing and an up-or-down vote and strongl=
y disapprove of the positon Senate Republican leadership has taken on this =
matter.

"This poll shows that Pennsylvanians strongly believe that Senator Toomey a=
nd others must give the president's nominee both a fair hearing and a timel=
y vote, and LCV members couldn't agree more.  Nearly 150,000 of them have s=
igned a petition calling on the Senate to do its job, including nearly 5,00=
0 in Pennsylvania alone," said Tiernan Sittenfeld, Senior Vice President of=
 Government Affairs, League of Conservation Voters.

A full memo from Hart Research Associates outlining the survey's findings a=
nd polling method can be found HERE<<<link>>
s/2016/04/WN9-PA.pdf>.

Key findings from the Constitutional Responsibility Project and the League =
of Conservation Voters survey include:

  *   By a margin of 56 percent to 37 percent, Pennsylvania voters say the =
Senate should hold hearings and give Chief Judge Garland an up-or-down-vote=
.
     *   Independent voters agree with this position by an event larger mar=
gin - 60 percent to 36 percent.
  *   After voters hear the pros and cons on Senator Toomey's positon on th=
e Supreme Court vacancy, feelings toward him become notably less favorable.
     *   Independents move from a small net positive view of Toomey (24 per=
cent positive, 18 percent negative) to a large net negative opinion of him =
(24 percent positive, 50 percent negative).
  *   At the start of the survey, 43 percent of voters said they were incli=
ned to vote for Senator Toomey over his Democratic challenger. After being =
told about his stance on Judge Garland's nomination, 46 percent of voters s=
aid they are less likely to support Senator Toomey.
  *   16 percent of voters said they would be more open to voting for the D=
emocratic challenger as a result of Senator Toomey's opposition to hearings=
 and a vote for Judge Garland.

Wisconsin voters do not approve of Sen. Johnson's Supreme Court obstruction=
.
Roll Call<<<link>>
on/> reports on a new poll finding that Sen. Ron Johnson's (R-WI) continued=
 refusal to consider Chief Judge Garland's nomination runs counter to the v=
alues of Wisconsin voters.

"60 percent of likely Wisconsin voters want to see the president and Senate=
 take action to fill the vacancy now... Roughly half of voters felt that by=
 blocking Obama's nominee, senators were "trying to advance their party's a=
genda rather than doing what is right for the country."

After meeting with Chief Merrick Garland yesterday, Sen. Gary Peters lauds =
his "impeccable legal credentials.
The domain.com News<<<link>>
peters-urges-senate-vote-impeccable-garland/83654934/> reports:

Sen. Peters (D-MI): "He comes to this nomination with ... impeccable legal =
credentials. On top of that, he has the domain.com of already being confirmed =
for his current position with broad bipartisan support. So this is the type=
 of candidate that certainly deserves to have a hearing.""

Chief Judge Garland is exactly the type of jurist we want on the Court.
Former U.S. solicitor general Ted Olson writes in the Wall Street Journal<h=
ttp://domain.com/articles/a-supreme-court-challenge-for-democrats-14618850=
48>:

Ted Olson, former U.S. solicitor general: "Mr. Garland is extraordinarily w=
ell qualified...Throughout his career, he has impressed his colleagues and =
his legal adversaries with his leadership, sense of fairness, and respect f=
or the law. He has been a judge for 19 years and is now chief judge on the =
U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. domain.com, considered by many to be the se=
cond-most-important court in the country. Scalia and three current justices=
 also served on the D.C. domain.com. By temperament, character and qualificati=
ons, Judge Garland is precisely the kind of jurist we want on the Supreme C=
ourt.  For Republicans, there is much to recommend giving Mr. Garland a goo=
d look, a respectful hearing and a vote on the merits."

Chief Judge Garland will approach the legal issues that face the disability=
 community with thought and care.
Michael Waterston, an expert in disability and civil rights law, reviewed C=
hief Judge Garland's record and found him to be a thoughtful and fair juris=
t.

Michael Waterstone, disability and civil rights law expert: "How will Justi=
ce Garland rule on the important issues facing the disability community - t=
hings like whether websites need to be accessible to individuals who are bl=
ind, or how far employers need to go in providing accommodations to workers=
 with disabilities, or whether voters with disabilities are entitled to sec=
ret and independent ballots, like everyone else? I don't know...But I do fe=
el confident that Justice Garland would approach the questions carefully an=
d thoughtfully, and without a predefined agenda against the rights of domain.com=
e with disabilities."[Loyola Law School, 4/28/16<<<link>>
