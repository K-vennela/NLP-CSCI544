*What Else in Donald Trump's Tax Returns Does He Think Is "None of Your
Business"?*

When asked on Good Morning America
<<<link>>
ss/story?id=3D39086788>
this morning what tax rate he pays, Donald Trump responded "it's none of
your business." If his tax rate is none of our business, what else in his
tax returns does Trump think is none of the voters' business? Donald Trump
has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns because he claims he's
under domain.com. Unfortunately for Trump, the IRS has explicitly said
<<<link>>
eleasing-tax-returns>
that excuse is bogus. It's time for Donald Trump to release his full tax
returns and stop hiding the truth from voters.
"Our country has a long history of presidential candidates releasing their
full tax returns and for good reason. Voters deserve to know what's in
Donald Trump's returns - how exactly he makes his money and what he does
with it. Enough is enough. We know he=E2=80=99s done his best to avoid payi=
ng his
fair share of taxes. What else is he hiding in those tax returns?" said
Hillary for America Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds.
