Mark / User, can you please flag this for Brooklyn?

This is ready for research

SL: When Trump takes to it Twitter to talk about women

Today, the Wall Street Journal reported<<<link>>
ublicans-say-donald-trump-is-changing-the-political-playbook-1463339320?mod=
=3De2tw> that =93Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to deny he has mistrea=
ted women.=94

Oh really? Perhaps he=92s forgetting some of his most offensive tweets:

On Megyn Kelly=85.

[cid:image001.jpg@01D1AF96.F485F530]<<<link>>

[cid:image002.jpg@01D1AF96.F485F530]<<<link>>
atus/710947686879531008>

Or Arianna Huffington=85.

[cid:image003.jpg@01D1AF96.F485F530]<<<link>>
atus/240462265680289792>

Or that time he called her a dog=85.

atus/585281558816370690?ref_src=3Dtwsrc%5Etfw>

Or attacking a woman because of the way she looks=85..

[cid:image005.jpg@01D1AF96.F485F530]<<<link>>
atus/262584296081068033?ref_src=3Dtwsrc%5Etfw>

[cid:image006.jpg@01D1AF96.F485F530]<<<link>>
atus/261921511634518016>

Or that time he harassed Heidi Cruz<<<link>>
rump-targets-ted-cruzs-wife-twitter/story?id=3D37889421>, or called Megyn K=
elly a bimbo<<<link>>>=
=85.

So there=92s not much Trump can denying that Trump can do here. He has had =
a long, persistent record of hatred and mistreatment of insulting and denig=
rating women, and he has his own words in these tweets show he has neither =
the temperament or judgment to serve. to prove it.

Because of his disgusting and sexist attacks on women, Donald Trump is unfi=
t to be president.
