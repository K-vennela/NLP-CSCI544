Gaggle with Dean Heller

<<link>>

-          Dean Heller says he will not vote for HRC but isn't committing to Trump either

-          Says that there are other options besides HRC and Trump

-          Points out that you can vote for 'none of these candidates' in NV

-          If there's a third party candidate, everybody's going to take a look

-          Doesn't know if he'll go to the GOP convention, has to talk to his wife

-          "I have to sit down, talk to my wife, see if she's comfortable going to Cleveland."

-          Basically says that Trump has hurt Joe Heck's chances at getting elected

-          Joe Heck has a "great" relationship with the Hispanic, Latino community but those who don't know him, who are they going to vote for?
