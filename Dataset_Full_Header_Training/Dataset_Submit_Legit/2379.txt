See below. Is it helpful for us to start putting out state party chairs who can talk about how peaceful their conventions are and that Nevada was an anomaly, or is that counterproductive? Ohio volunteers.

Thanks

Hey TJ,

Just got off the phone with Greg Beswick, our ED out of Ohio. With everything going on in NV, he wanted it to be known that they held their convention last weekend, and that it went off without a hitch. He said that HFA and Bernie folks were respectful of each other, and that the entire thing was orderly and organized with some really productive conversations about how everyone can unite to drive the party forward.

He said that he also knows that they're not the only state party with this story, and that he's happy to get people on the record to talk about how Nevada was an anomaly. I'm not sure if you're looking to shift the narrative in this way, but this could be helpful if so.
