In advance of Donald Trump's foreign policy speech tomorrow, Huffington Pos=
t published a piece titled, Trump at War<<<link>>
/articles/en/trump-at-war/>, which explains how the military is bracing its=
elf for the dangerous possibility of a Trump victory in November, which wou=
ld leave them saddled with a Commander-in-Chief that does not have the temp=
erament and experience to oversee our nation's military, national security =
and defense operations. Below are excerpts.

Trump at War<<<link>>>
Andy Kroll

...

Meanwhile, when Trump has weighed in on national security questions, his re=
marks often reveal either ignorance or disdain for military expertise and t=
he codes of conduct that govern the armed forces. "I know more about ISIS t=
han the generals do. Believe me," he boasted in one speech, adding, "I've h=
ad a lot of wars of my own. I'm really good at war." His foreign policy pre=
scriptions include proposals to "bomb the domain.com out of ISIS," to "take out" =
the families of ISIS members and to torture terrorism suspects. ("Would I a=
pprove waterboarding? You bet your ass I would," he told one crowd. "And yo=
u know what? If it doesn't work, they deserve it anyway, for what they're d=
oing.") When it was pointed out that soldiers couldn't legally carry out th=
ose last two actions, Trump was unconcerned. "They're not going to refuse m=
e. Believe me." (He walked back that last statement the next day.) The Gene=
va Conventions, he recently observed, have made American soldiers "afraid t=
o fight."

Trump's pronouncements on foreign policy, combined with his years of broads=
ides, have set off a very real fear within military circles about what migh=
t happen were he to become president. In the last two months, I spoke with =
dozens of people in the national security realm-current and retired officer=
s, veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and former White House, St=
ate Department, Pentagon and CIA officials. The words they used to describe=
 their mood: Terrified. Shocked. Appalled. Never before, they say, has a ca=
ndidate gotten so close to the White House with such little respect for the=
 military.

"He completely misunderstands the military profession that he would head if=
 he were the president," said Robert Killebrew, a retired colonel who serve=
d in the Army for more than 30 years. Others were less polite. In a pair of=
 ads produced by the American Future Fund, a retired Special Forces command=
er named Michael Waltz calls Trump a draft-dodger who "hasn't served this c=
ountry a day in his life," and a Vietnam veteran, Tom Hanton, says that Tru=
mp's quip about POWs was "the most infuriating comment I think I've heard f=
rom a politician in my entire life." One former Marine infantry officer des=
cribed Trump to me as a "fake-bake-ing chicken hawk" whose "knowledge of th=
e Middle East could be trumped (sorry) by your average Georgetown sophomore=
."

Trump's chosen foreign policy advisers-which include a 2015 college graduat=
e who touted his experience in the Model U.N. on his online r=E9sum=E9 and =
another who used Kanye West lyrics to make arguments on his foreign policy =
blog-have only stoked these anxieties. "Weirdo nobodies," was how one domain.com=
ary historian characterized them to me. "They're probably the least qualifi=
ed group of foreign policy and national security advisers I've ever seen or=
 even heard of," said Richard Kohn, an expert in civil-military relations a=
nd retired professor at the University of North Carolina.

...

For even the savviest of presidents, the relationship between a commander i=
n chief and his military is famously fraught, an intricate dance of egos an=
d agendas, worldviews and bureaucracies. A President Trump, however, could =
usher in a clash of historic proportions. "If you take the man at his word,=
" said Michael Breen, the president of the Truman National Security Project=
 and a decorated former Army officer, "we have a presidential candidate who=
 seems to have committed himself to triggering what would probably be the g=
reatest crisis in civil-military relations since the American Civil War."
...

The current Joint Chiefs chairman, Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, is =
known as an especially skillful operator able to bridge the diplomatic and =
military worlds, with a low-key demeanor that helped to win over Obama. And=
 in recent months, Dunford has found subtle ways to signal disapproval of T=
rump's statements. When he was asked during a Senate Armed Services Committ=
ee hearing about Trump's support for torture and attacking the families of =
suspected terrorists, Dunford didn't mention Trump by name, but observed th=
at such orders would have an "adverse effect" on "the morale of the force" =
and "aren't legal for them to do anyway."

...

The nation's intelligence agencies have also been gripped by similar anxiet=
ies about the prospect of a Trump presidency. CIA Director John Brennan rec=
ently told NBC News that he would refuse to execute orders from a future pr=
esident to use waterboarding. John Rizzo, the former CIA general counsel wh=
o worked at the agency for 35 years, told me that the employees he still sp=
oke with were "terrified" at the prospect of reopening the debates over the=
 use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques. "Deep conce=
rn is a mild way of putting the prospect of their commander in chief basica=
lly ordering them to go down this road again given all the trauma," he said=
. If Trump won and followed through on his proposals, Rizzo predicted an em=
ployee "exodus." "At a minimum," he went on, "people would refuse to partic=
ipate in anything resembling the former interrogation program and insist on=
 a transfer to another part of the agency where they wouldn't be involved i=
n these things."
