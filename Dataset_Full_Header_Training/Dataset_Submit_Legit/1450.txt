So what to do? Speaking Trump=92s name gives him power. He is like Voldemor=
t in that regard. (Also, he is immortal and cannot die as long as his Tower=
s survive. His buildings are his horcruxes and contain fragments of his sou=
l.)

The trick is not to speak his name.

But fortunately for senators in tough, competitive seats, there is another =
option. You don=92t have to endorse Trump. You can just support the Nominee=
 of the Party.

Donald Trump is terrible. Good thing there=92s this =91nominee=92 guy!<http=

Donald Trump is a problem.

He has a 65 percent unfavorable rating<<<link>>
lls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html>. He is prone to firing off =
unexpectedly at the mouth. He either doesn=92t understand or actively wants=
 to destroy the domain.com of the United States. If you=92re a senator running =
for reelection and his name shows up at the top of the ticket, you might as=
 well tie an albatross around your neck and head out to sea.

So what to do? Speaking Trump=92s name gives him power. He is like Voldemor=
t in that regard. (Also, he is immortal and cannot die as long as his Tower=
s survive. His buildings are his horcruxes and contain fragments of his sou=
l.)

The trick is not to speak his name.

But fortunately for senators in tough, competitive seats, there is another =
option. You don=92t have to endorse Trump. You can just support the Nominee=
 of the Party.

These are not the same thing at all! They are quite different. The Nominee =
is everything Trump isn=92t.

Here=92s Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) talking about Trump<<<link>>
d.com/andrewkaczynski/three-senators-say-they-disagree-with-trump-but-will-=
support?utm_term=3D.wcYMeXkd7#.chDQ3JpVo>: =93I have strong disagreements w=
ith Mr. Trump.=94

Here=92s McCain talking about the Nominee: =93The nominee of the party, the=
 party of Ronald Reagan and Teddy Roosevelt, has my support.=94

Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) won=92t endorse Trump. In February, she said<htt=
p://domain.com/Ayotte-intends-to-support-GOP-nominee#sthash.NVn9OI=
iS.dpuf>, =93There=92s no place in our society for racism and bigotry, and =
I found Mr. Trump=92s response to David Duke and the KKK disgusting and off=
ensive.=94 But she will support the nominee. Her communications director, L=
iz Johnson, confirmed as much to the New Hampshire Union Leader<<<link>>
domain.com/primary-plus/nh-sen-ayotte-will-support---but-not-endorse--=
-trump--20160504#sthash.luv0Wq9e.dpuf>. =93As she=92s said from the beginni=
ng, Kelly plans to support the nominee.=94

It is good that there is this third option. The Nominee sounds wonderful.

He seems to have a strong base of support. Senators who have nothing positi=
ve to say about Trump at all speak glowingly of the mysterious Nominee<http=
://domain.com/interactive/2016/05/08/us/politics/trump-endorsements-co=
ngress-republicans-gop.html?_r=3D0>.

Very little is known about him, apart from the fact that he is probably sta=
tesmanlike and definitely not embarrassing to have at the top of the ticket=
, and probably Reagan would have liked to have a beer with him, or somethin=
g, but what more do you need to know?

Andrew Kaczynski at BuzzFeed<<<link>>
-senators-say-they-disagree-with-trump-but-will-support?utm_term=3D.wcYMeXk=
d7#.chDQ3JpVo> first noted the groundswell of support for this Nominee guy =
among high-ranking senators during a KTAR Arizona radio interview with McCa=
in, Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska). The Nominee, McCain co=
nfirmed, has his support. Trump, not so much. =93I=92m not comfortable with=
 a lot of the things that he has done,=94 McCain noted.

Sullivan concurred. =93There=92s a number of things I don=92t agree with in=
 terms of what Donald Trump has said on the campaign trail,=94 he said on t=
he same show. =93Some of his rhetoric, some of his policy, certainly some o=
f his instincts on national security and foreign policy.=94

But fortunately, Sullivan has another choice. =93I plan on supporting the R=
epublican nominee. At this time.=94

Cotton concurred. =93I=92ve long said that I will support the Republican no=
minee because we can=92t afford a third Obama-Clinton term.=94

The Nominee of the Party sounds like a rational guy. Even House Speaker Pau=
l Ryan (R-Wis.) =97 who is =93not ready<<<link>>
leii/paul-ryan-refuses-to-endorse-donald-trump-for-the-time-being?bftwnews&=
utm_term=3D.wlbr21Dmx#.wiROaDJxL>=94 to support Trump =97 had compliments f=
or the Nominee. =93We hope that our nominee aspires to be Lincoln or Reagan=
-esque,=94 Ryan observed<<<link>>
refuses-to-endorse-donald-trump-for-the-time-being?bftwnews&utm_term=3D.wlb=
r21Dmx#.wiROaDJxL>.

Lincoln or Reagan-esque? Wow! What a high bar.

This =93nominee=94 character sounds almost as good as that Never Trump fell=
ow. (Whatever happened to him, by the way?)

=93Senator McCain, we already know that you=92re supporting Trump, but are =
you endorsing Trump?=94 the KTAR hosts asked.

=93I=92m supporting the nominee of the party,=94 McCain responded<<<link>>
domain.com/andrewkaczynski/three-senators-say-they-disagree-with-trump=
-but-will-support?utm_term=3D.wcYMeXkd7#.chDQ3JpVo>. =93I=92m telling you t=
he answer and that is, I=92m supporting our nominee.=94

Given the choice of Donald Trump and the Nominee of the Republican Party, t=
hese senators would support the Nominee of the Party, hands down.

If they turn out to be the same person, this is going to be very uncomforta=
ble.
