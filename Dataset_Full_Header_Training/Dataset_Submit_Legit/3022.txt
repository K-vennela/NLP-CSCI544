Statement of California Democratic Party Executive Director Chris Masami My=
ers on Democrats=92 Latest Gains in Voter Registration

The latest California voter registration report<<<link>>
istration/news-releases-and-advisories/2016-news-releases-and-advisories/se=
cretary-state-padilla-releases-report-voter-registration-june-7-primary-ele=
ction/> shows an unmistakable trend: Democrats continue to rise while Repub=
licans lose more ground. Democratic voters now hold a 16-point edge over Re=
publicans, up from 13 points in 2012.

While California Democrats have led the charge to rebuild our economy, crea=
te 2 million jobs since 2011, balance the state budget, and restore our cre=
dit rating from worst in the nation to its highest level since 2001, Republ=
ican leader Donald Trump and his party=92s dangerous ideas are driving Cali=
fornia Republicans toward third-party status.
