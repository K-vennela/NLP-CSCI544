Looks like we might be able to get this done today! I'm going to go ahead with it now.

I just bumped her again. This is out of character - if she doesn't respond today, I'll call.

It's a gamble - I'm probably 95% certain that it's going to happen, so what to do with that information is entirely your choice.

Apparently they send all business cards as a group and this is the only day for a month. Should I just switch it assuming it should come through? I can just not use the cards till it's final.

I just emailed our Twitter contact to bump her on that - I'm hoping soon, but it's hard to say. Can you hold off on ordering until Monday so I can get a firm answer?

Hey Cate, quick question. What's the timing on the new Twitter handle? I'm getting new business cards but figured might be worth changing the handle on the cards

Hi there,

Please approve the attached business card by 4pm today. If you'd like to change anything, we can update now as well.

Thanks!
