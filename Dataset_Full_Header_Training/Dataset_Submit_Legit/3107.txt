Hi April, one of our regional press desks - Walter Garcia - is going to be in Philly on Friday. He's already going to say hi to a couple of others there at the convention and I wanted to make sure you guys met. We don't yet know how we'll use our team once we get to convention, but good to know we can drop in extra staff if we need to for that final crush. I'm copying him here so you guys can connect.

:)
