Subject: Trump=92s message to black America: Ferguson and Oakland are the n=
ew Iraq

Donald Trump has put down the dog whistle in favor of a megaphone. In an in=
terview with The New York Times Magazine, Donald Trump equated Ferguson and=
 Oakland to Iraq, claiming both cities are =93among the most dangerous in t=
he world.=94 Equating these two American cities to a war zone is meant to s=
toke fear of living in black communities, and further highlights his callou=
s disregard for the African-American community.

Trump hasn=92t shied away from using race as a wedge issue during his presi=
dential bid. He immediately launched into a verbal tirade against Mexican i=
mmigrants, calling them criminals, drug dealers and rapists when he launche=
d his campaign.

He was slow to distance himself David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the =
Ku Klux Klan who endorsed the campaign, during a Meet the Press interview. =
Trump also vowed to ban Muslims from entering the United States within his =
first 100 days in office, and claimed that thousands of Muslims were cheeri=
ng as the World Trade Center fell during September 11.

Trump=92s latest message to black America that Ferguson and Oakland are the=
 new Iraq is yet another example of his dangerous and divisive race-baiting=
. We=92re not sure how much lower Trump can sink, but the bottom of his cam=
paign shows no depth.
