Trump testing out some new lines of attack against HRC
And continuing to go hard on the Clintons' marriage

Trump Campaign Rally in Lynden WA at 6pm ET:

Broke all time vote record
- Don't want to be complacent just because we already won

Crooked Hillary running ads against me

Supposedly most talented GOP field
- Knocked them off one-by-one
- Perry, Rand Paul endorsed me

Complains about an idiot that was on the Kelly File last night
- Abraham Lincoln couldn't have broken 50% with so many people in the field

Ben Carson got me in some trouble yesterday for saying I might name a Democrat as VP
- He didn't mean that, he got misquoted

The only one I like better than Mike Huckabee is his daughter

Hitting Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham as dishonorable
- China was begging for a low energy president
- I will gain votes from Jeb Bush not coming to the convention
- They say I'm not a true conservative. Who cares? We have to straighten out our country

Build the wall
- Have to keep the drugs out. The heroin is killing our children
- A Mars bar costs more than the heroin, it's so plentiful

The last person Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to run against is Trump
- She will be worse than Obama
- Goofy Elizabeth Warren. Done nothing in the Senate.
- You're not allowed to say Indian, so I'll say Native American
- She said she thought she was Native American because her mom had high cheekbones
- Whole career is a fraud
- HRC is too smart to pick Elizabeth Warren

Brags about Tom Brady... in Washington

Washington economic stats

Hits HRC as being "trigger happy" on foreign policy
- She has a bad temperament. Her husband found that out a few times

Iran Deal
- Kerry is an idiot
- Hate to generalize, but over history, Persians are great negotiators
- He got injured in a bicycle race at 73 years old. I promise to never be in a bicycle race

Bad decisions in Iraq
- Now Iraq is Harvard for terrorists
- Iraq didn't knock down the WTC
- "The Iraqis did not knock over the World Trade Center, if you had any questions"
- "Libyan oil is the best oil. My oil experts tell me this"

HRC was sleeping at 3am for the phone call
HRC wants to abolish the 2nd amendment
- Wants to take your guns and bullets away

HRC might appoint 5 new justices
- You would have a Supreme Court that would destroy our country

HRC buying $90 million in ads against me
- Her husband was biggest abuser of women in history of politics
- TRUMP: "I'm like a baby. A baby."
- Trump mocks Bill Clinton "I did not have sex with that woman" line

Sympathizing with Bernie Sanders
- No fan of the guy, but system is rigged

Don't domain.com until the 24th to vote

We can win Washington state in November. And Oregon

"Be careful of Trump"

Go home and vote
