Thanks, I had thought that was the case, so no need for a topper

I can blast it without a topper, then.

Kind of speaks for itself, though.

I think we should blast this with the topper that Democrats are the only on=
es who stand with women. There is a Clinton mention at the bottom unfortuna=

Their only choice within the GOP is a man who called women =93fat pigs=94 a=
nd made sexual jokes about his daughter.

Tuesday night was a rough one for Republican women. When Sen. Ted Cruz (R-T=
exas) dropped out of the primary, Donald Trump =97 a man who has referred t=
o women as =93dog,=94 =93slobs,=94 =93fat pigs,=94 and =93disgusting animal=
s=94 =97 became their likely only GOP choice in November.

Trump has done about everything he can to alienate and offend women voters.=
 On his reality TV show, =93Celebrity Apprentice=94, he told a female conte=
stant, =93Must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees.=94 And when=
 Fox News reporter Megyn Kelly asked him about those derogatory remarks, he=
 said that she must have =93blood coming out of her wherever.=94

In April, Trump said women should be punished for having abortions =97 a po=
sition that shocked even the anti-abortion movement. The businessman has jo=
ked about being sexually attracted to his daughter, and he said his likely =
Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has nothing=
 going for her except =93the women=92s card.=94 Trump=92s campaign manager =
assaulted a conservative female reporter at a campaign rally, leaving a bru=
ise on her arm, and then accused her of making up the story.

Most recently, Trump likened the trade deal between China and the United St=
ates to rape. =93We can=92t continue to allow China to rape our country,=94=
 he said at a rally in Indiana this week, =93and that=92s what they=92re do=
ing.=94

Women strongly dislike Trump. Seven in 10 American women =97 and 46 percent=
 of Republican women =97  have an unfavorable view of him, according to a r=
ecent Gallup poll. But now the latter group has to come to terms with the f=
act that they will probably not have another option within their party.

Anti-abortion groups and conservative women=92s groups, who have actively c=
ampaigned against Trump throughout the Republican primary, are in an especi=
ally awkward position. Penny Nance, the president of the conservative Chris=
tian group Concerned Women for America, told The Huffington Post that the c=
hoice between Trump and Clinton would be a nightmare for Republican women.

=93I don=92t know that we would endorse anyone,=94 Nance said in an intervi=
ew with HuffPost. =93That would be a horrible choice for our members.=94

Republican women candidates are also in a bind. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) =
reluctantly acknowledged Wednesday morning, without even mentioning Trump=
=92s name, that she still =93plans to support the nominee.=94 Her challenge=
r, New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan (D) has used that statement against Ayo=
tte in campaign materials.

=93While Kelly Ayotte just today made her support for Donald Trump official=
, they=92ve long been in agreement when it comes to critical issues such as=
 their desire to defund Planned Parenthood, undermine Roe v. Wade, and obst=
ruct the Supreme Court confirmation process,=94 Hassan=92s campaign said in=
 a statement. =93The people of New Hampshire will soundly reject the Trump-=
Ayotte ticket in November.=94

Trump said he thinks women voters will still vote for him because he can pr=
otect them from terrorism =97 but with only half of women in his own party =
supporting him, the numbers don=92t add up to a win for him. Clinton will c=
lobber Trump among single and minority women, who usually lean left anyway.=
 But even white women, who voted for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney =
over President Obama by a margin of 56 to 42 percent in 2012, overwhelmingl=
y disapprove of Trump, according to a recent Washington Post poll.

Meanwhile, Clinton is laughing all the way to the bank. Trump=92s =93woman =
card=94 comment drove $2.4 million in fundraising for the likely Democratic=
 nominee=92s campaign, and she wasted no time using Trump=92s women problem=
s to her advantage.

=93If fighting for women=92s health care and paid family leave and equal pa=
y is playing the woman card,=94 she said, smiling, to a crowd in Pennsylvan=
ia last week, =93then deal me in!=94

Editor=92s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a=
 serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has rep=
eatedly pledged to ban all Muslims =97 1.6 billion members of an entire rel=
igion =97 from entering the U.S.
