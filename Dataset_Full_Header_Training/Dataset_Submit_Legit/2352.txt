Gowdy Finally Concedes Military Could Not Have Saved Lives in Benghazi

Admission Comes After Statements from Republican Chief Counsel Released to =
Public

WASHINGTON=97After years of repeated Republican conspiracy theories that Se=
cretary Hillary Clinton or others ordered the U.S. military to stand down i=
n Benghazi or otherwise prevented a military response that could have saved=
 American lives, Rep. Trey Gowdy, the Chairman of the House Select Committe=
e on Benghazi, finally conceded in an interview on FOX News that the milita=
ry could not have gotten to Benghazi in time to save the lives of the four =
Americans killed that night<<<link>>>:

=93Whether or not they could have gotten there in time, I don=92t think the=
re is any issue with respect to that=97they couldn=92t.=94

His admission comes after Democrats released statements<<<link>>
domain.com/news/press-releases/chairman-gowdy-s-republican-chief-coun=
sel-on-military-response-nothing-could> from his Chief Counsel earlier this=
 week from closed-door interviews conducted by the Select Committee with De=
fense Secretary Panetta and his Chief of Staff, Jeremy Bash.

In response, Benghazi Select Committee Ranking Member Elijah E. Cummings, H=
ouse Armed Services Ranking Member Adam Smith, and House Intelligence Ranki=
ng Member Adam Schiff issued the following statements:

=93Chairman Gowdy has finally admitted what we have all known for years:  t=
he central Republican allegation that the military was told to withhold ass=
ets that could have saved lives in Benghazi for political reasons is wrong,=
=94 said Ranking Member Cummings.  =93Based on the Chairman=92s admission t=
oday, I call on the Select Committee to stop harassing the Pentagon with ba=
seless demands, release the transcripts of our witness interviews, and stop=
 wasting millions of taxpayer dollars dragging out the investigation closer=
 and closer to the election.=94

=93Now even Chairman Gowdy is agreeing with his Chief Counsel=92s statement=
s, which badly undermine the political case the Benghazi Committee has been=
 trying to make against Secretary Clinton,=94 said Ranking Member Smith. =
=93When are we going to stop interfering with the Defense Department=92s op=
erations and spending taxpayer money for this charade?=94

=93For months, Republicans on the Benghazi Select Committee have suggested =
that shocking, new details will upend our knowledge of the tragic attack in=
 Benghazi =96 from gun running, to stand-down orders, to top level interfer=
ence with the rescue attempt,=94 said Ranking Member Schiff. =93Now, Chairm=
an Gowdy himself has been forced to domain.com that one of the most pernicious o=
f those theories =96 that additional military assistance could have gotten =
there in time to prevent the deaths of those four Americans =96 has no basi=
s in fact.  The Majority, which will not share its draft report with the Mi=
nority, must see that its work has already been discredited by its partisan=
, inconsistent and often incoherent work-product. It should finally bring t=
he committee's work to a close, and end the political charade once and for =
all.=94

Background:

Gowdy=92s admission is consistent with the conclusions<<<link>>
domain.com/news/press-releases/chairman-gowdy-s-republican-chief-couns=
el-on-military-response-nothing-could> of his own former Chief Counsel, a r=
etired three-star general, as well as those of the House Armed Services Com=
mittee Chairman Republican Buck McKeon, who stated<<<link>>
s/2014/04/10/gop-chairman-satisfied-with-military-response-to-benghazi-atta=
ck.html> more than two years ago:

=93I think I=92ve pretty well been satisfied that given where the troops we=
re, how quickly the thing all happened and how quickly it dissipated, we pr=
obably couldn=92t have done more than we did.=94

The conclusion also corroborates the views of Admiral Michael Mullen, Vice =
Chairman of the independent Accountability Review Board and former Chairman=
 of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, when he stated<<<link>>
domain.com/assets/answers/18.pdf#page=3D59>:

=93There=92s no one I=92ve ever met in the military that wouldn=92t want to=
 get help there instantly. The physics of it, the reality of it, it just wa=
sn=92t going to happen for 12 to 20 hours. And I validated that in my revie=
w when I went to the Pentagon to look at every single asset that was postur=
ed in theater, including those jets in Aviano.=94

Today=92s admission by the Chairman<<<link>>
ZSyIj0> rebuts years of allegations by Republicans and others that the mili=
tary could have gotten to Benghazi in time to save lives, but that they wer=
e improperly prevented by Secretary Clinton or others for political reasons=
.

On February 17, 2014, Rep. Darrell Issa stated<<<link>>
re/concord-nh/issa-i-will-get-to-the-top-of-benghazi> during a political ca=
mpaign event:

=93We need to have an answer of when the secretary of defense had assets th=
at he could have begun spinning up.  Why there was not one order given to t=
urn on one Department of Defense asset?  I have my suspicions, which is Sec=
retary Clinton told Leon [Panetta] to stand down, and we all heard about th=
e stand-=ADdown order for two military personnel.  That order is undeniable=
.  They were told not to get on =97 get off the airplane and kind of stand =
by =97 and they=92re going to characterize it wasn=92t stand-down.  But whe=
n we=92re done with Benghazi, the real question is, was there a stand=AD-do=
wn order to Leon Panetta or did he just not do his job?  Was there a stand-=
down order from the president who said he told them to use their resources =
and they didn=92t use them?  Those questions have to be answered.=94

On September 5, 2014, Rep. Louie Gohmert stated<<<link>>
ch?v=3DxFF5A2-rrEY>:

=93And they let those people die at Benghazi.  They could=92ve gotten plane=
s there sooner.  They could have gotten people there sooner.=94

On May 8, 2013, Rep. Adam Kinzinger stated<<<link>>
=3DjgmVAgx1cVU>:

=93If you look at Italy, one thousand =96 I think =96 forty-six miles away =
is Aviano Air Base from Benghazi.  All you had to do was send F-16s from Av=
iano to Benghazi and they can do something called a show of force, it=92s b=
asically a low fly over, and it=92s done all the time in Iraq and Afghanist=
an to stop attacks from happening. We could have done that and for some rea=
son we didn=92t.=94

On May 10, 2013, Senator Marco Rubio stated<<<link>>
da-senator-marco-rubio-on-the-benghazi-hearings-and-the-first-day-of-markup=
-of-teh-immigratino-bill/>:

=93In essence, there are now witnesses saying that they were ready to go in=
 and help at least prevent the second wave of attacks, but they were told t=
o stand down.  So either they didn=92t have the people available, which is =
a dereliction of duty, or, and an irresponsible thing to do, or they did ha=
ve the people, but they decided not to send them.=94

Democrats renew their call to release all the witness interview transcripts=
 and disband this wasteful committee that has already cost taxpayers nearly=
 $7 million dollars and counting.
