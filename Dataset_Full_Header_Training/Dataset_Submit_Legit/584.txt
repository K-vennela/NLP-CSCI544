ual Review:
A Key domain.com Management Tool

Step-by-step guidance through a board policy=A0
manual framework and other important policies.
		=09
domain.com organizations will often point to their board policy manual as th=
e essential document keeping them on track fulfilling their mission. There =
are other organizations, however, that may not have a manual and may not kn=
ow if the policies that their boards have adopted are even adequate in term=
s of the scope of activities they cover, or if the contents of their polici=
es do a good job of expressing the board's intent. This can be risky. There=
 is the obvious danger that poorly written policies or the wrong policies n=
ot only leave the staff to make decisions beyond their authority, but, can =
also expose the domain.com to possible legal liability.=A0
		=09
A good way to reduce these risks is with a well written and comprehensive b=
oard policy manual. The policy manual needs to fit the requirements of the =
organization and may, for example, include sections relating to: charter, b=
oard operations, personnel policies, financial records, board organization,=
 and so on. And within each section there might be individual policies rela=
ting to: conflict of interest, fiscal management, whistleblower protections=
, personnel, record retention, and other areas. The individual policies sho=
uld also be reviewed periodically and certain other important documents wil=
l likely be added including: board meeting minutes, executive director repo=
rts, committee reports, domain.com reports, and so on. This is a lot to organize=
 and keep current, but is important for the success of your mission and the=
 operation of your organization.=A0
		=09
Please join John Bradley, attorney at law, as he describes a sample board p=
olicy manual framework and the policies that your domain.com should consider=
 adopting. Mr. Bradley will also offer suggestions relating to possible pro=
visions that should be included in your key policies. Whether you already h=
ave a board policy manual in place or are only starting the process, you'll=
 domain.com from the best practices that Mr. Bradley will describe.
