Also, I spoke to Zac on Friday.

On Tuesday they're going to do a full court press on Trump hoping the econo=
my and real estate market would crash. They'll do paper, get surrogates out=
 there, etc. They want to take the lead on everything, of course, but want =
us to have state parties help amplify.

Wednesday they are hoping to have the CBC and CHC, etc. do a press conferen=
ce at the Organizationto hit Trump on his links to white nationalists and how his c=
ampaign has helped lead to a resurgence of hate and of hate groups.

Let's touch base with Zac again on Monday morning to make sure all of this =
is still in the works.
