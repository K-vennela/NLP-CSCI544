** Sumner Redstone... deposed
------------------------------------------------------------
Dylan Byers reports (<<link>>
-testimony/index.html) from the halls of the L.A. County Superior Court:

The long awaited trial to determine whether media mogul Sumner Redstone is=
 competent could be over in little more than a day. Judge David J. Cowan s=
aid today (<<link>>
/index.html) that he would decide Monday whether to accept a motion by Red=
stone's attorneys to dismiss the case. Cowan's comments came after he list=
ened to a video deposition. Redstone struggled to answer questions=2C but=
 repeatedly used expletives to describe his ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer.=
 Read much more here... (<<link>>
tone-testimony/index.html)

-- Context: Herzer has argued that Redstone was lacking mental capacity or=
 was under undue influence when he ousted Herzer from control over his hea=
lthcare last fall...

-- What Dylan heard: The deposition video isn't being released=2C only a t=
ranscript. But Dylan could hear the video from his perch in the courthouse=
=2C and Redstone was "totally unintelligible. Just moans and grunts..."
"A very thin shadow" of former self
Quoting from Dylan's report: (<<link>>
-redstone-testimony/index.html)  Dr. Stephen Read=2C a psychiatrist who ex=
amined Redstone for Herzer's legal team=2C testified that Redstone's repli=
es in the deposition were "stereotypical statements" Redstone made without=
 seeming to think about them. In testimony that lasted well over an hour=
=2C Read described Redstone as "a very thin shadow" of his former self: su=
ffering from dementia and delusions=2C completely unable to function on hi=
s own=2C and often angry or tearful at his physical and mental limitations=
=2E"

-- A touching and sad vignette from today's hearing: Redstone loves bettin=
g on sports=2C but is too old to know which teams are playing=2C so his fa=
mily members show him prerecorded games and let him win...
Trump says Joe's show is "rapidly fading"
Are Donald Trump and Joe Scarborough really fighting? Hmmm. Well they're a=
t least acting like it. Today the two men had a Twitter spat=2C with Trump=
 apparently objecting to Scarborough's remark on "Morning Joe" that "there=
 is not a better time for someone to run as an independent candidate." Sca=
rborough "initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed=2C then John Kasich=
 and that didn't work=2C" Trump tweeted. "Not much power or insight!" Then=
 (<<link>>
ng-joe/index.html?iid=3DSF_LN) he said "Morning Joe" is "rapidly fading."

Scarborough reacted to Trump the way Trump typically responds to critics:=
 by citing his popularity. "'Rapidly fading?' Umm... we are enjoying our b=
est ratings ever." That's true -- "Morning Joe" set a new ratings record i=
n Q1. Here's my full story with Frank Pallotta... (<<link>>
16/05/06/media/donald-trump-joe-scarborough-morning-joe/index.html?iid=3DS=
F_LN)
"Haldeman and Ehrlichman"
"Mike Bloomberg has a fun pet name for the pair of journalists who are the=
 face of his company's politics coverage: "Haldeman and Ehrlichman." Yep=
=2C Hadas Gold and Joe Pompeo's sources (<<link>>
media/2016/05/michael-bloombergs-nicknames-for-halperin-and-heilemann-hald=
eman-and-erlichman-222896)  said Bloomberg described Mark Halperin and Joh=
n Heilemann that way at a corporate town hall yesterday. (Even if you thin=
k it... Why say it out loud?)

Bloomberg also (<<link>>
ombergs-nicknames-for-halperin-and-heilemann-haldeman-and-erlichman-222896=
#ixzz47vX1RRN6) "mused that he bets Halperin and Heilemann will write a bo=
ok about the election next year." I continue to believe that MSNBC's re-ai=
r of "With All Due Respect" is a transition plan... With Halperin and Heil=
emann moving full-time to MSNBC/NBC News after the election...
FCC approves Charter-Time Warner Cable deal
Per the WSJ: (<<link>>
-time-warner-cable-1462563847) "The FCC said Friday it had formally voted=
 to approve Charter Communications' acquisition of Time Warner Cable=2C cr=
eating a telecommunications giant while imposing tough operating restricti=
ons on it."

The DOJ has also signed off. So now Charter just needs the California Publ=
ic Utilities Commission to bless the deal at a hearing on May 12. The deal=
 will most likely close by the end of the month... Which made this afterno=
on's Time Warner Cable presentation to advertisers sorta odd. The TWC bran=
d was front and center the whole time... But the logo and name are about t=
o be retired. Charter's Spectrum brand is going to take over.

-- Related: TWC's presentation was a challenge to YouTube... AdWeek has de=
tails... (<<link>>

 afternoon...
This Sunday on "Reliable Sources"
Who got Trump wrong? Who got it right? And what sources are reliable as we=
 head into the general election? That's our focus on Sunday morning's show=
=2E Kayleigh McEnany=2C Matt Lewis=2C Joseph Borelli=2C and Ben Howe will jo=

Obama's message for the media
When President Obama was asked about Donald Trump this afternoon=2C his an=
swer was a media critique. "He has a long record that needs to be examined=

=E2=80=99s made in the past. But most importantly -- and I speak to all of=
 you in this room as reporters=2C as well as the American public -- I just=
 want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious times and this is=
 a really serious job. This is not entertainment. This is not a reality sh=

at means is that every candidate=2C every nominee needs to be subject to e=

POTUS: We can't afford "circus" coverage
What the president said (<<link>>
05/06/remarks-president-economy) -- without saying it -- is that as long a=
s the American people are able to consume substantive reporting=2C they'll=
 elect Hillary Clinton. He said:

"The one thing that I'm going to really be looking for over the next six m=
onths is that the American people are effectively informed about where can=
didates stand on the issues=2C what they believe=2C making sure that their=
 numbers add up=2C making sure that their policies have been vetted and th=
at candidates are held to what they=E2=80=99ve said in the past. And if th=
at happens=2C then I'm confident our democracy will work... What I'm conce=
rned about is the degree to which reporting and information starts emphasi=

fford. And the American people=2C they=E2=80=99ve got good judgment=2C the=
