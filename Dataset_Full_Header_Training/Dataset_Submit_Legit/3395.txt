On Friday, April 29, the architect of the modern rise of Britain's Conser=
vative Party, former senior political adviser to Prime Minister David Cam=
eron, and author of More Human: Designing a World Where People Come First=
, Steve Hilton joins Arthur Herman for a discussion of the 2015 election =
and the moral imperative of decentralizing government and business descri=
bed in his book.

Dissatisfied voters, prominent in this election cycle, feel angry and let=
 down by both their leaders and the institutions that dominate their live=
s from corporations to political parties and government. Yet the cause of=
 this malaise, according to political-advisor-turned-tech-CEO Steve Hilto=
n, is not being addressed by politicians on the left or the right.

Hilton argues that much of our daily experience=E2=80=94our food producti=
on system, government, economy, healthcare system, and more=E2=80=94has b=
ecome too big, too bureaucratic, and too distant from the human scale. Mo=
re Human sets an agenda for rethinking and redesigning the outdated syste=
ms and structures of our politics, government, economy, and society to ma=
ke them more suited to the way we want to live our lives today.
