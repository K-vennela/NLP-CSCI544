country. he's got to make this country great again. he's been saying the
right things. he's been saying a lot of things that people want to say but
they can't say. and he makes a lot of sense. so i support him.

illegal aliens coming in that are illegal. i came here legally from
the united states from italy. i'm legal right now. i'm an american

do. i personally wouldn't want to open it for everyone to come in. there's
nothing there at all. everyone's just walking in. he's talking about
illegal aliens. he's not talking about all of the latinos. he's talking
about people who are coming here and committing a lot of crimes.

*FRANCES RIVERA:* you were in a position. you immigrated too. you may have
famtily outside. some of these families fleeing violence. out of fear, they
want to come here. you're also talking about families who may have to
be broken up who have to be sent back. for somebody who's been here and can
understand the better life this country offers, is there any part of you
that has sympathy for that and their families?

*ANTONIO SABATO JR:* of course there is sympathy. but if you've done
something illegally, you have to go back. we have laws in this country
and we have the best laws this country could possibly have, in the world
actually. there's a lot of people in line waiting so many years trying
to come here legally, what do you do about them?

state. donald trump has major business interests there. when you talk to
people, is there that some of your fans find out you're a trump supporter
and kind of turn on you because of that at all? what are you hearing from
them?

stuff in the last seven years and we need the opposite. donald trump is the
opposite of that. the people want donald trump to be the next president of
the united states. you go to the rallies of hillary and bernie and you see
two people -- no, no, no. bernie sanders, there are thousands and
thousands, people wrapping around blocks. i've seen 30,000 people. hillary
clinton cannot even get half of 30,000 people. that's a lot.
