  Fall Food Truck

  Hi Dance Families,

I just wanted to remind you that The Oaks Performing Arts Society (OPAS) is hosting the Second Annual Fall Food Truck & Music Festival on Sunday, October 12, from 12:30 to 4:30pm on the OCS campus.  We want to build a broader sense of community by encouraging all students and their families to attend. This amazing event will showcase student performers, while you enjoy delicious, savory cuisine from our favorite gourmet food trucks. You and the family can also enjoy exciting, interactive booths such as the Dunk Tank and there will be special entertainment for the littlest of kids! Hope to see you there! (You may see me sitting that Dunk Tank)

-Miss Klipp
