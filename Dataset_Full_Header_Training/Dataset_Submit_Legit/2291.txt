Repeated entitlements comment from his MSNBC interview a bit earlier

Q: What exactly do you do for Trump?

Don't want to be piegeon-holed into any one thing

Need to deal with problems - big problem now is unity

Very gratified with the meeting with the Speaker and Trump

Trump is not a politician so he doesn't know political speak.

Q: NYT said your job is to get former rivals on board? Instrumental in setting up Ryan meeting?

Meeting would occur anyway

Trump is said to be against entitlement reform. He isn't against it, but he said it would be cruel and unusual to attack entitlements first. Wants to handle economy first, then do entitlement reform if it is still necessary

Q: Doesn't want any changes to SS and Medicare right?

Most important issue is economy. Need to decrease deficits instead of increase

Q: Graham tweet on Trump. Did you set that up?

I had nothing to do with that call

November will be an election that will determine what kind of country we are going to be

Q: Trump said you will help him pick a veep

My role is to talk about what kind of person we are looking for

I have a shifting role with him

Q: other candidates that ran really liked you. Is one of your assignments to get the other candidates to support Trump? Is that possible?

All things are possible. I would love to see a situation where all 17 of us could sit in a room for a discussion - with no media involved

This isn't about any one person, this is about America

Q: Could  you get Cruz or Jeb to endorse Trump?

I think if they think about the future of the country, they will come to the right conclusion

I would've hoped we learned from this process in 2012.

Great societies never have learned from others' mistakes, causing their downfall

Q: Open to being his VP?

I have no desire whatsoever to be anything in government

It would have to be an extraordinary circumstance and I don't see that occurring

I'm about to interview @RealBenCarson right at the top of the hour. He's deeply involved in helping @realDonaldTrump right now. #Wolf @CNN
