Hi video team, User was like these three clips spliced together in one video for as soon as possible. This is for a press release. Can we do that?

here<<<link>>>

1:15 - 2:13
"one of things you learn, first reports prove to be inaccurate...pressure to react before you really know what's going on..that's a quality politicians don't have at least until they have responsibility.
Mika: Possibly damaging
It prejudges the outcome.

8:37 - 8:42
And on the Republican side, pretty much what you hear is uninformed bluster and threats.

11:37 - 12:58
Mika - and the view of candidates from around the world...How does this impact national security
Gates: It already has an impact...they think we've lost our collective lives...concerned about what happens..especially apprehensive about the unpredictability and the threats of Mr. Trump, Japan/SK nukes, breaking off China...all of serious concern, even before the election, countries begin to take steps to offset these dangers or perceived shifts in U.S. policy in ways that put space betweent..
