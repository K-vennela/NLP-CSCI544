Learn the Facts: Dangerous Donald's Economic Policies

It's common knowledge know that Donald Trump would be dangerous for our country's national security at home and abroad - but his economic policies are just as dangerous. What he has proposed and said about the economy are harmful, ill-informed and would disrupt the historic trend of 73 consecutive months of private sector job growth under President Obama.

*         Donald Trump has proposed he would a trade war<<<link>>> with China, which experts say<<<link>>> would hurt American jobs and cause a global recession.

*         His trade agenda could cost<<<link>>> the United States $250 billion, would surmount to a global<<<link>>> trade war, and drive up<<<link>>> the prices of consumer goods.

*         Almost every fact check about Donald Trump's statements on trade have been rated as false (see here<<<link>>>, here<<<link>>> and here<<<link>>>), and as one expert put it<<<link>>>, "A vote for Trump is a vote against the American consumer."

*         Not only that, Trump also misunderstands basic facts about the economy. He repeatedly<<<link>>> likes to claimed that the unemployment rate is stands at 42%, and when Donald Trump said that there were 93 million people out of work, Politifact wrote<<<link>>> that Trump has a "basic misunderstanding of the labor market."

But, it's not just his dangerous rhetoric on the economy that are of concern. It goes beyond what Donald Trump says though - his Trump's business record also proves that Trump has demonstrated highlight's his poor business judgement and makes business deals that are in the best interest of himself, not the American worker. His companies have had to file for bankruptcy four times<<<link>>>, going so far as to proclaim themselves as "serial filers<<<link>>>." [they called themselves "serial filers" in court documents?] This type of financial mismanagement has led to about a thousand of Americans to lose their jobs, and Trump still likes to brag about how filing for bankruptcy was "an amazing, amazing deal!" [citation?] [We may want to lose this paragraph and focus on the bullets above about how he is dangerous.]

He said that the 2015 real estate collapse would be "very minor" and encouraged investors to purchase subprime mortgages. And while he even started his own business to sell subprime mortgages to borrowers with poor domain.com histories, he still blamed "regular consumers" for the financial crises.

"After a historic trend of 73 straight months of private sector job growth, Donald Trump's dangerous economic policies would be a disaster for erase the progress we have made under President Obama. America cannot afford a Trump presidency that hurts our standing around the world and puts all Americans at risk financially." - OrganizationNational Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach  His business record and economic record are harmful, ill-informed and would take us back to the American economy under George W. Bush, which helped the rich and left the middle class out to dry. Donald Trump is dangerous, and is domain.com to be commander in chief." - spox
