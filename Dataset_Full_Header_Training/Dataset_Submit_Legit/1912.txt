Subject: My Dad wants to do a podcast... Hi Steve, Hope this email finds you well.  My dad and his SF Giants broadcast partner are interested in doing a podcast ala Michael Davies "Men in Blazers" soccer podcast.  He would love to talk with Michael by phone to get his advice about how one starts such an endeavor.  How would you recommend getting them in touch with one another?   As always, thank you for being awesome Steve! Warmly,Emilie Miller
