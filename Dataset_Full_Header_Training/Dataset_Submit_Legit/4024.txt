Former critic plans 'Lobbyists for Trump' fundraiser<<<link>>#.Vx5WTIcvozM.twitter>
Washington Examiner - Gabby Morrongiello

A top Washington lobbyist who previously called Donald Trump "a joke," now plans to host a fundraiser for the Republican presidential front-runner in early June.

Jack Burkman of J.M. Burkman and Associates will host government relations professionals and other lobbyists in the D.C. suburb of Arlington, Va. on June 10 as part of his "Lobbyists for Trump" effort.

According to an advisory released Monday, Burkman intends to raise $200 million over the next six months for the leading GOP candidate to use should he make it to the general election.

Burkman's effort to fundraise for the New York billionaire comes seven months after the D.C. lobbyist took out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Daily News criticizing Trump and the other Republican presidential hopefuls at the time for not taking a firm stance against same-sex marriage.

"Donald Trump: You have no moral compass. You've been pro-choice, pro-life, pro-choice and now pro-life again," Burkman wrote in the ad.

He added, "You'd believe anything that would get you elected. You're a joke."

Burkman did not return the Washington Examiner's request for comment.
