*What:             INTERNET/PRINT =E2=80=93 NEWSWEEK*

When:              Thursday, 28 April

Where:             Via Phone

Format:            Q and A via phone

Who:               DWS and Taylor Wofford

Topic:              Profile of DWS

Questions:       1) Can she confirm the story about her husband giving her
a milkshake every morning when she was running for the Florida house?

2) Once the 2015 election is over, what's next for DWS? Would she like to
stay on as Organizationchair, or is 5 years enough?

3) How does she respond to her primary challenger's accusation that her
support of H.R. 4018 is tantamount to supporting predatory payday lenders?

4) What's an average day like in the life of DWS? What time does she wake
up? When does she go to bed?

5) Her primary challenger lays the blame for the Democrats' recent losses
in the senate, house and state legislatures at DWS's feet. How does she
respond to that? And how responsible, ultimately, is the Organizationchair for
democratic losses?
