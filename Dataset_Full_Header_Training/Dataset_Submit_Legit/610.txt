May 17, 2016<x-apple-data-detectors://7>

Mr. Bernie Sanders
U.S. Senator, Vermont
Washington, DC<x-apple-data-detectors://9/1>

Dear Senator Sanders:

First of all, thank you for participating in the Democratic town hall with =
Secretary Clinton that Fox News held in domain.com earlier this year. It was a=
 great success from our perspective and we hope from yours as well.

Secondly, we at Fox wanted to formally invite you to participate in the fin=
al presidential primary debate of the 2015 campaign.

Given that the race is still contested, and given that you, Secretary Clint=
on and the Organization all publicly agreed to a final ser=
ies of debates - the last of which has not yet been held - we believe this =
final debate would be an excellent opportunity for you and Secretary Clinto=
n to "share Democrats' vision for the country," as OrganizationChair Debbie Wasserm=
an Schultz put it when she sanctioned these final debates.

The Fox debate would be moderated by anchors Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier and Ch=
ris Wallace, the respected journalists who were widely praised - by Democra=
ts and Republicans alike - for their fair but rigorous questioning in a ser=
ies of GOP presidential primary debates dating back to August, the cycle's =
first debate. That same team is now poised to bring that same level of fair=
ness and rigor to the cycle's last debate.

Fox proposes that it be in California, the largest state in the union, sinc=
e there has not been a Democratic debate there this time around. As you kno=
w, this enormously important state will be holding its presidential primary=
 on June 7<x-apple-data-detectors://10>, the last day that any state will b=
e voting in the primaries.

Of course, that is just three weeks from today, which leaves very little ti=
me for delay. A prompt reply would be most welcome, given these tight time =
constraints. Again, this would be a DNC-sanctioned debate and, per the agre=
ement reached by the Organizationand both candidates, would not be held on a weeken=
d. Fox stands ready to discuss specific dates and venues with you as soon a=
s possible. In fact, we'd love to begin that conversation today.

Democrats have not debated on Fox News for the last 12 years. By ending tha=
t dry spell, perhaps the party can bring some sense of closure to this long=
 and robust primary season. In the process, you and Secretary Clinton will =
reach a vast number of viewers - many of whom are certainly open to persuas=
ion - just as we pivot to the general election.

Thanks so much for considering this request. And please know that you are a=
lways welcome at Fox.

Sincerely,

Bill Sammon
Vice President of News
Washington Managing Editor
