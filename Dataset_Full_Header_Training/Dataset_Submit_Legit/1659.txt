=E2=80=9CI think the only card she has is the woman=E2=80=99s card. She=E2=
=80=99s got nothing else going on,=E2=80=9D he said at Trump Tower. =E2=80=

nd the beautiful thing is women don=E2=80=99t like her, ok?=E2=80=9D

Earlier in the day, he boasted about actress Lena Dunham saying she=E2=80=

he=E2=80=99s the nominee, every single GOP candidate in a top-tier race wil=

only get 5 percent of the vote if she was a man? They might be able to duck=

r, Trump also brags about never changing diapers. He said Megyn Kelly had "=
blood coming out of her wherever" when she questioned him about his history=
 of calling women "disgusting animals" and "dogs." Bottom line: It will jus=
