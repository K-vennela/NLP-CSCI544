SL: What Some Had to Say About Trump's Incoherent Foreign Policy Remarks

Donald Trump proved today that a teleprompter can't help him sound reasonable or knowledgeable when it comes to foreign policy. He continues to lack the judgment, experience, and temperament to be our next commander-in-chief. The "new" Donald Trump is the same Donald Trump we have seen on the campaign trail over the past year -- a candidate that lacks details, alarms foreign leaders, and has no place in the White House.

Just look at what some had to say about Trump's incoherent foreign policy remarks:

@LindseyGrahamSC:<<<link>>> Not sure who is advising Trump on foreign policy but I can understand why he's not revealing their names.

@LindseyGrahamSC:<<<link>>> Question #1 for Trump: Are we sure the guy running the teleprompter has the pages in the right order? #notmakinganysense

@LindseyGrahamSC:<<<link>>> Question #2 -- Did teleprompter guy actually write the speech? #notmakinganysense

@LindseyGrahamSC:<<<link>>> Trump speech is pathetic in terms of understanding the role America plays in the world, how to win War on Terror, and threats we face.

@timkmak<<<link>>>: How can such a prewritten, rehearsed speech be filled with so many errors and internal contradictions

@timkmak:<<<link>>> Trump's contradiction:
--Allies must pay for their own defense
--We must stick by our agreement with allies (just not security assurances)

@fmkaplan: <<<link>>> Even by Trump standards, this is thumpingly incoherent and ignorant.

@JakeSherman:<<<link>>> Donald Trump just called Tanzania "Tanzaynia"

@cathleendecker: <<<link>>> Shorter Trump: Obama/Clinton bad, I'm good, and I need more TelePrompter practice. And words like "total disaster" are mine not writer's.

@joshgreenman:<<<link>>>

1. Start trade war with China

2. Seek common ground based on shared interests with China

@ThePlumLineGS:<<<link>>> After saying we need to be more "unpredictable," Trump says the secret to successful foreign policy is consistency.

@BenjySarlin: <<<link>>> After literally threatening to end alliances over a funding dispute, Trump pivots to saying our allies no longer think they can depend on us

@alivitali: <<<link>>> So far this seems like a referendum on Obama's foreign policy and less of what Trump's own FP would look like.

@ZekeJMiller: <<<link>>> The big question hanging over pretty much every line of this Trump speech: How?

@thefix: <<<link>>> To say this Trump foreign policy speech is light on specifics is an insult to specifics.

@WayneSlater:<<<link>>> Trump reading his foreign policy address off the Teleprompter looks like a 10-year-old trying to speak in a second language.

@BenjySarlin:<<<link>>> Trump just seems to staple GOP talking points about foreign policy onto his own foreign policy, which is totally incompatible with them
