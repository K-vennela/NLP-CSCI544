4.27.16 TALKING POINTS

Topline Message:

Yesterday Americans in five states went to the polls, with Democrats voting=
 with enthusiasm for the candidate they like most =96 and Republicans holdi=
ng their noses and casting their votes for the candidate they dislike least=
.

=B7         In Pennsylvania, domain.com polling showed that 71 percent of Democra=
tic voters felt their primary had energized the party while 58 percent of R=
epublican voters said their primary had divided the party. That=92s what we=
 saw in New York, where just 39% of Republicans thought their campaign has =
energized their party while in Wisconsin 4 out of 10 Republican primary vot=
ers said they fear what a Trump presidency would do to our country. And rou=
ghly a third would rather stay home, vote for a third party, or vote for a =
Democrat than support either Trump or Cruz.

=B7         That=92s stunning, but it tells you that Democrats are heading =
into November in a far stronger position than Republicans.
For years, GOP leaders have pushed a cynical and feckless political strateg=
y that exploits unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LG=
BT community and more, all for political gain. They have sold hardworking A=
mericans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while strangling Ame=
rica=92s middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich tho=
se already at the top. Donald Trump=92s impending nomination after Tuesday=
=92s results is the ultimate, sad culmination of the success of that strate=
gy. Trump is the modern Republican Party.

It=92s clear that when we get through our conventions, Democrats will emerg=
e united having nominated the next president, while the GOP will have to wa=
llow in the chaotic mess of their own making.

Trump Promises to Be Trump, Cruz and Kasich Prove GOP =3D Broken Government

=B7         It=92s hard to pick what=92s been a stranger story the past wee=
k --  Trump empowering his new advisor to calm the RNC by saying he would c=
hange his ways but then changing his mind, or Ted Cruz and John Kasich devi=
sing a pact and having it fall apart almost right away.

=B7         When Donald Trump said in his remarks last night that he=92s no=
t =93playing a part=94 and that he=92s =93not changing,=94 that his =93thou=
ght process is the same,=94 believe him.

=B7         He=92ll continue to be the divisive, offensive Republican candi=
date who lacks the judgment and temperament to lead.

=B7         And when Cruz and Kasich proved they can=92t even coordinate wi=
th each other, well it=92s a reminder that the Republican vision of smaller=
 government is broken government. Hardly surprising given that Ted Cruz=92s=
 biggest accomplishment was shutting down the government and costing the ec=
onomy $24 billion.

Chaos in Cleveland vs Our Next President in Philadelphia

We=92re less than 100 days from the July conventions, and it=92s clear that=
 Democrats will emerge united, while Republicans are embroiled in drama bet=
ter suited for a reality show than a contest for the presidency.

Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are dedicated to supporting the eve=
ntual Democratic nominee.

=B7         Just yesterday, Senator Sanders said at a town hall on MSNBC th=
at he will do everything in his power to make sure no Republican gets into =
the White House in November.

=B7         And Secretary Clinton has been clear about her commitment to un=
ifying the party and the need to build on the progress we=92ve made under D=
emocratic leadership over the last 7 years.

=B7         Because the Party=92s platform is a statement of our values, th=
e Organizationis committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both o=
f our campaigns will be represented on the Platform Drafting Committee, and=
 just as we did in 2015 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to par=
ticipate.

Democrats know that we=92re stronger when more voices are heard, and when w=
e stand together to move our country forward, we=92ll see that in Philadelp=
hia at our convention.

Compare that to the Republicans.

=B7         This week, the increasingly desperate Cruz and Kasich campaigns=
 forged an unusual alliance to stop Trump, but it barely lasted as long as =
the announcement that it was happening.

=B7         A majority of Trump supporters said they would abandon the Repu=
blican Party if he loses the nomination and runs as a third-party candidate=
.

=B7         Even Republican leaders are afraid of going near their radioact=
ive convention. You=92ve already seen Republican candidates in tight races,=
 like Senator Kirk in Illinois and John McCain =96 the GOP nominee eight ye=
ars ago =96 say they will not attend their own convention in Cleveland. But=
 don=92t let them fool you, they=92re not any better than the top of their =
ticket.

Joint Fundraising Committees

=B7         We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for=
 the Organizationand state parties, which is why stood up similar agreements for jo=
int victory funds with both the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign e=
arly in the cycle.

=B7         The Organizationis the only entity that will be able to closely coordin=
ate with our eventual nominee, and we took these important steps because of=
 the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure NOW that will help e=
lect Democrats up and down the ballot in November.

=B7         It=92s important to note, the funds that the Organizationand state part=
ies get through the joint victory funds help strengthen, for example, our n=
ational voter file and communications, research and digital support for sta=
te parties and down ballot candidates. That includes training across a vari=
ety of areas, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid respons=
e support. This is helping us build infrastructure for the general election=
.

=B7         These arrangements are not new or unusual. Similar joint fundra=
ising committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 200=
8 and 2012. And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of=
 using joint victory funds.

=B7         And let=92s be clear, neither the Organizationnor state parties are sub=
sidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign. For what=
ever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campa=
ign, that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that=
 fundraising.

Contested Convention / Arizona domain.com

=B7         We=92re going to be united at our convention, and we=92re confi=
dent in our process, which was in place well before we knew who would run t=
his cycle and which has been fair to all of our candidates.

=B7         We=92ve cautioned our candidates to maintain a tone that helps =
us build toward the general election, recognizing that as we funnel down th=
e home stretch of any campaign the intensity level will rise.

=B7         Ultimately, Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders are drawing s=
harp differences with one another, but their differences remain focused on =
how to best move America forward.

=B7         They=92re focused on how to make sure our government reflects t=
he values of the American people, that we have an economy and a democracy t=
hat are inclusive, and that we respect everyone in America.

=B7         If you want to talk about a rigged process, we=92re doing that =
too. The Organization and our Senatorial Campaign Committe=
e are suing officials in Arizona whose decisions led to voters having to wa=
it for hours to vote during their March primaries, and many to be disenfran=
chised as a result. We want to make sure that doesn=92t happen in November.

=B7         If you want to talk about rigging elections, that=92s the real =
example, and it=92s a serious problem and we=92re glad both our candidates =
have expressed interest addressing attempts to make it harder for the Ameri=
can people to vote.

=B7         In Maricopa County, officials reduced the number of polling loc=
ations to just 1 for every 21,000 people. That=92s seven times what it was =
in other parts of the state, and it shows you the magnitude of the efforts =
to make it harder to vote that Republicans are championing all across the c=
ountry.

=B7         And it=92s not just Arizona, you had a member of Congress from =
Wisconsin, Glenn Grothman, who flat out said that they expected they could =
now win Wisconsin because of the Voter ID law. It was his Kevin McCarthy mo=
ment, and the type of rigging of the system we=92re not going to put up wit=
h.

=B7         When voters go to the polls in November, they can be certain th=
at the Democratic nominee will have the temperament and judgment to serve a=
s commander in chief, and that's not something you can say about the Republ=
ican candidates.

Clinton=92s Speeches and Sanders=92 Taxes

=B7         Our job at the Party isn=92t to handicap our own primary, we=92=
re not going to referee.

=B7         There are real differences, but they=92re with the Republicans,=
 and while you have to expect that the candidates are going to draw sharp d=
ifferences, they=92re also highlighting what a much better option voters ha=
ve with Democrats.

=B7         Just look at the issue of taxes as millions of Americans filed =
last week, but most of them didn=92t get to take advantage of special looph=
oles or get special breaks. Yet every single Republican plan for the econom=
y is based on tax cuts for those at the very top of the income scale. It=92=
s exactly the economic policy that the Bush Administration had as they drov=
e us toward the great recession.

=B7         So ultimately those are the differences that will matter most i=
n November.

GOP Frontrunner Trump is Reckless and Dangerous

=B7         The Economy: Trump=92s unfounded predictions<<<link>>
m/2016/04/03/trump-predicts-very-massive-recession-in-us.html> of recession=

ortant military alliances<<<link>>

 in light of his past praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

=B7         Nuclear Proliferation: Trump has refused to say he wouldn=92t u=
se nuclear weapons on European territory, then suggested South Korea<http:/=
/domain.com/2016/04/04/his_most_terrifying_interview_yet_why_trumps_sit_=
down_with_bob_woodward_should_have_america_petrified/> and Japan should eit=
her develop nuclear weapons or pay the United States for protection against=
 North Korea.

=B7         On abortion: Trump has taken multiple positions on abortion - f=
rom a dangerous and offensive call to punish women who get an abortion, to =
saying he would allow states to restrict women=92s rights, to saying aborti=
on laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial appointments.

Cruz

=B7         The vast majority of his Republican colleagues can barely muste=
r a straight face to say anything nice or positive about him!

=B7         Lindsey Graham crassly talked about how no one in the Senate wo=
uld object if he was killed on the Senate floor, and said that endorsing hi=
m over Trump was the equivalent of choosing to get poisoned over being shot=
.

=B7         Senator Jim Risch of Idaho =96 TWICE =96 gave one of the most p=
assive, non-endorsement endorsements I=92ve ever seen.

=B7         It=92s going to be very difficult for Senators and Congress mem=
bers to run alongside a presidential nominee they really don=92t like!

The GOP=92s Problem with Women Voters

Trump is viewed unfavorably by 7 out of 10 women, but both of his primary o=
pponents would also alienate women voters with their policies as the nomine=
e.

=B7         Kasich said that he wants to see Roe v. Wade repealed<<<link>>
domain.com/watch?v=3DlAoKQM1sv0M&feature=3Dyoutu.be>, and when asked wh=
at kind of punishment that would lead to, he evaded the question by saying =
that it should be left to the states.

=B7         Cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped, she sho=
uld be forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to term.

=B7         In the past, the Republican candidates have opposed equal pay, =
family leave, and voted against the Violence Against Women Act.

Earlier this month we marked Equal Pay Day, the day in 2015 when women=92s =
earnings have caught up with men=92s earnings from 2015. On average we earn=
 79 cents to their dollar, and it=92s worse for women of color. All of the =
Republican presidential candidates would stand against protections that ens=
ure greater equality in the workplace.

=B7         John Kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we d=
on=92t need workplace protections, just a =91change of heart=92 among major=
 employers.

=B7         Ted Cruz voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act three times an=
d ridiculed the legislation as a =91show vote.=92

=B7         Donald Trump stated that women would have pay equity if we did =
=91as good a job=92 as men.

Republicans to Blame for Trump and His Down Ballot Impact

It=92s fitting that Donald Trump is the standard-bearer of a party that has=
 relied on divisive politics and scapegoating for electoral gain for so lon=
g. Since 2015 they=92ve used gay marriage as a wedge issue, demonized immig=
rants and stoked fears about border security. They=92ve given birthers like=
 Trump a pass, and fueled the Tea Party with lies about a total government =
takeover of healthcare and the economy. Then while in office, the only thin=
g Republicans have done in Washington over the last seven years is obstruct=
. Trump IS the Republican Party.

Advantage, Democrats

Despite all the media attention that Republican frontrunner Trump gets with=
 his say-anything strategy, Democrats are winning where it matters.

=B7         Senator Clinton has earned more than 10 million votes =96 Over =
a million more than Donald Trump =96 while Senator Sanders has  earned more=
 than 8 million votes (well ahead of Ted Cruz and John Kasich), while also =
garnering more than seven million individual campaign contributions from lo=
w dollar donors. If there is an enthusiasm gap, it clearly favors Democrats=
.

=B7         Overall fundraising shows a Democratic edge, with Democrats rai=
sing a total of $72.1 million in February and 67.5 million in March, eclips=
ing Republicans=92 fundraising, which amounted to less than $12 million for=
 Cruz, $6<<<link>>> million for =
Trump, and just $3.4 million for Kasich in February.

=B7         And while Trump continues to claim that he is self-funding his =
campaign, his latest report with the FEC<<<link>>
1603209011931050/201603209011931050.pdf> shows that he has loaned his campa=
ign $24 million throughout this election cycle, while he raising just $34 m=
illion from outside contributors and loans for the entire cycle.

=B7         Democrats will have the strongest candidate in November. Period=
. And we are poised to take back the Senate and make serious gains in the H=
ouse.

Broad Contrast and Infrastructure

=B7         We have been building an infrastructure and operation that will=
 work regardless of who the Republicans nominate. We see the numbers of cou=
rse; it=92s clear Trump is far ahead of his competitors, and we=92re ready =
for him if he makes it through what is shaping up to be a train wreck of a =
convention.

=B7         But we don=92t think taking on Trump is fundamentally different=
 from any of the others.

=B7         At least with Trump, he=92s not shy about exposing what the Rep=
ublican brand has truly become. Ted Cruz and John Kasich are every bit as e=
xtreme as their party=92s front-runner, they just hide it a bit better.

=B7         They promise the same extreme agenda on women=92s rights, they =
deny the threat of climate change, and they oppose fixing a broken immigrat=
ion system with a path to  citizenship.

=B7         They all want to drag America back to the failed economic polic=
ies of the last Republican president who left office losing 800,000 jobs a =
month and having plunged our country into the Great Recession.

=B7         And they=92ve all been just as offensive in their rhetoric, usi=
ng language that alienates our allies, helps ISIS domain.com terrorists, and m=
akes America less safe.

=B7         So if it is Trump, we=92re ready. Maybe it=92s Cruz, but it=92s=
 hard to see how that comes together in the end. But regardless we=92re bui=
lding a ground game and an infrastructure that=92s ready to challenge him o=
n every single position he=92s taking on the campaign trail, and that holds=
 him accountable for what those positions would actually mean for the Ameri=
can people.
