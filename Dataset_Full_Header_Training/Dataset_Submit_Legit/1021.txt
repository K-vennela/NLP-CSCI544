Subject: [sample] I've never been prouder to be a Democrat

Keith --

The Republican Party has a new leader: Donald Trump. I can't think of a tim=
e in my life when I've been prouder to be a Democrat -- or more committed t=
o building a strong party.

Consider Trump's stated goals for his first 100 days in office: He plans to=
 undo some of President Obama's most important accomplishments, like the Af=
fordable Care Act and executive orders on immigration, and he promises to a=
ppoint a Scalia-like justice to the Supreme Court to rip away our dearest p=
rogress, like marriage equality and a woman's right to choose.

Keith, we absolutely cannot let those things happen. We need to protect and=
 build on President Obama's legacy -- for our shared values, and for the fu=
ture of the country we love. Your $10 contribution to the Democratic Nation=
al Committee today will do just that -- can you help?
If you've saved your payment information, your donation will go through imm=
ediately.

As Democrats, we have a very different vision for our country, from protect=

mum wage and confronting climate change as a nation. We know that there are=
 no magic solutions -- we get things done by rolling up our sleeves and put=
ting in hard work.

That starts with working to elect Democrats all across this country, to pro=

We can't win this fight without you, Keith. Chip in now -- the world is cou=
