PAUL RYAN'S BIG RISK
------------------------------------------------------------
For most of the prominent Republicans snubbing Donald Trump=2C there's lit=
tle risk. President George H.W. Bush=2C President George W. Bush and 2012=
 GOP nominee Mitt Romney aren't on any ballot.

But House Speaker Paul Ryan has something to lose. He needs broad support=
 in the House Republican Conference to keep his job=2C as conservatives ma=
de very clear when they pushed his predecessor=2C John Boehner (R-Ohio)=2C=
 toward retirement last year. Trump=2C on the other hand=2C now has the su=
pport of most of the Republican voters across the country =E2=80=94 the pe=
ople who elect the representatives who form Ryan's constituency in the Hou=
se. That is=2C Trump is bigger than Ryan right now.

That's one of the reasons it was surprising when Ryan told CNN's Jake Tapp=
er yesterday that he's "not ready" to support the presumptive Republican p=
residential nominee. And it's one of the reasons why Republican insiders o=
utside his office predicted to Stitch that Ryan's resistance to Trump will=
 be short-lived.

Politico's JAKE SHERMAN gets behind the scenes in Ryan's office to explain=
 that the speaker's positioning was both deliberate and decided on hastily=
=2C arrived at on a conference call Wednesday morning. More important=2C J=
ake tugs at the underlying tension for Ryan=2C who has his own conscience=
=2C the need to provide cover for Trump-wary colleagues and a future presi=
dential run to think about.
------------------------------------------------------------

"Ryan has ruled out launching a white-knight bid for president this year=
=2C and giving Trump the stiff arm isn't likely to change that calculus. B=
ut the speaker has acknowledged that a bid in 2015 is possible and=2C inte=
ntional or not=2C this could be part of an effort to pick up the pieces if=
 Republicans lose the White House this fall."

-ryan-donald-trump-222870#ixzz47rq8acvy)

------------------------------------------------------------
Here's what Ryan said to Tapper about endorsing Trump:
------------------------------------------------------------

"I'm just not ready to do that at this point. I'm not there right now. ...=
 Saying we're unified doesn't in and of itself unify us=2C but actually ta=
king the principles that we all believe in=2C showing that there's a dedic=
ation to those=2C and running a principled campaign that Republicans can b=
e proud about and that can actually appeal to a majority of Americans -- t=
hat=2C to me=2C is what it takes to unify this party."

=E2=80=94Paul Ryan/CNN (<<link>>
a141ea21c7252826493e5fa33be671e)

------------------------------------------------------------
Trump fired back in a statement that contained both an olive branch and a=
 reminder about the .
------------------------------------------------------------

"I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda. Perhaps in the future we=
 can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the Ame=
rican people. They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about=
 time for politicians to put them first!""

=E2=80=94Donald Trump/CNN (<<link>>
s/6a141ea21c7252826493e5fa33be671e)

------------------------------------------------------------
It didn't take long for Trump's allies to threaten Ryan's job.
------------------------------------------------------------

=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m not ready to support Speaker Ryan anymore. ... I=E2=
=80=99m thinking we may need a new speaker.=E2=80=9D

------------------------------------------------------------
Republican strategist RON CHRISTIE said on Sidewire last night that Ryan=
=2C who has been building a Republican agenda=2C will continue to be in th=
e public eye in the near future.
------------------------------------------------------------

"Trump could be a disaster for the GOP on a presidential level but Ryan ha=
s held his caucus together in difficult budget/appropriations fights. Expe=
ct the Speaker to speak more on the national stage in days to come."

=E2=80=94Ron Christie/Sidewire (<<link>>

-36baf45315d5)

------------------------------------------------------------
If Ryan's successful=2C he'll get Trump to adopt core party principles tha=
t Trump hasn't embraced so far=2C make it easier for House Republicans to=
 run with Trump and elevate his own standing in advance of the next presid=
ential election without a Republican incumbent.

But if he fails=2C he'll further divide his party=2C diminish his own stan=
ding and=2C the longer it goes on=2C potentially put his job in jeopardy.=
 It's obviously not easy to take on Trump right now.

Republicans who spoke to Stitch lean heavily toward Ryan backing down =E2=
=80=94 and fast.

HOW THE WHITE HOUSE DUPED EVERYONE ON THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL
------------------------------------------------------------
DAVID SAMUELS of the New York Times magazine gets inside the thinking of D=
eputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes=2C the most influential foreign=
 policy aide to President Barack Obama=2C in a lengthy profile that has so=
me in the national security establishment upset over revelations of just h=
ow Rhodes and his team sold the Iran nuclear deal.

The upshot is that Rhodes created a narrative that elections in Iran broug=
ht in a more moderate regime that was open to reaching an agreement on ter=
ms more favorable to the U.S.=2C a storyline that made the pact more domain.com=
ically palatable and obscured the most consequential intentions. The truth=
=2C Samuels reports=2C is that most of the terms had been worked out in 20=
12=2C before the election and long before there was any public discussion=
 of it. Rhodes and his team used friendly think-tankers and mostly unwitti=
ng reporters to sell a false tale to the American public about the origin=
 and meaning of the agreement=2C he writes.
------------------------------------------------------------

"By eliminating the fuss about Iran=E2=80=99s nuclear program=2C the admin=
istration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the tw=
o countries=2C which would create the space for America to disentangle its=
elf from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Ara=
bia=2C Egypt=2C Israel and Turkey. With one bold move=2C the administratio=
n would effectively begin the process of a large-scale disengagement from=
 the Middle East."

------------------------------------------------------------
You have to read the whole story (<<link>>
ne/the-aspiring-novelist-who-became-obamas-foreign-policy-guru.html?_r=3D1=
)  to get a real feel for the level of manipulation =E2=80=94 and the spec=
ific journalists who were manipulated =E2=80=94 in the selling of the Iran=
 deal.
------------------------------------------------------------
The conservative writer JOHN PODHORETZ nails why the seemingly glowing pro=
file of Rhodes is a double-edged sword.
------------------------------------------------------------

"Little did these denizens of Rhodes=E2=80=99 echo chamber know their loya=
lty would be seen as servility and would become the subject of post-victor=
y gloating. 'We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry=
 our message effectively=2C and how to use outside groups like Ploughshare=
s=2C the Iran Project and whomever else=2C' Rhodes says [in the Samuels p=
iece]. 'So we knew the tactics that worked.'"

------------------------------------------------------------
In other Middle East news=2C JOSH ROGIN & ELI LAKE of Bloomberg View write=
 about a shift in U.S. officials' posture toward Egyptian President Abdul=
 Fattah el-Sisi. They used to attack him publicly for a poor human-rights=
 record=2C but now=2C fearing instability in the region=2C Obama administr=
ation officials and leading Republican senators have changed their tune.
------------------------------------------------------------

"I think he is somebody we can do business with. I think he=E2=80=99s the=
 right guy at the right time=2C but his actions will determine if I=E2=80=
=99m right or wrong. ... We all understand that Sisi is not perfect=2C but=

VEEPSTAKES!

hey are among the high-profile Republicans who aren't ruling it out. Neith=
er is NEWT GINGRICH.

And=2C of course=2CCHRIS CHRISTIE has been considered a potential running=
 mate since he started appearing at Trump's side after dropping out of the=
 presidential race.

That is=2C for all the folks who are saying they won't run with Trump=2C t=
here are a lot who are leaving that option open if not openly auditioning=
 for the job.

"I am going to be open to any way I can help. I am not going to say no. ..=

"I have no idea what his thinking is right now. I don't have any interest=
 in the sense that I'm going to go out and try to become his vice presiden=
t. I would obviously have to listen carefully if he called. He's an old fr=
