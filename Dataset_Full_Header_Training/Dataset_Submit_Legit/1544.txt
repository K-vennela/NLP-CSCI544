This Week on the Campaign Trail

Overview

With his lock on the Republican nomination, Donald Trump has ensured that his Party's problems won't be limited to convention chaos-- he's going to force GOP candidates in races big and small across the country to own his ugly, divisive and dangerous rhetoric all the way to the general election.

That's why GOP party leaders have started to fret publicly about their party's deepening divides, and stumble with no real strategy for embracing their standard bearer. You may have missed it, but 2015 is going so badly for the RNC, they put out a second autopsy<<<link>>>. Sad!

For years, the Republican Party has elevated extreme voices using divisive campaigns and now they're stuck with Trump. Over the last few weeks, domain.com polls have confirmed that Republicans believe their primary has been divisive, while three fourths of Democrats are excited about our primaries and would support either of our candidates.

This week, Trump showed he has no interest in being forthright with the American people. His refusal to release his tax returns, as well as his false claim that voters would learn nothing from them has set off fresh criticism from all sides<<<link>>>.

A new Organizationvideo highlights his refusal to release his tax returns, as well as his false claim that voters would learn nothing from them. Trump is simply not being honest with the American people and lacks the temperament to be president.

What people are writing in the states

Donald Trump's meeting with GOP leadership this week showed that while Trump and Ryan may have a personal disagreement, they are both pushing the same divisive and dangerous agenda. This week, Democrats around the country have shown that from now until November 8th, we're going to hold Republicans up and down the ballot accountable for their divisive and dangerous policies.
