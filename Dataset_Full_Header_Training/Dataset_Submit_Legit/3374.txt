Orange County Democrats to GOP: Bring it on<<<link>>>
By SEEMA MEHTA<<<link>>>, LOS ANGELES TIMES

As national Republicans leaders prepare to open a training office in Orange County on Wednesday, Democrats are responding by noting that the one-time GOP stronghold is no longer the bastion of California conservatism it once was.

Republicans still hold an 8-point advantage over Democrats in the percentage of registered voters in the county, but that lead is about one-third what it was in 1992. And since Donald Trump<<<link>>> became a force in the presidential contest, twice as many Democrats have registered to vote than Republicans, according to the Democratic Party of Orange County.

"Although our local party has worked hard to make significant inroads with targeted registration programs the past several years, the truth is, Donald Trump has become our best marketing tool," said party Chairman Henry Vandermeir. "He's insulted pretty much every constituency in this county, which has helped drive Democratic registration to new highs."

Vandermeir made the comments on the eve of the opening of a Republican Leadership Initiative office in Stanton. The initiative was formed in 2015 to domain.com and train field staffers to supplement party get-out-the-vote efforts in key states and has so far trained nearly 3,000 fellows.

Just got off phone with CA reporter, who said that OC GOP Chairman told him Priebus' trip to OC was no longer happening.

Will look to get additional confirmation.
