Dear Vonage Member,

 We have reason to belive that your Vonage Account has been fraudulently accessed by a third party using other ISP(domain.com Service Provider).

 This might have happened due to the following reasons:

- You accessed your account from a different computer or you have changed your Operating System.

- You have dynamic IP address and due to that our system might have interpretated it as a hacking attempt.

- You entered a wrong password 3 times when you tried to connect to your Vonage Account.

 Please understand that your account is safe but is currently suspended.

 This suspension can be easily removed by logging in, by clicking here or the link below:

<<link>>

*We will check your IP address, time zone, and if all matches, your account was never fraudulently accessed.

 We are very sorry if this affects you in any way but our clients'security is a top priority for Vonage.

Regards,

Vonage Security Team.
