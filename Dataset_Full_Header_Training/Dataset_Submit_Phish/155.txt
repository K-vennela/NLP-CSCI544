    important to us. To celebrate our 156th anniversary, we're rewarding our

    received money through Western Union, you've been selected!

To be eligible to win the prize, go to 
<<link>>  - sign in

You will be contacted by phone by a Western Union representative in the 
    next 24 hours and you will receive the $2000 prize in less than 3 business 
    days. Your personal and billing information is required for receiving the 
    money directly to your bank account.
Save time, send money, earn rewards! Western Union is a service people 
    trust.
