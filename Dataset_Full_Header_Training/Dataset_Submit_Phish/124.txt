A message from Chase Card Services Fraud Department




Dear Card Member, 

Due to the recent phishing attacks and
attempted identity theft associated with them, we have decided
to verify identity of
our members. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but we feel
that
is a necessary precaution to protect our members personal identity
information.

We recently attempt to verify some recent transactions on your
account.

After we have made the verification we were unable to confirm your
personal identity information we have
on file. You will need to update your
information in order to maintain online services. Click here to log-in
Chase Online(SM) any day of the week,
complete all the we need to establish your identity. For your
protection, we require
an exact match between the information we have on file and the information that
you
will confirm.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you, but these
steps are necessary to protect you
and your JPMorgan Chase accounts. There is no need
to call us in response to a phone message we've
left in the last three days unless
you see any transactions you don't recognize. We thank you for
choosing JPMorgan
Chase as your financial services provider and look forward to hearing from you
very
soon.
