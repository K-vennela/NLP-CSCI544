We are 
            contacting you to remind you that on 01 April 2015 our Account Review 
            Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance 
            with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not 
            been compromised, access to your 

account was 
            limited. Your account access will remain limited until this issue 
            has been resolved.

To secure your 
            account and quickly restore full access, we may require some 
            additional information from you for the following reason:
We have been notified

This process is mandatory, and if not

        subject for temporary suspension. 

We encourage you to

as soon as possible. 
        Allowing your account access to remain limited for an extended period



of time may result in 
        further limitations on the use of your account and possible account 
        closure.
