Hey,

   Writing to let you know my trip to London, United Kingdom, has been  
terrible trip, I came down here to London, United Kingdom, for a  
Voluntary Training Program (VTP) unfortunately we were mugged at the  
park of the  hotel where we stayed,all cash and domain.com card were  
stolen off us but luckily for us we still have our passports with us.

We've been to the Embassy and the Police here but they're not helping  
issues at all the Embassy only cleared me of my traveling documents  
since I came in on unofficial purposes and our flight leaves in few  
hours from now but we're having problems settling the hotel bills and  
the hotel manager  won't let us leave until we settle the bills. Well  
I really need your financially assistance..Please, let me know if you  
can help us out?, all I need is $ 1,850 I'll refund it to you as soon  
as we arrive home just need to clear our Hotel bills and get the next  
plane home, As soon as we get home I'll refund it immediately.You can  
wire the money to me through Via Western Union all you need is the  
Name on my Passport ID and location below.

My details is confirmed below:

Receiver name: Jyothi Rao
Location: 28 Great Sutton St,London EC1V 0DR,United Kingdom
Amount: $1,850

As soon as it is done,kindly get back to me with the WU Confirmation  
Number,cos that's all I will be needing in picking up the money over  
here with my Passport ID...Let me know if you are heading  to the WU  
outlet now???

Best Regards,

Jyothi.
