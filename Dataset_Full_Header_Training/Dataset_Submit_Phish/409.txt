Marketplace Safety 
                              Tip 

Never pay for your e.Bay 
                              item using instant case wire transfer services 
                              through Western Union or MoneyGram. These payment 
                              methods are unsafe when paying someone you don't 
                              know. Learn more about sending 
                              payments.
