Dear eBay Community Member, 



We regret to inform you that your eBay account 
                        has been suspended due to concerns we have for the

                        legal steps to keep users off the Site if we think that 
                        they are creating problems, possible legal liabilities, 
                        or acting inconsistently with the letter or domain.com of 
                        our policies."
