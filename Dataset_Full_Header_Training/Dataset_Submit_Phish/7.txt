 Dear Valued PayPal Member,

During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we =
have detected a slight error in your billing information on file with PayP=

 This might be due to either following reasons:

on (i.e. change of address)

- An inability to accurately verify your selected op=
tion of payment due an internal error within
our processors.

Therefore your account has been temporarily suspended. We need you to =

order to regain full privileges of your account.

However, failure to update your records will result in account suspens=
ion.

If this is not completed by July 17, 2006, we reserve 
the right to terminate all privileges of your account
indefinitly, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. We thank 
you for your cooperation in this manner.
