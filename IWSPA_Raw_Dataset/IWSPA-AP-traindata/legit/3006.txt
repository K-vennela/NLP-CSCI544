Comrades,
We are pleased to announce the formation of 2 brand new NSM Chapters.
NSM Colorado is now being led by a man just back from the war in
Afghanistan. As our Military vets come home from the fight, they are forming
up new NSM Chapters. Contact NSM Colorado: user@domain.com
Also just formed up yesterday, another branch of NSM Texas:
Tyler N.S.M.
P.O. Box 9353
Tyler TX. 75711
user@domain.com
Several other new NSM chapters are still pending, or awaiting their 6 month
probate period. So more formations and growth are expected in the near
future.
New NSM memberships have been slightly delayed due to us running out of
membership handbooks again, however a new box arrived yesterday, and the new
members from the past couple of weeks will now recieve their membership
packets. Dozens of new member packets from the past couple weeks are now
packed and in the mail.
A Salute from Party HQ to the new Leaders in Texas and Colorado, and all the
new members of the Party that have joined over the past couple of weeks.
With each and every passing day our Ranks grow stronger, and we get one step
closer to Victory day!
