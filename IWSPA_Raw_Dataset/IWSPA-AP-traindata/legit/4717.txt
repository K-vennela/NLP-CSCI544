Hi all
On isotopes, see the paper by Werner et al (briefly discussed in our 
Science perspectives) showing that isotopes don't sample the deep winter 
well as there is inadequate precip then in Greenland during the past.
I had to send this as I have been getting 2 of everything and I so I 
adjusted the cc list.
