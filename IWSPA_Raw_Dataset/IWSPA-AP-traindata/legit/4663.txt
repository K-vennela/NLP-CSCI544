Dear Jorge,
Happy for you to use me in an additional attempt tp get some Mexican support
to come to CRU next year.  What exactly do you need?  Send me an example of
what you want?  Life is very busy here at the moment as I'll be away for several
meetings over the next 6 weeks and I must prepare some material for most of them.
GKSS is just one model and it is a model, so there is no need for it to be correct.
I am also aware that Ed Cook is revising the ECS curve in a paper he's submitting
to Quaternary Science Reviews.
Remember that if ECS (and GKSS) are correct then the climate is more sensitive
to external forcing (the factors that cause past changes/variability). If the climate is
more sensitive then the likely changes in the future will be greater. The curves that
we've produced here (and also Mike Mann's) suggest a climate sensitivity of about
2.5 deg C for a CO2 doubling. Getting volcanic forcing right in the past (along with
solar)
are crucial in any study.
Cheers
Phil
