it from the airport):  The cover email is fine.  As I understand, we'll be =
doing some hiring directly ourselves, but we will also be sending resumes o=
f good candidates in some instances for hiring directly by the state partie=
s.
I would add "disclaimer" language to the splash page itself (or on the appl=
ication form itself)-for people who are clicking through from this email-th=
at informs them that by submitting an application to the DNC, they authoriz=
e the DNC to share their application with state democratic parties, who may=
contact the applicant directly regarding potential employment as a field o=
rganizer with the state party.
