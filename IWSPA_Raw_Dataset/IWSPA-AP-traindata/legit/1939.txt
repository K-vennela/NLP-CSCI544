ELECTION CLIPS
2016 - Presidential
Democratic Party Candidates
Hillary Clinton
Clinton and Sanders spar over joint fundraising efforts<<<link>>>
Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaign spent part of Monday fighting over how much money the front-runner's operation has actually raised for state parties, with Sanders' campaign charging Clinton with "laundering" donations. Both Democratic campaigns have signed joint fundraising efforts with the Democratic National Committee, allowing the presidential campaigns to raise money for the Democratic committee and a host of state Democratic parties. Because of federal election rules, campaigns are allowed to raise upwards of $350,000 from individuals for joint fundraising efforts. But Clinton has been the only candidate to use it, raising, according to her campaign, $46 million for the DNC and state parties through the Hillary Victory Fund, the Clinton campaign's joint fundraising effort.
Bernie Sanders
Hoarse but Energetic, Bernie Sanders Presses for Votes in Indiana<<<link>>>
Bernie Sanders capped off a day of campaigning around Indiana on Monday with a boisterous and energetic rally in downtown Indianapolis. Mr. Sanders's voice sounded particularly hoarse as he railed against income inequality, with many of his supporters reciting parts of his now familiar speech along with him. The rally was one of three he held in Indiana on Monday to court the state's voters, who go to the polls on Tuesday, and stress the state's importance in his push to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Although the chances have narrowed for the Vermont senator, his supporters were as lively as ever on Monday night, shouting his name and waving signs throughout his speech.
Republican Party Candidates
Ted Cruz
Ted Cruz scrambles to reverse fortunes in Indiana<<<link>>>
Ted Cruz has everything he wanted in Indiana: A one-on-one match-up with rival Donald Trump in a conservative state with a supportive governor and an announced running-mate, Carly Fiorina, at his side. But on Monday, Cruz is racing to reverse polls that showed him trailing. "I trust the people of Indiana to differentiate ... We are not a bitter, angry, petty, bigoted people. That is not America. I reject that vision of America," Cruz said in Osceola. "We are not an angry, ugly people, and the people of Indiana -- the people of Indiana have good judgment, have good values. The people of Indiana are the heartland of this country, and we have a choice -- we have a choice about our national character; who we will be."
John Kasich
Indiana may end Kasich's presidential dream<<<link>>>
If things go as forecast in today's Indiana primary, the pressure on John Kasich to give up his presidential dream is likely to increase dramatically. That's because Donald Trump will have all but sewn up a victory before July's GOP convention in Cleveland - turning the governor's quest from long-shot to all-but-impossible. If Trump sweeps the Hoosier State, he would have to win only about 40 percent of the delegates in the handful of remaining states to attain the 1,237 needed to mathematically clinch the nomination. "If we win Indiana, it's over," Trump proclaimed.
Donald Trump
The Last Chance to Stop Donald Trump?<<<link>>>
It's primary day in Indiana (all polls close by 7 p.m. Eastern), where Ted Cruz's best hope is to keep Donald Trump from 1,237 delegates and force a contested convention. But things are not looking up for Cruz, who is finding that barnstorming the state, picking a veep and millions in television ads aren't enough to overcome the distaste with which he is viewed by many in the GOP. He'd even scored the support of establishment figures and convinced his rival, John Kasich to clear the field in the state. For years Cruz has argued that his absolutist strain of conservatism would win if only given a chance, and for months he has promised victory over Trump in a head-to-head match-up. Both of those hypotheses will be tested to and likely to be proven false. For Cruz, it will be a crumbling of the myth he helped create-of a silent crop of millions of conservatives who have stayed home in recent elections just waiting for a savior like him to turn them out to the polls. For Trump, a win won't put him over the needed figure, but makes him almost certain to reach the majority of delegates before the convention in July.
