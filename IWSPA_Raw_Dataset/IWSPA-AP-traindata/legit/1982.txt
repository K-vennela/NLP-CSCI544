Linda,
Thanks for getting back to me and sorry we missed each other this morning.
As I mentioned, the Barack Obama Foundation is putting together a dinner on
Thursday, May 5th to discuss the vision and goals of the Foundation.  Given
that you and Roger have been such great supporters of the President I
thought this might be something you would be interested in attending.
I have copied Jordan Kaplan on this email.  Jordan is the DNC Finance
Director but also helping set up the Foundation in his free time.  If you
and Roger have any questions or are looking for any additional information
on the Foundation he is the best person for you to connect with.  We hope
you will be able to join us!
