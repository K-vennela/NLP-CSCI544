THE BIG IDEA:=C2=A0Desperate times call for desperate measures.
If you had any doubt Ted Cruz was desperate, he proved it yesterday by anno=
uncing Carly Fiorina as his running mate three months before the Republican=
National Convention and six days before a win-or-die Indiana primary.
The gambit seems unlikely to change the trajectory of the race for 10 reaso=
ns:
1. It smacks of presumptuousness. It does not seem principled but political=
, which goes against the Texas senator=E2=80=99s brand.
2. It is hard to see the announcement dominating more than one news cycle. =
Cruz lost all five states that voted on Tuesday, finishing in third place b=
ehind Donald Trump and John Kasich in four of them. It was quite Trumpian o=
f him to change the subject with a bold stunt. Remember when Trump rolled o=
ut the Chris Christie endorsement the morning after his terrible debate per=
formance in Texas? But it feels inevitable that Trump will say or do someth=
ing today to upstage Cruz=E2=80=99s pick=E2=80=A6
3. How many Indiana Republicans are going to decide to vote for Cruz becaus=
e he tapped Fiorina? Not that many, we=E2=80=99d guess. =E2=80=9CFiorina do=

derate Republican voters: the suburban, upper-income folks who prefer pragm=
atism to bomb-throwing. And Fiorina is, at least rhetorically, a Cruz-style=
firebrand. There=E2=80=99s also the fact that pragmatic conservatives tend=
to favor someone for veep who has deep experience in governing and legisla=
ting, something that Fiorina does not.=E2=80=9D
Trump said on CNN last night=C2=A0that he believes Indiana Gov. Mike Pence =
will either endorse him or no one. The Fiorina=C2=A0rollout=C2=A0telegraphs=

Daniels, the former governor, both of whom would help.
Ronald Reagan and Richard Schweiker=C2=A0(AP Photo, File)
4. This trick has failed every time it has been tried.
In 1976, on the verge of losing the nomination to incumbent President Geral=
d Ford, Ronald Reagan announced Richard Schweiker as his running mate. It a=
ngered his core supporters, especially in the South, and did nothing to pee=
l away any delegates from the Pennsylvania senator=E2=80=99s delegation, wh=
ich was the goal. Schweiker became such a liability that he offered to drop=
out. Reagan kept him.
In 1952, Robert Taft told GOP insiders that he=E2=80=99d pick Douglas MacAr=
thur as his running mate if nominated over Dwight Eisenhower. Time Magazine=
recalls <<<link>>

adc304b9cf8c1C6ccd39fc>=C2=A0that this led many to say MacArthur should be =
the nominee.
In 1992, trying to woo African American voters, Jerry Brown said before the=
New York primary that he=E2=80=99d pick Jesse Jackson as his vice presiden=
t. But it hurt him badly with the state=E2=80=99s huge Jewish population, t=

nishing third, behind Paul Tsongas, in the Empire State.
5. Fiorina cannot deliver California. The only political contest Fiorina ha=
s ever actually won is a 2010 Republican primary in California. But after l=
osing to Barbara Boxer, she actually moved away from the state. I was in Ne=
w Hampshire last year when a voter told Fiorina how much she loves Californ=
ia. The then-candidate awkwardly responded that she now lives in Virginia a=
nd hinted pretty strongly that she doesn=E2=80=99t like the state all that =
much.
=E2=80=9CIn spite of her California ties, Fiorina does not bring deep conne=

6. Fiorina is not actually that talented as a surrogate. =E2=80=9CIn 2008, =
she botched her role as a McCain surrogate when she first said his vice pre=

7. Her dismal tenure as CEO at Hewlett Packard, which included a scandal ov=

8. It deprives Cruz of the chance to name a stronger running mate down the =
road. Someone like Marco Rubio might have actually helped Cruz carry a stat=
e like Florida in November.
9. Cruz has lost a valuable bargaining chip at a contested convention. He m=
ight have wanted to create some kind of unity ticket with Kasich, but that =
possibility is now foreclosed.
10. The mainstream media coverage this morning is pretty brutal and runs he=
