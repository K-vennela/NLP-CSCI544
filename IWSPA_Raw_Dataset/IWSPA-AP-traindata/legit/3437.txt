that sounds great - at least I am happy you are working on the sub fossil material still. I
have done some work comparing the Swedish and Finnish long series after standard RCS
detrending and there is good similarity at the century timescale for some considerable
periods - but significant differences over some others , even allowing for uncertainty in
the series  These are only 300 km separated so this is an interesting indication of changes
in continentality perhaps. I am also interested in extending the high-frequency density
series before 1400 AD , to show earlier volcanoes , even though the spatial coverage is
poor. It would be interesting to see your extreme year series - do you have a preprint of
your paper? I would really like to get support to continue a wider collaboration ,
including other northern long series to produce wide scale integrated series . What is the
latest state of your tree-line reconstruction , for periods earlier than you showed in the
Holocene paper? I am still hoping such support may come again from Europe.
very best wishes
Keith
