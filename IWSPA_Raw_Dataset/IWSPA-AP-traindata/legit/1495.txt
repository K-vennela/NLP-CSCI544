Ben,
All received and printed. The weather forecast for the next few days
is cold and windy, so I'll read this at the cottage in Coldstream.
Hope everything goes OK later next week. I will email comments, hopefully
on Nov 6, maybe Nov 7 if there is a lot of urgent things to do when I
get back.
Cheers
Phil
