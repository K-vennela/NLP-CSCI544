Phil,
sorry, first version of my message was a bit garbled. Here is the full 
message:
thanks for forwarding. It may be difficult for me to sue them over a 
footnote, and in fact he is very careful only to intimate accusations 
against me in a response to your comments. Note that he does not do so 
in the paper. I'm sure they know that I would sue them for that, and 
that I have a top lawyer already representing me.
Wei Chyung needs to sue them, or at the least threaten a lawsuit. If he 
doesn't, this will set a dangerous new precedent. I could put him in 
touch w/ anleading attorney who would do this pro bono. Of course, this 
has to be done quickly.  The threat of a lawsuit alone my prevent them 
from publishing this paper, so time is of the essence. Please feel free 
to mention this directly to Wei Chyung, in particular that I think he 
needs to pursue a legal course her  independent of whatever his 
university is doing. He cannot wait for Stony Brook to complete its 
internal investigations!  If he does so, it will be too late to stop this.
Gavin is in Shanghai, but perhaps may be able to provide some brief 
thoughts himself on this,
mike
