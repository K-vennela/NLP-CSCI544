St. 1st Class Herring,
Ok, thanks for the heads up on the carpool. I did not realize it was 250 miles out of teh way, I figured Minneapolis was on the way. Anyway, right now I should have a minivan full of local troops so it works out. Glad to hear Pvt. Waldon is going too. Don't you have another man that was suppossed to attend with you from there also, or not? 
Recruitment is not always easy, especially in the early stages of unit development, and also location can be a factor. Your chapter is very small right now, its hard to recruit with only one or 2 members and supporters with you, once that # increases to around 5 or 6 solid troops then watch how fast the new troops sign on. Location is a factor, you are in White North Dakota, Phoenix is a big City in a State Overrun by spics. Furthermore the PHX unit Leader is a veteran Leader who once led one of the largest National Alliance chapters back when Dr. Pierce was alive and the Alliance was going strong. They tell me he had 50 men under him at one time in AZ, and the new NSM unit there is growing very fast too. Recruitment is always easier in frontline battle areas, big Cities like Minneapolis are fertile, but out where I live it is not. Sure people here like the NSM, but its not bad enough for them to get serious and actually join up. 
To sum it up, don't get frustrated and never quit/give up, thats my advice. Our struggle is like a Boxing match, if you go into the match thinking you might lose, or with doubt in your mind, you are finished and will lose the match. A positive outlook on the fight will give you excitement and that positive energy can brush off on potential recruits who will want to be a part of your Victory. 88 Commander Schoep
