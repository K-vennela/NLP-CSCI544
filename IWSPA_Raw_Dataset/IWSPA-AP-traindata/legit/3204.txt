Steven, As a quick response…..for the key markets of AUST/NZ….that would enable us to catch the first week of school vacations (only a 2 week Spring holiday time)….and it now brings this September timing into play…it was not a consideration before. Hence why we were dated in late November. I will respond again by your Monday…. after further discussion with my teams.   Stephen Basil-Jones Executive Vice President - Aust./N.Z. & Northern AsiaSONY PICTURES RELEASING PTY LTDLevel 26, 1 Market St, Sydney NSW  2000 T: + 612 9272 2902 E: user@domain.com  From: ODell, Steven 
Let me know if you think your markets would want to move up if the US advances one week.  Ok to reach out to the key territories in confidence
