Dr. Jones,
I am contacting you on behalf of Dave Bader and Tim Barnett regarding a couple 
action items in support of early detection on climate change.  Based upon the 
anticipated award for NOAA support during fiscal year 1997 on climate change 
data and detection, DOE has authorized the Pacific Northwest National 
Laboratory (PNNL) to utilize existing funding through 9/30/96 to conduct a 
meeting of the experts, and to begin preliminary investigations.

support through 9/30/96.  In order to place a contract with you, I need to 
submit a statement of work and signed cost proposal to our Contracts 
Department.  If you could please fax this to me as soon as possible on (509)
