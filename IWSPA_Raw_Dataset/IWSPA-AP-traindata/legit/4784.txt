Andrew,
Getting a bit fed up with these baseless allegations.
You could point out several things to Martin.
1. Projections aren't made with observed data - instrumental or paleo. They are made with
climate models.
2. The initial seed for all these allegations is made on Climate Audit. Here they are
quite clever and don't go over the top. They leave it to others like the National Review,
the American Thinker to make the ridiculous ones.
Here is what Stephen McIntyre says on Climate Audit.
"While there is much to criticise in the handling of this data by the authors and the
journals, the results do not in any way show that 'AGW is a fraud' nor that this particular
study was a 'fraud'.
McIntyre has no interest in publishing his results in the peer-review literature. IPCC
won't be able to assess any of it unless he does.
You dad and Susan Solomon have had runs in with him and others
3. You might like to send him this pdf and its Figure 2.  Three different groups get much
the same result.
Here are the two web pages we have put up so far. Keith is working on the tree one and
put much more later in the week.

So other groups around the world have also entered into agreements. I know this doesn't
make it right, but it is the way of the world with both instrumental and paleo data. I
frequently try and get data from other people without success, sometimes from people who
send me the pdf of their paper then tell me they can't send me the series in their plots.

It is the right wing web sites doing all this, presumably in the build up to Copenhagen.
