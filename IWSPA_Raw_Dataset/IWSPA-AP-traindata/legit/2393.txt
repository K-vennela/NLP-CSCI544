Hillary Clinton has won the Maryland Democratic primary, according to the Associated Press.
The former secretary of state commanded 20-point leads over Bernie Sanders in recent polls, including a 57 percent-to-32 percent advantage over the Vermont senator.
While Clinton herself did not visit the state over the last week, her daughter Chelsea campaigned in Maryland's Washington, D.C., suburbs on Thursday, in addition to making a stop in suburban Baltimore.
Clinton scored the endorsements of a number of statewide and local officials in Maryland both past and present, including Sens. Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski, and the state's treasurer and comptroller.
Maryland awards its 95 pledged delegates on a proportional basis.
