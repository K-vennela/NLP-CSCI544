This is another pretty good article. It does have some
false data but it definitely forwards the true data as
well.
Your assignment is to read the article and send a
clear, concise letter to the editor at
user@domain.com
You can write what you want but I suggest that you
pick out one true datum and write about how much you
agree with it or pick out one false datum and prove
that it is wrong. If you need more info about
TeenScreen, click on

If your last name ends in J-N, put the link to the
TeenScreen petition in your letter -

And, as always, report compliance by email.
