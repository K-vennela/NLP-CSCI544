Dear all,
I think the scientific fraud committed by Douglass needs to
be exposed. His co-authors may be innocent bystanders, but
I doubt it.
In normal circumstances, what Douglass has done would cause
him to lose his job -- a parallel is the South Korean cloning
fraud case.
I have suggested that someone like Chris Mooney should be
told about this.
Tom.
