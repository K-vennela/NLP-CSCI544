Hi Tim - Decisions, decisions... thanks so much 
for taking the initiative. I think - for the 
reason you state, we should go for the one that 
includes the 20th century. We make clear that 
these are not reconstructed temp, but normalized 
anomalies - this keeps us out of some trouble. 
But, I think the main message is that we're 
looking at this issue from every angle. And, 
we're letting others see the issue from every 
angle. It adds punch.
this means that the MWP box needs to talk about 
the period around 1400 - can you make sure that's 
on Keith's radar screen. I believe that 
historians talk about the Medieval Period going 
to at least 1450, so what the heck...
I you can adjust the caption to work, and then 
send both it and the final fig to yvind, me and 
Eystein that would be good - make sure Keith is 
ok with it all first, too.
Thanks Tim! Best, Peck
