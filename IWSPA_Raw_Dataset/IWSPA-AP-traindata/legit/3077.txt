yes, only foster's not much for his but I've got notionals and salaries from empmails to load (which are getting old). Once I've done them then I'm happy to go home or if I can be bothered I have a PLS I need to finish testing and some auality checking of Stuart & Michael and maybe Sammi's (just so that I can put some coaching reports or negative quality) and some CI calcs I want to finish off.
I guess I'll just see how I go with wasting a lovely Sunday at work
