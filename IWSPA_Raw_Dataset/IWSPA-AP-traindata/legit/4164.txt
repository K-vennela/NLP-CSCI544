Phil,
Why is there so much missing data for the South Pole? The period Jan 75 thru
Dec 90 is all missing except Dec 81, July & Dec 85, Apr 87, Apr & Sept 88,
Apr 89. Also, from and including Aug 2003 is missing.
Also -- more seriously but correctable. The S Pole is just represented 
by a single
box at 87.5S (N Pole ditto I suspect). This screws up area averaging. It 
would be
better to put the S Pole value in ALL boxes at 87.5S.
I have had to do this in my code -- but you really should fix the 'raw' 
gridded data.
For area averages, the difference is between having the S Pole represent 
the whole
region south of 85S, and having (as now) it represent one 72nd of this 
region. It
is pretty obvious to me what is better.
This affects the impression of missing data too of course.
Tom.
