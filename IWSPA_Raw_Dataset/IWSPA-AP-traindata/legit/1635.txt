Whoaah...Please don't put words in my mouth Keith, especially such inflamatory word!
I was not attributing the entirety of  "spin" here (which is of a pretty massive scale) to
you! And I said I think such "spin", where it has occurred, is EITHER sloppy OR
disingenuous. You chose to assume I was talking about you in specific, and that I was
attributing the latter rather than the former. My actual words don't bear this out. In the
case of the Briffa & Osborn piece,  I actually tend to believe that sloppiness was the main
problem. In other cases of "spin" (e.g., the skeptics web pages of Daly and his ilk) it is
most clearly disingenousnous...I don't equate you with Daly and those folks by any stretch
of the imagination. Hopefully, you know that I respect you quite a bit as a scientist! But
in this case, I think you were sloppy. And the sloppiness had a real cost...
And as to whether or not your statements about IPCC are fair (I didn't use the word
"disservice"!), I'll leave that to each to decide. But personally, I think they were
unfair, because they opened up IPCC to criticism that is not merited by what is actually
said or shown in the iPCC report. Other IPCC authors who have contacted me feel the same
way, and perhaps there may be an official response on the part of IPCC authors. I don't
know.
But I agree that any further discussion ought to take place in the peer-reviewed
literature,
Mike
