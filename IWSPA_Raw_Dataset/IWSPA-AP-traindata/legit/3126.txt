ST. 1st Class Herring,
Yes, get some rest Brother! I had a great time at the event too, except for
being sick Friday night of course. Don't let that ulcer get worse, rest and
relax. You did look better Saturday night.
Ooooo, an ignorant Proffessor that does not know about the NSM, what an
idiot. Yes, by all means speak to the class. I think you would do a great
job at that, probably leave the Prof. with his mouth hanging open in
disbelief. That guy must live in a bubble to think their are no NS left in
America (lol)! Yes, that should be a fun time too, go for it! 88 Commander
