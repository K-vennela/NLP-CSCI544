We are pleased to announce the reformation of one of our longest standing
NSM chapters in the Nation (NSM Twin Cities). The former HQ unit of the NSM
in Minneapolis, Minnesota fell dormant for a short time after the move to
Detroit, the retirement of senior members in Minnesota, and several of the
former unit Leaders relocating from Minnesota to lead or assist NSM Chapters
in other parts of the Nation. Minneapolis/St. Paul has long been a well
established and strong NSM base since the early 1990's, and now that
tradition continue's with the revival of the Minneapolis/St. Paul NSM
chapter.
Former NSM members in the State of MN., along with the current active duty
members contact your unit Leader at: user@domain.com  If you are
located in Southern Minnesota contact your local chapter at:
