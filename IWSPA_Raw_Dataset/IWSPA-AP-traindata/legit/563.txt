Good Sunday morning. It's 85 days to Cleveland, 92 days to Philly, 198 days to election.
SUNDAY BEST - ABC's Jonathan Karl interviews Charles Koch, 80, in Wichita, Kansas, at the Koch Industries headquarters, for "This Week": JK: "When you look back over the years, over the last several cycles, hundreds of millions of dollars in electoral politics, what have you gotten for that? What's been the return on that investment? CK: "Well, I've gotten a lot of abuse out of it." ... 
JK: "Am I hearing you correctly, you think Bill Clinton was a better president than George W. Bush?" CK: "Well in some ways. In other ways, I mean he wasn't an exemplar. But as far as the growth of government, the increase in spending, it was much more under George Bush when the Republicans had it, on restrictive regulations. It was 2.5 times under Bush than it was under Clinton." ... 
JK: "You couldn't see yourself supporting Hillary Clinton, could you?" CK: "Well, ... we would have to believe her actions would be quite different than her rhetoric. Let me put it that way. But on some of the Republican candidates ... before we could support them, we'd have to believe their actions will be quite different than the rhetoric we've heard so far." Video  <<link>>
