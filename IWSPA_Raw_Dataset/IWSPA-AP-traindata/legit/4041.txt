Dear Keith,
I think we have to take this talking and questioning seriously. what we do is important and we have to allow for replication. when we were confronted with such requests concering the ERIK-simulations, we were initially  reluctant, but now we gove teh data to verybpody. Got us two critical comments in "science" but I think it was worth it.
Do you mind if I publish your response? Would be the prometheus weblog.
I could ask what is meant with "update" - I do know not what is meant; I had just quoted a request which I find in principle not unreasonable - and I am happy to hear that you in principle agree.
Regards,
Hans
