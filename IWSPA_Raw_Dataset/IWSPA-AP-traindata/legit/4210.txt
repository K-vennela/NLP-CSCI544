Since there are now going to be 4 people greeting him, I think it makes more sense to do the greet in the bar area rather than the hallway by the door he enters through. There's a bit more space and the lighting is better.
Do you want to check with Bobby to see if he's ok with that? Talking to the advance guy now and he's on board.
Thanks!
