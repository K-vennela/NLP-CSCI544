Jersey goes way over the line
The recent articles describing Gov. Jon S. Corzine's
signing into law a measure that requires New Jersey
health-care providers to screen women for postpartum
depression really disturbs me.
Psychiatric drugs are known to cause suicidal thoughts
and violence, that's why the FDA issued a black box
warning for them. It's bad enough that 8 million kids
are already on these drugs, but now pregnant mothers
should be?
This is definitely crossing way, way over the line!
Screening will prevent mothers from seeking other
solutions to their problems, like, nutrition,
hormones, etc. Why be put on drugs prescribed to treat
an unscientific "disorder" when there could be an
actual medical reason for the way a mother is feeling?
