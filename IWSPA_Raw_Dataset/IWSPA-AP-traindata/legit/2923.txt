Hello Jonathan, Keith, and Eystein:
I want to make a reminder about the embargo for release of the WRA Science comment article.  Please do not disseminate this article to anyone else, or discuss it publically until it is actually published, which I know Science wants to do soon.  I still believe citation is appropriate, and I have asked for clarification on this from the editors.  I will let you know what/if I hear from them.
FYI, this issue is also related to the NAS committee looking into last millenium surface temperature reconstructions this week, as I think you are aware.  Today, the NAS staff person working with this committee said he talked to Jesse Smith of Science about this article, who mentioned he could say nothing, but referred the staff person to me.  I was not really sure what this meant, and so I did not say anything specific on this myself, to ensure that I would not be in conflict with the embargo.  That is where it stands in that arena for now.
As you saw in the message from Steve Schneider that I copied to you, however, there is no embargo of any kind on use of the Climatic Change article.
Peace, Gene
