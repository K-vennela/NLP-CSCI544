honestly just a cross thread between Tom and I.  I had been asked by 
Darrell whether we should use the Sidorova chronology - because of 
hassle by you know who - so asked Tom a while ago to ask you. I did 
not see your answer - sorry if you cc'd me in as I have not been 
checking emails. I fully accept and would NEVER go behind your back 
to ask for the data. I understood that the chronology was published 
and so thought to compare our RCS version with it if we could produce 
it in time . We are being accused of not using that chronology in the 
Science paper- so then asked Anders for it. I am happy to send 
Darrell the single chronology if that is what Anders has sent. I am 
having to start thinking about the Yamal crap and then this Darrell 
stuff suddenly arises. I just wanted him to consider including the 
Polar Urals reconstruction and the Sidorova series in his analysis 
before publishing a correction in Science- apparently the selection 
criterion for inclusion of series was anything published north of 60 
degrees and longer than 1000 years. I could do without all this now - 
don't really understand what Climate Audit are getting so hysterical 
about but feel that I can not ignore it this time - but don't feel up 
to getting involved. I fully admit to being out of the loop as 
regards all this and having trouble getting back to it.
To restate - this was a confusion. I fully accept your point (as you 
know I would). Sorry if you thought I was doing anything without your 
knowledge - TO BE HONEST ALSO - I actually was not really  aware that 
the data you were producing and that used by Sidorova were one and 
the same. Best wishes hopefully all ok
I assume that we are allowed to use the chronolgy as published - are 
we? I have not contacted Sidorova. Can you cc answer to Tom as I have 
no email at present. (this coming from someone elses computer)
