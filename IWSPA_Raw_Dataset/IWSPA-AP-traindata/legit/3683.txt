Morning Martin,
It might be worth taking Keith's advice and contacting Malcolm Hughes.
I am not convinced that the Bunn study is fully relevant to addressing the use of BP data
from Colorado and California as their study site is Montana. Malcolm gave a presentation
earlier this year in Edinburgh which presented updated analyses on his BP work which played
down the CO2 influence.
regards
Rob
