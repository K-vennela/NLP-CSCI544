#1:
Respond to this cookie-cutter letter by TeenScreen's
Leslie MacGuire, trying desperately to defend the
fraudulent activities and goals of TeenScreen:
<<link>>
(TEXT AT BOTTOM)
Write whatever you want except if your last name ends
in D-J or S-T. Then I want you to include the
TeenScreen petition link and write something like "how
can Leslie MacGuire ignore the public outcry" or "your
newspaper should investigate a little what's really
going on".
Some of the rest of you might also want to point out
that Ms. MacGuire letter is not "reader opinion", it's
free advertisement for her employer.
Send your letter to user@domain.com. You have to
include your full name, address and a daytime phone
number.

There is an interesting article in the Fond Du Lac
(Wisconsin) Reporter.
Read it at this link or read the text below:
<<link>>
There are a lot of ways you could attack this article.
I recommend any of the following general themes:
-Don't lump psychiatric disorders with true physical
illness. There is no certainty that even one child has
a mental "disease" because there is no objective test
for it.
-The disorders are made up by psychs and drug
companies to make a profit.
-You could also go a completely different way, if you
want, and point out that the "chronic illnesses" are
caused by poor nutrition, too much tv, toxins, etc.
-And here's my favorite! Point out that there isn't an
increase in illnesses, there is just an increase in
people labeled with illnesses, because the drug
companies have infiltrated the schools to find more
customers. Examine each and every one of the chronic
illnesses listed and you'll find that each on is
associated with a profitable, patented drug.
