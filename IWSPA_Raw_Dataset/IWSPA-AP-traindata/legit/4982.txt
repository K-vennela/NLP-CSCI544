Dear Ben and Renee:
Attached is a short form agreement draft. We believe it captures the economic points in our charts sent to you last week, and includes key protections Mark E requested. We were unable to use the entirety of your draft because, as we previously communicated, we believe that the parties are best served by streamlining/consolidating the too numerous prior agreements into a single new agreement which clearly sets forth the relationship and rights and obligations of the parties on a going forward basis.
Letâ€™s discuss after the two of you and Mark E have had a chance to review the draft agreement.
Sincerely, Len.
