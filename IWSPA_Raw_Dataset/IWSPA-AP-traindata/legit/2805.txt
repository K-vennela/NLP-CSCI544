Good Monday morning. AP reminds us that 55 years ago today, in a speech to the National Association of Broadcasters, FCC Chairman Newton N. Minow - a loyal Playbooker, now age 90 -- decried the majority of television programming as a "vast wasteland."
JOE SCARBOROUGH, on MSNBC's "Morning Joe": "How you doing, Donald? It's very funny when you say you don't watch the show. I think it's cute. Keep it up. It makes us feel good that you care that much that you tweet about us." <<link>>
JUST POSTED - "Trump's empty administration: As presumptive nominee takes first steps on transition, GOP policy veterans say they're not interested," by Darren Samuelsohn and Morning Money's Ben White: "Politico interviewed nearly five dozen Republicans over the past two weeks - people with experience working in government and who understand how Congress can enact, or shred, a new president's agenda - and heard the same sentiment expressed repeatedly. If Trump doesn't change his tune or extend much longer olive branches, many of these government veterans say they intend to cede highly coveted administration posts to less-experienced competitors. ... 
"The lack of interest in serving Trump extends from the energy and financial services sectors to defense and foreign policy. ... [T]he absence of experienced professionals at the assistant-secretary level could have profound consequences on the government. ... 'Trump will be able to fill these jobs because there is a whole class of people who want these titles so badly it doesn't matter who is president,' said a former senior George W. Bush administration official. 'But these are B- or C-level people. ... The A-level people, and there are not that many of them to begin with, mostly don't want to work for Trump." <<link>>
