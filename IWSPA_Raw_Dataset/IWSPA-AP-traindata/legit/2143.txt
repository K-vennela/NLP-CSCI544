Denied a permit, the National Socialist Movement plans to hold rally during
football game.

Sept. 9, 2008
Despite being denied a permit to hold a parade, a local neo-Nazi group sai=
d
it still intends to hold a rally in Columbia during an upcoming MU home
football game, but police said they are trying to reach an agreement with
the groupw.
In a letter addressed to Interim Columbia Police Chief Tom Dresner, the
mid-Missouri chapter of the National Socialist Movement stood firm on its
right to march in Columbia on Nov. 8.
The Columbia Police Department denied the group's request for a parade
permit last week because MU is scheduled to host a home football game
against Kansas State on that day. The department said in a news release tha=
t
the two events would overburden police resources on that date.
"We do intend to come on Nov. 8 with or without a permit," NSM national
director Jeff Schoep said in the letter. "It is our legal right, and we can
do a walking picket on city sidewalks according to law."
Schoep said the group would seek legal injunction against the City of
Columbia if the group was not allowed to march.
"If the NSM is forced back into the courts to challenge a violation of our
rights once again, I will free up every last dime we have at our disposal t=
o
hire the absolute best attorney we can find in the state of Missouri," he
said in the letter.
Schoep then cited instances when the group had taken legal action against
the cities of Orlando and Toledo, Ohio, and had earned a permit to march
after originally being denied one.
Representatives from the NSM met with CPD on Monday as part of an appeal t=
o
the denial of their request.
According to a statement released by Dresner on Monday, discussions are
continuing between the NSM and the department, and Dresner said it would no=
t
comment on the issue until they are "recontacted by the NSM regarding their
intentions" and an agreement is reached between the two parties.
Lt. Charles Wilson, leader of the NSM's stormtroopers division, estimated
that there were already 120 people who had booked plane tickets or were
planning to drive to the event on Nov. 8.
The group's goal with the march is to protest illegal immigration, Wilson
said. "We will be there," he said.
Schoep also attacked how the police department handled the denial. He
contested the validity of a football game as a reason to deny the permit an=
d
attacked the manner in which the group was informed of the denial.
"It has been noted that your department informed the press of the initial
denial of our permit," Schoep said in the letter. "Yet, we had not been
informed by your department if the permit was approved or denied. The media
informed us, so we assume that it may not even be true."
Schoep wrote that the letter was being sent by U.S. Postal Service on
Monday to the police department but was released to the media via e-mail
beforehand.
Despite the group's criticism with how the denial was handled, it said it
is still willing to compromise with the city.
"If you are willing to negotiate with us on the terms of the rally, and
time, we are open to amend within reason," Schoep said in the letter.
One change the group was willing to make, he said, would be to cut down th=
e
march from the original five hours it requested.
Dresner said the two sides were supposed to meet to discuss the matter on
Monday.

No Neo-nazi Fanfare
I know our cops reporter, Joe Meyer, has already posted on his blog that
the neo-Nazis, members of the National Socialist Movement, plan to march in
Columbia Nov. 8,<<<link>>
p>but
since I wrote the three stories last week, I wanted to share some
things
expressed to me.
I got some angry phone calls - some people were furious that the paper
printed the news on the front page, concerned about their kids reading it
and finding out what neo-Nazis were.
Many people said our city should simply ignore the group and its efforts an=
d
stage an alternative event to show opposition. Some said more needs to be
done, such as citizens taking action by signing up for membership with
organizations the neo-Nazis oppose, such as the Anti-Defamation League and
the NAACP.
I did get one call from a person who wanted to know where to get more
information about the group, which he is interested in possibly supporting.
As a journalist, I think the media must remain objective to fully serve our
readers, but I found an interesting approach while researching community's
responses to "hate" groups. I was reading about the effort of citizens in
Billings, Mont., to combat hate crimes occuring in their city. After one
incident in which Jewish people were attacked, the paper ran a full-page ad
of a menorah, which residents tore out and posted everywhere as a symbol of
unity.
Now, I realize this is different because marching is certainly not a crime
