WASHINGTON POST // JULIET EILPERIN
Barack Obama rose to prominence as a different kind of Democrat, an outside=
r who was not part of the establishment and who would chart a separate cour=
se. Eight years later, the president finds himself working hard to restore =
a party from which he was once eager to stand apart.
Obama has presided over a greater loss of electoral power for his party tha=

pportunity for him to reverse that trend.

Life's about learning, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young famously sang. And it=

The Democratic Senate race in Pennsylvania has tightened as the party's est=

polls had shown Katie McGinty, the establishment favorite, consistently tr=

leading him by 6 points, though a substantial number of voters remain undec=
