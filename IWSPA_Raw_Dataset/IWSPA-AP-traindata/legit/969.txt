You may be asking yourself "what's a TeenScreen
Sheboygan?". Well, Sheboygan is a very fine town on
Lake Michigan, about 30 miles north of Milwaukee. It's
an industrial town with something like 97.5%
hard-working, hearty Americans.
However, that last 2.5% is insidiously working to
enslave the rest with the TeenScreen program. The idea
is to ask invasive questions that could apply to any
normal teen, scream "aha!", slap a psych label on that
young person and count another life-long customer for
the psycho-pharmaceutical industry.
Are you going to stand by and let this happen?
Your assignment is to write a letter to the editor of
the Sheboygan Press.

you can, but it's the same old tired PR story.
