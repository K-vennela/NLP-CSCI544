Hi all,
The WLF is planning to host an afternoon reception during convention week.  This will not be a fundraiser but a sponsored event to thank our supporters and celebrate the work we've done as an organization.
I'm trying to plan this around other scheduled women's events that week.  Emerge, EMILY's List, and Politico's "Women Rule" group are all hosting events, so I'm considering a 2-4pm timeline on Tuesday, July 26th, which is currently "free."
Laila, can you let me know the details of the Women's Caucus meetings (days and times) if you know them?  I want to make sure this reception doesn't conflict.
Kate, we would obviously love for the Chair to attend so let me know if this is bad timing on your end or if you know of other conflicting events.
I'm hoping to find a sponsor/partner for the event (ELLE, Glamour, All In Together, etc.) so would also love to have your help in reaching out.  I'll also be working on confirming surrogates and candidates to attend so may ask for your support there too.
Please let me know if you have any questions or red flags.  Hoping we can pull this together!  Thanks in advance.
Claire
