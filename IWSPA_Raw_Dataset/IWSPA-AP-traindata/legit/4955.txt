Geoff,
Clare is off to Chelsea - back late tomorrow. We (Clare, Tim and me)
have had a brief meeting. Here are some thoughts and questions we had.
1. Were we going to do two sets of costings?
2. Those involved in UKCIP08 (both doing the work and involved in the SG) have
signed confidentiality texts with DEFRA. Not sure how these affect access to
the headline messages in the drafts we're going to be looking at over the next few
months.  Also not sure how these will affect the UKCIP workshops that are coming
up before the launch.
3. We then thought about costs for the CRU work. We decided on 25K for all
CRU work. At 500 per day this comes to 50 days. We then split this into
the tasks:  5 - 5 days, 6 - 5 days, 7 - 30 days, 10/11 - 5 days, which leaves 5
more days for meetings. Assumed the 25K was without travel to the meetings.
4. On CVs and pen portraits. Clare will send one before she leaves. Are what you
have for Tim and me OK?
5. Some thoughts on Tasks 6 and 7
Task 6 - assumed this was mostly Newcastle. Tim's work on rainfall extremes could be
fed in, and we can do something on non-rainfall variables. Assume also you expect us to
do waves, but not sure what we can do. It seems as though sea level has become waves?
Task 7 - assumed here Newcastle (Chris/Hayley) would be doing something on
blocking (large-scale variability). Oxford would do the final bit on conceptual
representation
of emissions and climate system and sensitivities, so based on GCMs.
This leaves CRU for the other three, which we base mainly on the 11 RCM runs,
which we can access through LINK. We could also use ENSEMBLES runs for the others,
but these would be RCMs. They seem more relevant for the sorts of scales UKCOP08
is working at.
All just a few thoughts at this time.
Can you send the UKWIR bid that went off, so we have a copy?
Cheers
Phil
