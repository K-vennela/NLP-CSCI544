Hi Tim,
yes, we processed our own RCS chronology using Jan's Jaemtland data.
I also agree that using Jaemtland or not would make little difference to the results.
Rosanne is presenting at this NAS meeting on Thursday which McIntyre is obviously going to
use as a forum to muddy the waters even further. He has given us a hard time about the use
of Gaspe and the Polar Urals chronologies and their influence on the 'hockey stick' trend
over the past 2 centuries. However, removing these series makes little difference to our
results in the past few centuries.
am just going through your e-mails w.r.t. the coral paper - it is a huge help
thanks
Rob
