Bill,
Glad to hear you are feeling better Brother, and that the Family is doing
well.
I am not sure where in the NSM you see this rot, if you see something I am
missing let me know. I purge the weak links when I find them if they are
serious problems. I do not underestimate you Comrade, I think you are a good
man. In fact we would not have even considered you for the SS had we thought
any different.
My detractors call me a scumbag and a Movement Con-man and other
dishonorable nigger-like things. I served this Movement before some of them
even knew what the Movement was, and I can bet I have taken more abuse for
the cause than the whole lot of them thrown together. Any direct questions
or concerns you have, just go ahead and ask, call me if you'd like. I don't
let the internet rumours bother me, if it were true I would be worried, but
most of what is said is bs, and I am used to the backstabbing that has held
back the WP Movement for decades, you get thick skin after awhile in this
fight.
If you truely believe what the detractors are saying, there is nothing I can
say to convince you otherwise. Facts are facts, and I should not have to
convince fellow NS that we are on the right path, it should be felt and
known. However, like I said I am willing to answer any specific questions
you might have, in the interest of putting your concerns aside. I am
surprised to hear you are letting these losers get inside your head and
cause you concern, we have so much work to do. 88
