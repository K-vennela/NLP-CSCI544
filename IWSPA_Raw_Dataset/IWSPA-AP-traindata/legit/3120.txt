Awwwwww, the anti-racist scum from the Anti-racist action plan to rally
against us in Milwaukee at the NSM Town Hall Forum on November 10th. If its
anything like Madison we will see homosexuals in pink bunny suits, and the
usual unwashed mob of drugged out communists, and other filth screaming at
us like mental patients. Here is the release from the Communits Party and
ARA affiliates:

Update
MKE to RNC has decided to get rid of its voucher system in favor of a "don't
be dumb" policy. Our security team will try to remain relatively aware of
the situation and act when problems arise at ours or participant request.
This was decided to be changed in an effort to be more inviting to
interested individuals who might be alienated by a vouching system. We
apologize for the confusion and last minute changes.
"Don't be dumb" Policy Suggestions:
-No cameras or taking of pictures of attendees without the consent of
individuals being photographed (this applies to all recording devices)
-Don't talk about anything specifically illegal
-Respect other people's space and don't perpetuate non-consensual behavior
*Ah Hell No, The NSM is Coming Town *
*It was recently found out that the National Socialist Movement will be
holding a "public meeting" on Saturday November 10th in a suburb of
Milwaukee. MKEtoRNC has decided to cancel several of our workshops so that
we can counter these fascists while planning to counter the RNC. This action
will allow us real world practice in the subjects of direct action and a
diversity of tactics, and remind us that we must constantly counter threats
to freedom and not just plan for a big showdown on September 1, 2008.*
So come one come all out for an amazing weekend of fun, action and strategy.
Together we will make sure their world ends and ours begins.
