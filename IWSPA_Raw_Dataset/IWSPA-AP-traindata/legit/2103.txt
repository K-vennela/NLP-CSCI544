Sounds like a good plan, perhaps your bus can bring you into Hutchinson, MN=
. Motels are cheaper out here (if the bus ticket price is the same, I am no=
t sure), and I could pick you up Friday Morning. Yes I do plan to leave Fri=
day late Morning and return Sunday. I am not sure if anyone else is going w=
ith me from here yet. Sgt. O'Conner our local unit Leader is having back su=
rgery so he won't be doing much, he is calling the other guys for me to see=
who can go, and Larry has some sort of cancer, so my crew here has some si=
ck and messed up guys, perhaps some of the younger pups can get off work, w=
e will see. I will go alone, or with just you and I if thats all we can mus=
ter. It should be an awesome event, am looking forward to it. If its just u=
s 2, we might as well take my car, if a couple more guys come, we will rent=
one. My car does not seat more than 2 adults. Here is my cell # 320-583-23=

I agree, bringing Ian would be a bad plan, just tell your woman that she wi=
ll have to sit a few events out, until the little warrior grows a bit (lol)=
, and that you will give her a full report when you get back so she doesn't=
miss much (ha ha). 88! Commander Schoep  p.s. Looking forward to traveling=
with you! Driving alone or taking a bus is so f*cking boring.=20
