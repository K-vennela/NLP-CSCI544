Philip,
I'm not unhappy at all. If I am it is more about HadCRUT2 and 3.
I read through the report to DEFRA and will be sending some comments later
today. I also commented on what Harry has written as a report for you. I've
left those comments with him as he's away this week and I'm off April 6-15.
It is a bit odd with HadCRUT2 that the problem has surfaced now and my
old mask hasn't made any difference.
Cheers
Phil
