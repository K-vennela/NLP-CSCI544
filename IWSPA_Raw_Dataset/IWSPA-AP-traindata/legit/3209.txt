Wibjorn,
I'm in Athens at the moment. Unless you're
referring specifically to the Arctic the temperature
curves in IPCC Ch 3 all include the oceans.
Fennoscandia is just a small part of the NH. When I'm
back next week, I'll be able to calculate the boxes that
encompass Fennoscandia, so you can compare with this
region. As you're aware Anders did lots of the update
work in 2001-2002 and he included all the NORDKLIM
data. I can send you a list of the Fennoscandian
data if you want - either the sites used or their data
as well.
I guess you're attachments are in your direct email,
which I come to later.
One final thing - we are getting SST data in from some
of the new sea-ice free parts of the Arctic. We are not
using these as we've yet to figure out how to as
we don't have normals for these 'mostly covered by sea ice
in the 1961-90' areas.
Cheers
Phil
