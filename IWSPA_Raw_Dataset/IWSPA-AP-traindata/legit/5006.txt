I agree.
pg 4 - doesn't even give us a good trailer moment.  I imagined it would be a funny father/daughter moment of Drac needing to be "mom" and being uncomfortable yet sweet or this would be where Mavis talked about her aspirations to be a writer.
pg - 10 Not sure the new lines do anything except reinforce the idea that Drac only wants the baby to be a vampire.    No context for what his fears might be -- that they may someday need to leave the hotel
pg 26 - Idea was for Mavis to be fun and even "monstery" like the old fun-loving Mavis but optimism isn't saying much 
pg 34 - Instead of bringing Mavis into the scene from the beginning and making it more like old buffet moment it is now even more over-written
To be honest, I liked the idea of an escalation in the first act and having something turn at the wolf pup party and have Mavis actually state her intentions -- it puts clear pressure on Drac for the second act because the stakes are them moving away.  It also feels like it gives Mavis more of a point of view.  I don't think this is yet right, but I'm worried that although the old buffet scene was better written and feels more clever, especially on Drac's part, that she isn't particularly strong.
pg 50 -  we need a few more  "populating the world" bits earlier on the road
pg 77 - definitely needs finessing
