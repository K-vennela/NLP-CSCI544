Ben,
I have attached the tropical mean trend profiles, now for the period 
1979-1999.
RAOBCORE  versions show much more upper tropospheric heating for this 
period, RICH shows slightly more heating.
Note also stronger cooling of unadjusted radiosondes in stratospheric 
layers compared to 1999-2004.
Just for information I have included also zonal mean trend plots for the
unadjusted radiosondes (tm), RAOBCORE v1.4 (tmcorr) and RICH (rgmra)
I do not suggest that these plots should be included but some of you 
maybe want to know about the spatial coherence
of the zonal mean trends. It is interesting to see the lower 
tropospheric warming minimum in the tropics in all three plots,
which I cannot explain. I believe it is spurious but it is remarkably 
robust against my adjustment efforts.
Meridional resolution is 10 degrees.
As you can imagine, the tropical upper tropospheric heating maximum at 
5S and the cooling in the unadjusted radiosondes at 5N are
based on very few long records  in these belts. 2-3 in 5S, about 5 in 5N.
Best regards and I wish you all a happy new year.
Leo
