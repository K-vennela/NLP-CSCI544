Dear Phil,
I was very sorry to hear of Hannah's health problems. I hope she makes a 
speedy recovery. Please give her my best wishes, and tell her that there 
is life and love after divorce!
My Mom's cataract surgery did not go very well, and it looks like she 
won't be able to drive any longer. Nick and I are best placed to take 
care of her, so I'm trying to persuade her to move to California. So 
there could be some big changes in our lives in 2008.
Nick has turned into a fine young man. It's going to be tough to see him 
leave for college in three and a half years.
I share your frustration about having to devote valuable time to the 
rebuttal of crappy papers. Douglass et al. is truly awful. It should 
never have been published. Any residual respect I might have had for 
John Christy has now vanished. I can't believe that he's a coauthor on 
this garbage.
Best wishes to all of you from rainy Livermore,
Ben
