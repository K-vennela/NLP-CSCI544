I think the problem is the same one as in 1988 and 1994. In order to answer the
question: "what is IPCC's best estimate of climate change over the next hundred
years, and the uncertainties?" we need a single best estimate of emissions (plus
a range of uncertainty). In the same way as modellres say "here is our best
estimate of climate sensitivity plus a range" then the SRES group should do the
same thing. Of course they can make all the usual disclaimers and talk about
surprises just as the climate modellers do. But NOT to come up with an estimate
for a Business as Usual emissions scenario (plus a range, of 6GtC to 30GtC at
2100) seems to be ducking responsibilities. "Getting away from single number
answers" is very laudable scientifically, but it presents policymakers (for
whome the whole IPCC exercise is undertaken) with a problem. As long as there is
a central estimate and a range, the surely both communities could be happy, as
they ultimately were with BaU in 1990 and IS92a in 1995?
