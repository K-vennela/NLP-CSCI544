According to the NSM website, the organization's core beliefs include
defending the rights of white people, preserving European culture and
reforming illegal immigration policies. The website also states that members
believe America was founded by and for white people, all people are not
created equal and the white race is in danger of dying out.

In a statement posted on the NSM website, Jeff Schoep condemns the use of

all," said Janice Rogers with GPD. "We will remain unbiased and protect all
parties that come to this city and protest or have some type of meeting."
