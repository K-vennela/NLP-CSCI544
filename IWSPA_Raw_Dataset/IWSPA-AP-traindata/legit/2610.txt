Phil,
I've seen this junk already. Look at the co-authors! DeFrietas, Bob 
Carter: a couple of frauds. I dont' think anyone will take this seriously...
Do you have any advance knowledge you could pass along that would help 
us gear up to do something on RealClimate?  I assume that there will be 
no surprises in the paleoclimate chapter, but I haven't seen the final 
draft. Any hints you can drop would be great...
thanks,
mike
