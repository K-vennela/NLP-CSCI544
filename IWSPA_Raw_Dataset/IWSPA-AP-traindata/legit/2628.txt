U.S. Strike on Taliban Leader Is Seen as a Message to Pakistan<<<link>>

NEW YORK TIMES // MARK LANDLER AND MATTHEW ROSENBERG
Early on Saturday, a middle-aged Pashtun man used forged documents to cross=
from Iran into Pakistan. A few hours later, on a lonely stretch of highway=
, he was incinerated by an American drone. It is not exactly clear how the =
Americans tracked Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, leader of the Afghan Tali=
ban, to a white sedan rattling across the arid expanse of Baluchistan Provi=
nce. The United States picked up a mix of phone intercepts and tips from so=
urces, American and European officials said, and there were reports that Pa=
kistan also provided intelligence. President Obama described Mullah Mansour=
's death on Monday as an "important milestone" - but the strike was also an=
illustration of the tangled relationship between Washington and Islamabad.=
Not since Mr. Obama ordered Navy SEALs to hunt down Osama bin Laden in May=
2011 has he authorized a military incursion in Pakistan as audacious as th=
is one. The White House did not inform the Pakistanis in advance of the ope=
ration, which occurred outside the frontier region near Afghanistan, the on=
e place where Pakistan has tolerated American drone strikes in the past. By=
using the military's Joint Special Operations Command rather than the C.I.=
