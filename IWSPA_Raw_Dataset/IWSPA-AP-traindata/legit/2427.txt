Perfect.  That's what I needed to know.  I'm currently juggling the idea of=
attending a military academy or else a typical trade school/university, so=
I will try to help out as much as I can, though extremely devout behavior =
towards the cause is not an option at the moment.  I will continue to preac=
h the word, however, and wish you guys the best of luck in the March on Was=
hington.
Make us proud, serving the front line.
