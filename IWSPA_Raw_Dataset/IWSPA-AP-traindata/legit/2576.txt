Hi Phil et al,
Re, Malcolm co-authorship--big oversight on my part. Can you ask Ellen if we can add his
name (i.e., just say it was 'accidentally left off'), where it belongs alphabetically in
the list.
I've talked to Malcolm on the phone. The PC #1 *is* the right one--but Malcolm has raised
the valid point that we need to cover our behinds on what was done here, lest we be
vulnerable to the snipings of the Idsos and co (i.e., that non-climatic influences on
recent growth were nominally dealt w/, as in MBH99).
Malcolm is supposed to be sending some text to Phil.
So, can we incorporate his small bit of text, and add his name, and then resubmit to AGU
ASAP?
Thanks all for all the help here. Now, I better get back to my newlywed wife!
