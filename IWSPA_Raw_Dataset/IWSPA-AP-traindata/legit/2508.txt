Hello Ben and Colleagues,
I've been following these exchanges with interest.  One particular point 
in your message below is a little puzzling to me.  That's the issue of 
trying to avoid circularity in the culling of models for any given D&A 
study. 
Two potential problems occur to me.  One is that choosing models on the 
basis of their fidelity to observed regional and short term variability 
may not be completely orthogonal to choosing based on long-term trend.  
That's because those smaller scale changes may contribute to the trends 
and their patterns.  Second, choosing a different set of models for one 
variable (temperature) than for another (humidity) seems highly 
problematic.  If we are interested in projections of other variables, 
e.g. storm tracks or cloud cover, for which D&A has not been done, which 
group of models would we then deem to be most credible?  I don't have a 
good alternative to propose, but, in light of these considerations, 
maybe one-model-one-vote doesn't appear so unreasonable after all.
With regards,
Dian
