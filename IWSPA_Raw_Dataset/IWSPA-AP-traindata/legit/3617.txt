NSM Radio/tv news: The NSM Radio and TV team sent one of our own Reporters into the anti-racist section (the anti's did not know he was one of us), and then later into the NSM Rally support section on the other side of the Highway. The first on-line video we have released is clips from a unique perspective, what the outside spectators see. 2 new video's linked up now for NSM/TV at www.nsm88radio.com  Not to be out-done NSM Radio has also posted new shows:
