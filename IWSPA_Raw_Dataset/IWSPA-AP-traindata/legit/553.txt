Phil,
will do. And regarding TSI, it looks like that 1361 or 1362 (+/-) are going to be the new
consensus. All I hear is that this seems to be quite robust. Fodder for the critics: all
these modelers, they always put in too much energy - no wonder it was warming - and now
they want to reduce the natural component? The SORCE meeting is going to be on that
satellite stuff but also about climate connections : Sun-Earth. Tom Crowley is going to be
there, Gavin Schmidt, David Rind, and a few others; of course Judith.
Thanks for Bo Vinther's manuscript!
