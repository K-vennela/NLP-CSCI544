An FDA advisory panel holds a much-watched vote on a muscular-dystrophy drug, and one expert argues that Medicaid expansion could help slow America's rising suicide rate. But first: Concerning state reports on ACA exchange enrollment.
1M-PLUS EXCHANGE CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE QUIT SINCE FEBRUARY - That's according to Jed Graham of Investor's Business Daily, who notes evidence of significant attrition on the exchanges. Why? Blame the shuttering of co-ops, among other factors. More from Graham: <<link>> 
DRUGMAKERS ARE SPENDING BIG TO FIGHT CALIF. PRICE CONTROL REFERENDUM - The biggest near-term threat to the drug industry? Not Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton's pledges to introduce Medicare price negotiation - but a California ballot initiative that would test a version of that idea in the nation's most populous state.
That ballot initiative "is a grenade being rolled into the conversation, and it is being taken very seriously," a Republican drug lobbyist in Washington, D.C, tells Pro's Nancy Cook and Sarah Karlin-Smith. More for Pros: <<link>>
30 PERCENT - That's the likelihood of Congress passing a proposal in the next four years to require manufacturers to pay a rebate on drugs covered through Medicare Part D for low-income beneficiaries, according to Morningstar health care analysts. The analysts also break down how other legislative proposals could affect the health care industry: <<link>>
GOOD MORNING, IT'S MONDAY PULSE - Where we're still wondering how Jon Snow will bounce back from ICD-10 code X99.1XXD. Tips (but no spoilers) to user@domain.com or @ddiamond on Twitter.
AN FDA PANEL TODAY WILL DECIDE THE FUTURE OF SAREPTA - An independent panel of experts will vote on whether the company's new muscular-dystrophy drug should be approved. The recommendations aren't binding - but the FDA normally goes along with its advisory panel's guidance.
Many patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and their families have pinned their hopes on the drug, eteplirsen, and it's seen as a make-or-break moment for Sarepta, too. However, FDA staff reviewers blasted data on the drug's effectiveness last week.
- What's Duchenne muscular dystrophy? The rare muscle-wasting condition affects about 20,000 boys in the United States every year, and it's devastating; most patients afflicted with it need a wheelchair by age 12 and die by their mid-30s.
- How patients are trying to sway regulators. Writing at Wonkblog, Carolyn Johnson examines how the fight over Sarepta is being shaped by grass-roots lobbying from families. <<link>>
- Watch the webcast. It's scheduled to run from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., with the panel expected to begin hearing grueling testimony from patients and families around 2:30 p.m. and begin voting on a series of questions around 4:30 p.m. Live stream here: <<link>>
- Expected to attend: Rick Santorum said he'll join advocates in a sign of support; Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker is sending his deputy chief of staff (Sarepta is located in Cambridge); and top FDA officials Janet Woodcock and Bob Temple are scheduled to present, which is an unusual move but a show of how the agency is viewing the meeting.
BERNIE SANDERS SPEAKS OUT ON CIGARETTES - Sanders last week disagreed with Hillary Clinton on soda taxes - saying they hurt the poor - but he suggested on Sunday that cigarette taxes don't go far enough.
"Cigarettes are causing cancer, obviously, and a dozen other diseases," Sanders said on "Meet the Press" yesterday. "And there is almost the question as to why it remains a legal product in this country." 
- And if he loses the nomination to Clinton? On multiple shows, Sanders was pressed on what he would ask Clinton to focus on, if she's the Democratic nominee. "A program that makes health care for all in this country a right within the next several years," was part of his response.
- But Bernie's single-payer quest may not be over. "Sanders should be in a position to do something about this next year, even if he is not president," Jonathan Cohn writes. "He'd be occupying one of the safest seats in Congress and, for the first time in his career, he would have the visibility and support to seriously influence the congressional agenda." 
That doesn't mean Sanders would get "Medicare for all" enacted, but he could be in a position to fill in holes in the Affordable Care Act, or create building blocks for universal coverage. More from Cohn: <<link>> 
COULD MEDICAID EXPANSION HELP STOP RISING SUICIDE RATES? - University of Chicago professor Harold Pollack thinks so, and he argues that last week's CDC report on the rising U.S. suicide rate is another reason the remaining 19 holdout states should expand.
"There is good reason to believe that these ungenerous states are harming people's mental health," Pollack writes, citing evidence from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment on how expanding Medicaid coverage appeared to improve personal finances and lower mental distress. <<link>>

PRINCE'S DEATH COULD SPARK OPIOID CONVERSATION - We won't know the results of Prince's autopsy for a few weeks, and we don't want to make too much of a TMZ report Friday that the rock star might have overdosed a few days before his death on painkillers - presumably prescribed for his chronic hip pain. 
But if opioids did play some role, expect Prince to become the high-profile face of the growing epidemic, amid the debate over how state and federal policies can curb overprescribing and a partisan fight on the Hill over resources and funding to combat and treat addiction.
- Blaming the victims? Nearly 40 percent of Americans blame opioid users for the nation's opioid crisis, according to a recent Harvard School of Public Health/Stat News poll. Almost as many blame doctors. 
'60 MINUTES' LOOKS AT OHIO's HEROIN EPIDEMIC - The state's struggling to cope with a spreading problem, and lawmakers are trying to strike a balance between prosecution and rehabilitation, according to a "60 Minutes" feature aired on Sunday night. "We're not going to arrest our way out of this problem," said Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine. More: <<link>> 
- Heroin kills at least 23 Ohioans per week. "60 Minutes" also cited a recent University of Cincinnati study that found one in five Ohio residents knew someone who is struggling with heroin.

CAN THERANOS SURVIVE? - The New York Times has a story this morning on whether the embattled blood-testing company has a future. Theranos has been dogged by scrutiny since the Wall Street Journal first raised questions about the tests' quality and accuracy last year.
The consensus among experts is bleak, but if the technology works, "I don't think they're beyond salvage, beyond redemption," said industry consultant Lakshman Ramamurthy. More: <<link>>
- Unhappy with the Times story: The reporter who's led WSJ's Theranos investigation. The Times "erred calling my coverage 'scathing,'" the WSJ's John Carreyrou tweeted. "It should've said 'accurate,' 'life-saving,' or 'a public service.'"
HARVARD's $21 MILLION COMMITMENT TO HAPPINESS - China's Lee Kum Ke family officially announced a $21 million-plus gift to establish a new center for health and happiness at Harvard's School for Public Health. (Which probably boosted the happiness of a few people at Harvard.)
The center's goal: To uncover evidence on how personal behaviors, health care and a wide range of policies can influence happiness. More: <<link>>
