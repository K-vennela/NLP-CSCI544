Commander Jeff Schoep of the National Socialist Movement of the United
States
The National Socialist
Movement<<<link>>(United_States)>is,
according to its website, the largest and most active Nazi party in
the United
States <<<link>>>. Accordingly, it refers
to itself as 'America's Nazi Party' and aims to instigate major change in
the US.
*Wikinews* was able to conduct an interview with the head of the party,
Commander Jeff Schoep. Fresh back from a march in
Missouri<<<link>>>,
Commander Schoep told *Wikinews* his views on Barack
Obama<<<link>>>,
the economy and much more.

*Does your party believe America will be a better or worse place with Obama
as President?*
- *Commander Schoep:* Here is my answer to this: Why Obama is Good for
Our Movement<<<link>>>

- *Commander Schoep:* Obongo is just another figurehead. He answers to
International jewry just like McCain, it does not matter what color his skin
is, he is more of the same old same old system that has crippled our Nation.

*Obama says he wants to close Guantanamo
Bay<<<link>>>- what are your views
on this?
*
- *Commander Schoep:* Our Position on Guantanamo is that it is a National
disgrace and should be shut down completely. The Prison was set up to
torture and avoid U.S. laws of fair treatment of prisoners, it should be
closed. Furthermore many Soldiers (P.O.W.'s) are being held there in
violation of International P.O.W. laws, instead these soldiers are
classified as enemy combatants or terrorists. For example the
Taliban<<<link>>>was the legitimate
Government in
Afghanistan <<<link>>>, yet their soldiers
are not classified as soldiers. It is a violation of the rules of warfare,
and it is criminal. For those reasons the Prison should be closed and the
soldiers returned to their homelands.

*There are fears Obama may be assassinated. What do you think that would
mean for America and for your party?*
- Commander Schoep declined to answer this question.

An entrance to a camp at Guantanamo Bay. Schoep and Obama both want to see
the facility closed down

*Why do you think Obama succeeded over
McCain<<<link>>>
?*
- *Commander Schoep:* McCain is an out of touch fool who openly crusaded
for his beloved 3rd World invaders, who did not vote for him anyways because
he is white. The Republicans lost many votes not just due to McCain's lack
of charisma, but mainly because the common man is sick of the Republican
lies and same old dog and pony show that was King George
Bush<<<link>>>.
Voters see McCain as an extension of the policies that got us into the
current economic mess/hardship in our Nation. Obama came across to the
masses as someone who would change things. Whereas the voters believe he
will change things and make America prosperous once again, I think his idea
of change will likely be similar to the change Kwame
Kilpatrick<<<link>>>did for
Detroit <<<link>>>, Marion
Barry<<<link>>>did for DC, and Robert
Mugabe <<<link>>> did for
Zimbabwe<<<link>>>.
Time will tell if he rules the land honestly, or if he attempts to further
corrupt it, perhaps installing a communist like agenda to uplift the ghetto
into the Suburbs. We will see...

*If you were in power, how would you deal with the current financial
situation?*
- *Commander Schoep:* We would institute a National Socialist Government.
We would cut all foreign aid to Israel<<<link>>>,
and other unneeded foreign aid. Institute an America First Policy, pull back
our troops from oversea's Zionist organized wars, and put them on America's
borders to defend against illegal aliens. Halt the 3rd World invasion that
is crippling our economy. We would abolish the Federal
Reserve<<<link>>>,
and ban foreign influence from all aspects of our economy, and seats of
Government.

<<<link>>:Palomares_H-Bomb_Incident.jpg&filetimestamp=20070826104705>
This nuclear bomb had to be recovered after it was lost into the sea after a
mid-air collision. Commander Schoep would like to see global nuclear
disarmament to prevent situations like this or misuse of such weapons.

*Do you feel responses so far, both in the US and internationally, by
politicians to the financial crisis were adequate, or could more have been
done?*
- *Commander Schoep:* More should be done, see above response. Most
American Politicians are afraid to take an America first stand, and bow down
to the Israelis instead. U.S. politicians need to throw off the shackles,
and stand up for the common man NOW, before its to late. Only through an
America First Policy will we regain prosperity and refuel our economy.

*Do you think the economy will be sorted out in, say, four years time?*
- *Commander Schoep:* No, I think it will worsen. The Communist
Party<<<link>>>openly endorses
and supports the new President, if that is a sign of things
to come, look out White America. The Winds of Revolution may already be
blowing.
<<<link>>:Wikinews_waves_Left.png&filetimestamp=20060515220834>
*WN*<<<link>>:Wikinews_waves_Right.png&filetimestamp=20060515220817>
*Is there need for some international financial co-operation, or could
America solve its own financial problems entirely on its own?*
- *Commander Schoep:* This would be an easy fix, bring all of our troops
home from Overseas, cut off all Foreign aid (starting with Israel),
institute an America First Policy across the boards, abolish the Federal
Reserve, and remove all Foreign Nationals from any Govn't or banking
institutions. That would be a start, and we should concentrate solely on our
own Nation.

*WN*<<<link>>:Wikinews_waves_Right.png&filetimestamp=20060515220817>
*The US currently owes a large amount of debt. How would you go about paying
this off and preventing the problem repeating itself?*
- *Commander Schoep:* Answer to this is above in the last question,
institute those solutions and revive our economy, then we can pay back our
debts.

Commander Schoep says the Tesla electric sports car is a good example of
efforts to move to greener alternative fuels
<<<link>>:Wikinews_waves_Left.png&filetimestamp=20060515220834>
*WN*<<<link>>:Wikinews_waves_Right.png&filetimestamp=20060515220817>
*Oil will eventually run out. That may or may not be short-term, but what is
clear is that the prices, although back down from the record highs, are set
to rise. Would you commit to using alternative sources of fuel and energy to
combat this, or have you another energy policy in mind?*
- *Commander Schoep:* We must look at alternative energy forms, many
valiant efforts are being made, such as the
Tesla<<<link>>>electric sports car
(can I get one of those for this endorsement, ha ha
kidding), and hybrid cars are a step in the right direction. I would favour
taking some of the Federal $$$ slated for Foreign Nations and wars to be
redirected at finding alternate and greener energy sources, and earmark
other funding for cancer research and programs to heal our own sick people
here in the U.S.

*WN*<<<link>>:Wikinews_waves_Right.png&filetimestamp=20060515220817>
*America recently revealed that they had lost a nuclear weapon off
Greenland<<<link>>>forty years ago. Many
others have gone missing. Do you think nuclear weapons
safety is adequate, does it need revamped, or should America commit to
nuclear disarmament?*
- *Commander Schoep:* This is a tricky question, I think nuclear weapons
are a bad thing, especially in the wrong hands, we know the Zionist terror
State of Israel has nukes, and threatens the entire Middle
East<<<link>>>with those weapons. Due
to the Israelis having them, now
Iran <<<link>>> wants them, and they have every
right to pursue them for self defence against a hostile and unpredictable
neighbor. In a perfect World I would say yes, all Nations should disarm them
to insure that there are no accidents or madmen launching them at other
Nations. The harm to the environment and mass human life is way to great to
allow any Nuclear accidents. If there is a way to disarm all Nations nuclear
arsenals, then I am all for that, but until all Nations have disarmed and
destroyed them, others will keep trying to build them for their own National
integrety.

*What issues do you think the next US election will revolve around?*
- *Commander Schoep:* That remains to be seen. I am not a fortune teller,
so I will reserve my speculation for coffee table talks.
