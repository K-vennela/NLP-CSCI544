Dear all,
It could be viewed that using n-1 for 9 models where we used n-1 for five
models before is an implicit change in the stringency of our criterion.
When we had five models, agreement (0/5, 1/5, 4/5 or 5/5) could be expected
37% of the time just by chance (ignoring the near zero case).  With nine
models the equivalent figure for n-1 is only 3.5%, and it is still much
lower for n-2 (18%)... (assuming that my somewhat rusty probability
calculations are correct).  It really depends on what we had understood the
purpose of the criterion to be.  I am not certain how much this was
discussed.
Also, I would prefer Friday night as well if it means that more information
will be available.
Cheers
Peter
