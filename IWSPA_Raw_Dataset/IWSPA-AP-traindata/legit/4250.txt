Dear All,
I've knocked Chris off this reply. There is a meeting of the CCDD program next week
in Asheville. I guess Chris wants something for this. I'm on the panel, so if you want to
add to
what Gabi and Tom have put together then let me know and I'll feed that in additionally to
what is already there.
From being at the review last week of the vertical temperature trends panel, the
issue of
reducing forcing uncertainties is important. A number of people think that agreement in
the
20th century is all doing to model tuning due to uncertain forcing with sulphates. How to
counter this is one area. One of my own pet areas is trying to reduce uncertainties in the
paleo record for the last millennium, but again this is one of convincing people that we
really
know what has happened. So much is being made of the paleo records, but are they that
important to detection when most of the work is going on with the 20th century records. Is
the
pre-20th century really that important when it comes to D&A?
Cheers
Phil
