Lelia,
Well done on getting the truth out to the people who
really need it. TeenScreen had a good start in
Wisconsin in their plan to label and drug millions of
innocent children. If we get the truth out fast
enough, those children will be free to live without
fraudulent labels and dangerous drugs.
Forward this to all your friends. If anyone else wants
to write some letters, contact me -

Best regards,
Doyle
