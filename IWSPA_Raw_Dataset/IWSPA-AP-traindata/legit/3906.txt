Dear Peck et al
Thanks for clearing this up. The bottom line is that the version of this paper on the UCAR
site is fine. Unfortunately though, the one we have on the IPCC WG1 web site is not!
I am attaching a copy of that for clarity. The metadata in this PDF file indicate that it
was created by Oyvind Paasche from a Word document in early March when we were asking the
chapter teams to provide copies of the unpublished literature. It seems that Oyvind worked
from an earlier and significantly shorter version  - less text, fewer tables and the
figures are different - as you can see in the attached. Although to repeat my earlier
statement the conclusions of this earlier draft do not appear to me to be substantially
different.
Based on what we now know, the TSU should add the NCAR version of the paper to our review
web site and we will do that today.
Thanks
Martin
