Hi Keith and Eystein - good additions. Thanks. You can see how I edited them in the
attached. The only tought issue was Eystein's proposed key uncertaintly on ocean
circulation. I think it would be awkward to have multiple abrupt change uncertainties
listed (our list is already pretty long in general), so I combined your suggested bullet w/
the existing one (to include drought and other types of abrupt change:
"The mechanisms of abrupt climate change (for example, in ocean circulation and drought
frequency) are not well understood, nor are the key climate thresholds that, when crossed,
could trigger an acceleration in regional climate change."
If either of you thinks we can improve  further, pls track changes edit the attached.
Thanks again, Peck
