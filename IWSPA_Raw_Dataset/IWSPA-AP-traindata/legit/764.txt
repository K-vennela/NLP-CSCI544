THE HILL // VICKI NEEDHAM
President Obama on Monday said Congress needs to pass a sweeping Asia-Pacif=
ic trade agreement to ensure the United States takes the reins of global tr=
ade in the region instead of China. The Obama administration is working clo=
sely with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to build support for the 12-nation Tran=
s-Pacific Partnership (TPP), arguing that delaying votes on the deal will m=
ake it harder to pass the agreement, the president said in a Washington Pos=
t op-ed. "The world has changed," Obama said. "The rules are changing with =
it," he said. "The United States, not countries like China, should write th=
em. Let's seize this opportunity, pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership and ma=
ke sure America isn't holding the bag, but holding the pen." He argued that=
the deal will grow the U.S. economy and strengthen national security. "But=
none of this will happen if the TPP doesn't become a reality," Obama said.=
"That's because the Asia-Pacific region will continue its economic integra=
tion, with or without the United States," he said.

LOS ANGELES TIMES // CHRISTINA BELLATONI
It was supposed to be a snoozer of a state party convention. Then the presi=
dential race came to California. And the events in Burlingame Friday throug=
h Sunday gave a little taste of what the next five weeks could be like on t=
he Republican side. It started Friday when Donald Trump attracted angry pro=
testers who forced him to traipse through a field to get into the conventio=
n site, then dismissed them during his brief speech to California Republica=
n activists. He declared the race was close to over. "I think it's going to=
come to an end very soon," Trump said. "And really, I'm speaking to the pe=
ople in this room, because there has to be unity in our party." Sen. Ted Cr=
uz went after Trump for donating to Democrats, and his new running mate Car=
ly Fiorina offered a feisty stump speech to delegates Saturday night, takin=
g sharp jabs at Trump and those who oppose Cruz.

This is the most populous state in the nation, but in presidential election=

WASHINGTON POST // PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA
Over the past six years, America's businesses have created more than 14 mil=
lion new jobs. To keep this progress going, we need to pursue every avenue =
of economic growth. Today, some of our greatest economic opportunities abro=
ad are in the Asia-Pacific region, which is on its way to becoming the most=
populous and lucrative market on the planet. Increasing trade in this area=
of the world would be a boon to American businesses and American workers, =
and it would give us a leg up on our economic competitors, including one we=
hear a lot about on the campaign trail these days: China. Of course, China=
's greatest economic opportunities also lie in its own neighborhood, which =
is why China is not wasting any time. As we speak, China is negotiating a t=
rade deal that would carve up some of the fastest-growing markets in the wo=

FOREIGN POLICY // JAMES JEFFERY
The sudden trip of Vice President Joe Biden to Iraq this weekend - his firs=
t to Baghdad since U.S. troops left in late 2011 - was rudely upstaged by t=
he storming of the Green Zone by angry protesters on Sunday, just after the=
veep had decamped to Erbil. But while the optics looked ugly, the trip - a=
nd focus on righting the ship in Iraq - has long been central to Biden. Sin=
ce the first days of the Obama White House, Biden has been the president's =
point man for what may be the administration's toughest portfolio. Presiden=
t Barack Obama ran on a "get out of Iraq" ticket in 2007, although he tried=
after a fashion three years later to keep some forces on, and now has orde=
red 5,000 back to support operations against the Islamic State. In all of t=

rgy, his family relationship to Iraq (where his son served), his vote for t=
he invasion in 2002, and his close focus on events there as Senate Foreign =
Relations chair. But this long history is not without controversy. For exam=

on Foreign Relations, a plan, dead-on-arrival in Baghdad, for a soft petiti=

CHICAGO TRIBUNE // EDITORIAL BOARD
In the second round of the NCAA men's basketball tournament a few weeks ago=
, Texas A&M was in a hopeless spot, trailing Northern Iowa by 12 points wit=
h just 44 seconds remaining. Everyone knew A&M was done for. But the Aggies=
staged a stunning rally, sending the game into overtime, where they came o=
ut on top. Fans - particularly those in Iowa - learned then that victory ca=
n be elusive even when it looks certain. Ted Cruz, who like the Aggies is f=
rom Texas, needs a dramatic surprise to have a real chance of winning the R=
epublican nomination for president. But at least until Indiana votes on Tue=
sday, it's too early to assume Donald Trump has the nomination wrapped up. =
Plenty of observers, of course, are eager to pronounce him the GOP winner s=
o they can get on to obsessing about the general election. Trump himself, w=
ith a comfortable lead in the Indiana polls, shares that impulse.
