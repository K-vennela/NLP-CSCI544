Thanks for taking the time to talk to me.  I apologize for my hesitations, =
but her protection and hapiness is my greatest concern.  But I am sick of j=
ust thinking about the problem and not being invloved in the process to fix=
it which is why I contacted you in the first place.  It is confusing to kn=
ow what to do.  I will talk to her and get back to you.  You are very since=
re and knowledgable and I appreciate that.
Heil Hitler!
