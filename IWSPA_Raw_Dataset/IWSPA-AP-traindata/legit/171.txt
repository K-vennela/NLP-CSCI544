can you also check that Fortunat is addressing the few comments (ie revising the text) that
relate to his bit of my section and Henry Pollack is helping us to asses the comments and
revise the text to do with the Ground Surface Temperature section. I presume Ricardo and
Peck are dealing with all the regional stuff. Thanks
