Mike,
I want to get the more extensive London paper in first.
I hope my missive to the Chief Exec of the RMS does something next week.
By the way the HC doesn't have a Director.
John Mitchell is Head of Climate Science
Chris Gordon is Deputy Director of the HC.
It has never had a Director with that particular title.
It is impossible for anyone to find this on their web site. Only if you
were on the HC Scientific Review Group would you be aware.
Cheers
Phil
