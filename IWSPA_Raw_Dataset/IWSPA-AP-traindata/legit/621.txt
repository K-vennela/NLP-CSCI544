Dear All,
So now it seems that we're separating 'providing the code' from 'running the code'. I
can't
see the purpose of one without the other. Even if Mike complies I suspect there will need
to be several sessions of interaction, which neither side will be very keen on. As I said
before
I know the code will involve lots of combinations (for different periods with different
proxies).
Also I would expect, knowing the nature of the PC-type regression approach, that there
will
be library routines. If the code is sent, there needs to be conditions. We don't want
McIntyre
(MM) to come out and say he can't get it to work after a few days.
So, it is far some simple. I'm still against the code being given out.  Mike has made
the
data available. That is all they should need.  The method is detailed in the original
paper -
in the online (methods) and also in several other papers Mike has written.
As an aside, Mike is now using a different method from MBH98.  Also, as an aside,
whilst we've been deliberating, MM have submitted another comment on MBH98 to another
journal. In this they say they have a program that replicates MBH98 (although it isn't
very convincing that they have it exactly right, as they never show a like for like
comparison) , but
most of the comment goes on about the results being different due to different
combinations of
proxies. The latter isn't surprising.
It might appear they want the code to check whether their version works properly. If
this
is the case, then there are issues of IPR.  So, if they get the code, how do we stop them
using it for anything other than this review.
Cheers
Phil
