Thanks Tim,
am working my way through the comments
Have also re-read Mike Evans 2002 paper.
I am frustrated with the associate editors comments. He seems to be overtly defending
Mike's reconstruction which are quite different in nature - i.e. he reconstructed 2 spatial
fields - the 1st being ENSO related and the 2nd being probably related to the PDO although
it is not clear form the text.
The coral data-sets are also quite different, with only ~ 4 series being common to both
studies. In fact, many of the coral series used by Mike did not pass my screening process.
Lastly, the only statistic use by Mike for validation is the correlation coefficient. I
like to think I have been a little more robust at least in this regard.
I need to diplomatically word all this. I never wanted to criticise Mike's work in anyway
way. It was for that reason that I made little mention to it initially.
anyway, I hope to get a more cleaner version done by early next week.
will keep you all posted
Rob.
PS. do you have the FORTRAN code for Ed Cook's SSA software?
