Tim, thanks a bunch. This all sounds very good. We're finalizing a 
pseudoproxy paper for JGR based on the various tests w/ the CSM 
simulation I showed in Wengen, and will send you a guys a copy once its 
finalized. A natural followup would be a similar analysis applying to 
the ECHO-G simulation, and we would enjoy collaborating w/ you and Keith 
on this. We were also thinking of doing some "mixed signal" analyses, 
where the pseudoproxies represent a combinatiiion of temp and precip 
(including limiting cases of pure temp and pure precip). This might be a 
natural way to incorporate the ECHO-G results. We'll let you know if we 
have any trouble w/ format, etc.
thanks again,
mike
