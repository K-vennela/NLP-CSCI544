Tom,
What you'd need to point this out is a pdf of his thesis!  Or is there a paper where
the thesis is referred to?
I recall Pat wasn't very good at writing stuff up. There was one paper about warming in
Alaska that I recall either you or me reviewing. It related to surface warming in Alaska
and the borehole from Lachenbruch/Marshall (?) from about 1986.
With the pdf you wouldn't need to say that much, as it is as you say stupid to leave the
Trend in with the rest of the variance.
Did the NCDC info help you sort out that data. Tom P told me that they don't infill
certain areas in early decades, so there is missing data.  Tom P isn't that keen on the
method. He rightly thinks that it discourages them from looking for early data or including
any new stuff they get - as they have infilled it, so it won't make a  difference. It won't
make a difference, but that isn't the point.
Cheers
Phil
