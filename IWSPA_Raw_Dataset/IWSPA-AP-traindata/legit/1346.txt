Great. I'll play with both the composite series and the three  
individuals. I was hoping to get some spatially distributed  
information, so might include all three. I will also subdivide by  
proxy time and use PCA to examine spatial patterns.  I'll take a stab  
at revising the text to include a few sentences about how we chose  
the tree-ring series.  Then maybe you can take a look on Monday.   
Have a good weekend. Darrell
