Dear Ms Pascal,
The Emirates Skywards Future Artists competition is back and we need your help to choose the winners that will feature on our 2015 membership cards. All you need to do is vote online for your favorite artwork.
We’ve invited artists to enter a creative artwork based on just one theme: Hello Tomorrow. Our judges have shortlisted 20 entries to make it through to the final stage. Now it’s over to you to choose the one that you think best captures the spirit of Emirates and will make an inspiring card design.
Your vote will help shine the spotlight on these aspiring artists and showcase their work on a worldwide stage. You can vote until August 26 and we’ll reveal the winning artworks on emirates.com.
