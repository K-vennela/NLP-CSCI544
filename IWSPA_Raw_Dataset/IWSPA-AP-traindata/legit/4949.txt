Dear Mike,
Yes, I am aware of the confusion surrounding what the Hadley Centre did
and why.  It is even messier than you realize.  I have forcing data sets
(more than one!) from Jonathon Gregory that differ from the numbers you
gave in your email!!  The Hadley people have clearly screwed things up,
but their "errors" don't really matter given all of the uncertainties.  I
didn't mention this because I thought that opening up that can of worms
would confuse people even more.
In my view (trying to keep things as simple as possible), the key points
are these: 
(1)  The HadCM2 run purports to be IS92a, and it is a good approximation
to this.
(2)  Their use of 1% compounded for CO2 *is* a reasonable approximation to
the IS92a GHG forcing (which, itself, is uncertain).
(3)  The climate model output is also uncertain.
(4)  The pure CO2 input to IS92a is what I have distributed from the Bern
model.
(5)  Hence, the best and simplest combination is to use HadCM2 climate
output with these (point (4)) *a priori* defined "pure" CO2 concentrations
for IS92a.
