Tim - thanks for the update. Just think of the beer at the end of the 
tunnel. This week's deadline is a TSU deadline for figs being 
considered for the Tech Summary. You're looking good to get some of 
your figs/science in the TS, and this means big impact. Hopefully, 
provides the extra juice to find the extra time needed to get them 
done.
thx, peck
