TeenScreen questioned
Re: Leslie McGuire's April 6 letter on TeenScreen:
Sorry, but I don't buy the fact that TeenScreen is a
"voluntary" mental health program.
The March 23 letter by David Agami makes valid points,
and anyone objective can see that.
If TeenScreen is voluntary, why the passive consent?
What are you afraid of?
As the mother of an autistic child, I have done
extensive research into children's "mental health"
problems and discovered some major contributing
factors to children not doing well.
Parents don't make enough time for their kids,
resulting in children who don't have an open line with
their parents. That was the first thing I changed with
my daughter.
TeenScreen doesn't solve this problem; it puts another
wedge in it by referring the child to a therapist
rather than their parent for some quality time.
Then there are the matters of adequate sleep,
exercise, little to no sugar and TV and a healthy
diet. These basics alone make major changes.
