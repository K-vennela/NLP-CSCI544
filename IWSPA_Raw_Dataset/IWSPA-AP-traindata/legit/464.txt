Thanks Ed
Can I just say that I am not in the MBH camp - if that be characterized by an unshakable
"belief" one way or the other , regarding the absolute magnitude of the global MWP. I
certainly believe the " medieval" period was warmer than the 18th century - the equivalence
of the warmth in the post 1900 period, and the post 1980s ,compared to  the circa Medieval
times is very much still an area for much better resolution. I think that the geographic /
seasonal biases and dating/response time issues still cloud the picture of when and how
warm the Medieval period was . On present evidence , even with such uncertainties I would
still come out favouring the "likely unprecedented recent warmth" opinion - but our
motivation is to further explore the degree of certainty in this belief - based on the
realistic interpretation of available data. Point re Jan well taken and I will inform him
