Confidential: Dennis Shea just had angiogram: 75% blockage: having open heart surgery
tomorrow morning.  He does not want this known till the operation results are known.
============
This is awful stuff and I can't imagine that this could be published.  I know of this
fellow Peiser though and he is extremely biased (against you likely).  So treading with
caution is warranted.  The email seems to invite a comment but not a review.  You should
probably only respond with something that you would not mind being published.  You can also
point out errors of fact.  Whether you point out errors of logic or opinion is another
matter altogether.  If you write just to the editor you can try to evaluate the comment and
point out that it lacks substance.
I think my approach would be to try to stick to science.e.g.
I don't know what was done for the 1990 paper but obviously sound practice is
1) we attempt to use homogeneous data
2) Site moves are one indication of lack of homogeneity but there are standard means of
adjusting for such moves especially when there is an overlap in the record.
3) All data are scrutinized for possible problems and discontinuities, especially if there
is a question about a possible move and the date is known.
4) Site movements do not necessarily prejudice the record toward warming or cooling: a move
from the inner city to an outlying airport can result in cooling, for instance.
5) Revisions are made when new information becomes available.
6) It is helpful if researchers can improve the records and provide updated analyses.
Or something to this effect.  You could try a patronizing approach of over explaining the
difficulties.
At the very least you should be critical of the statement in 4. that he "politely requested
an explanation".  He quotes you as saying:
"Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something
wrong with it?".[1][1]
