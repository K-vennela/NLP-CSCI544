Dear Fortunat (and others),
Here is the revised section 6.5.8. I've put in most of your changes (and also most of
those suggested by Stefan, particularly with regards to clarifying the sign of the
radiative forcing). Most importantly, I've removed the table - I agree it seems to imply
a solidity that is really not there. The one thing I have not done is condense it
greatly (of course!). The real reason for going into such detail, rather than just
saying, "well, the forcing and response are uncertain, so we can't conclude anything",
is I think it's important to show that paleoclimate scientists have gone to some effort
to try to deduce climate sensitivity from the paleorecord, the parameter that is
probably of most interest to IPCC. In that respect the details are important, as are the
magnitudes of uncertainty represented in the different studies. Obviously, at any point
in the proceedings the section can be shortened, but I thought it useful to start with
this level of quantification, and show paleoclimate has this similarity with the rest of
IPCC in addition to more qualitative concepts.
I've responded to your individual comments below.
