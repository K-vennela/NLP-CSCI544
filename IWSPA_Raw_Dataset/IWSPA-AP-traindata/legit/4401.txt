For six years, the Advice from Counsel study has shared the opinions of inside counsel about the e-discovery process. For this year's study, we asked litigation support teams to share their advice on how counsel can make e-discovery more efficient and cost-effective. In this informative webcast, we'll share the survey results and give you the inside scoop on how the lit support team thinks you're doing, looking especially closely at how you could be saving money through processes and technology. Is it pretty? Not always. Does it promise to be an interesting discussion with lots of practical advice? You bet. Register today for this complimentary webcast!
