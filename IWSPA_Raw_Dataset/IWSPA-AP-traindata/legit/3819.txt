Hi Bill,
This is Joanna and Jeff told me that you are very knowledgable when it
comes to Odinism. I have a mythology class and I have to write a 5000 word
paper and I was wondering if you could possibly help me.
What I have to do is:
Compare at least TWO different mythical hero's, one from each culture of
your choice.
a) Identify similarities and differences in the personalities and adventures
of your respective hero's,
b) Try to account for these similarities and differences;
c) How far does each hero fit Lord Raglan's general "biographical" scheme?
Try to answer ALL the above points as fully as possible.
I am choosing THOR vs. JESUS..
If you can help me that would be really nice, if you can't thank you
anyways.
I will see you at Nationals.
Thank you
Joanna
