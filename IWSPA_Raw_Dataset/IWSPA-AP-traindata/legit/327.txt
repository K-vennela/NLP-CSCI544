Tim,
I suggest we let Eos size the figures, etc. Then, in the end, we can simply substitute a
version of Figure 2 w/ the correlations added at the proof stage. Anything else will slow
down the publication of the manuscript unnecessarily, in my opinion.
Phil and I have already discussed--we agree that the low weight given to the record in the
Mann and Jones composite treats the record appropriately...
