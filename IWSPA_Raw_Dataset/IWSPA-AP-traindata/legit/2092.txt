After the most cursory glance at the fan fiction study and the international study bob gave me we have some real issues with what we need  to make  sure we deliver on in our movie 
It's is clear Mavis her relationship with her father and her boyfriend are really key issues and we are gonna need to make  adjustments ASAP to take advantage of that information
Latin America Russia and china are the biggest territories for us
France uk and Germany are more modest in comparison with other animated franchises but are our second biggest markets
Brazil and Australia come after that
Father daughter, extended family,fish out of water( really important esp in places like france) funny monsters are the key.... Drac and Mavis is the center of everything 
Clearly introducing a baby is dicey and needs to get handled carefully cuz Mavis as a mom is not as relatable and the rel between drac and Dennis is not nearly as important as his relationship with Mavis
The study also suggests we need a major song at the end if the movie
Some of the things we have cut out of the movie or haven't emphasized enough 
Is the humanizing of the hotel
The monsters in the real world 
Mavis as a free spirit torn between two relationships 
Girly stuff which is in short supply
We actually had a lot more of this stuff in earlier drafts and I suggest we look at that and see what we can adjust since we sort of almost have time
Unfortunately we probably can't add back the original begining with Mitty judging project runway and frank on a talk show
The opening of drac playing with Mavis's dolls 
Is good  did we cut him spraying the drapes with fresh blood 
Also it was cute when we had drac saying holy rabbies as that was always what Mavis said
Also the breath joke was funnier when he was talking to the suit of armour and days seriously it's called flossing
It may be late but Mavis and her romance with jhonny are a big deal and we give the wedding pretty short shrift rand there is very little time in the movie she isn't a. Mom should we consider doing an actual scene here with her maybe there is something else we can cut
Is it worth having the scene where jhonny comes to drac to say Mavis wants to talk to you and the scene where she tells him the big news
There was once a suggestion of planting the idea early that Mavis loved growing up in the castle but worries that if her baby isn't a vampire that she doesn't want it to grow up in Transylvania ... That may be better than having to have a whole scene of spelling it out later  
If we plant that earlier the emotional story will start when we learn about the fangs at the birthday party and we will be alittle more with Mavis and what she is worried about as well as drac
I know we cut scenes to get the movie moving but I do restaurant scene
And the shrunken head waking him up like jhonny suggested to see Dennis and the dialogue about batman believe me that will be in the trailer if we have it
I also wonder if we really want to cut all the conflict between jhonny and Dracula over making the hotel more suitable for humans this is where so much of the comedy comes from and in stripping it down I'm worried we are gonna have no subtext and all plot because after all the movie is about humans and monsters living together and it was a very clever way of the story reflecting that in every aspect 
It's not an update of the acts it's about replacing monsters with humans 
Also the scene where Mavis and drac sing the monster lullaby to Dennis is a big deal
The new scene with the wolf pups willl be good for physical humour but it makes Mavis such a bummer that she is always worried about him getting hurt
I'm also not sure why we replaced the scene with Mavis at the buffet with drac and jhonny plotting it was more clever before we just laid everything out in dialogue also do we really want jhonny in the know to this extent
As I have said a million times we need  Dracula to be taking him somewhere specific even if they stop off at places along the way
What happened to Dracula making the wolf pups chase their tales and putting. Someone in charge if the hotel
