The Roundtable Queen has returned to her throne of glory!
We've got a roundtable for May 18th (location TBD, Washington, DC). New money is the priority so if you have folks that are sitting on their max out, this may be a way to get them in. Translation: Please don't send me comps (at least not yet).
Invite and details are forthcoming.
