Dear Keith and Tom,
thank you to include me in co-authors list of the paper.
I'm not sure that it is right, nevertheless I can't refuse. However,
if you consider to reduce number of co-authors I would not be offended
if you exclude me.
My corrections and suggestions:
1) Table S1: for Yamal - elevation 10-60 m, east - 70, north - 6730'
2) may be add reference to presence of frost rings in AD 536 in
Siberian pine in Mongolia (D'Arrigo et al., Climatic change, 49,
239-246, 2001) and frost and light rings in larch from Yamal (our
data)?
3) if possible, add to acknowledgments my thanks for funding to
Russian Foundation for Basic Research (project # 07-05-00989)
4) just to satisfy my curiosity - if dating of ice layers is not too
precise, why not suppose that first peak of sulphate deposits (about
AD 529 in fig. 3b) correspond to AD 536? May be two eruptions are
reason of relative long growth suppression? By the way, in larch from
Yamal frost rings formed in 536, 543 (two times as much as 536), and
545 (previous frost rings year was AD 404, next AD 627).
I'm sorry, I didn't reply to your previous letter concerning
manuscript to Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society. If it is
not too late, please correct my name in co-authors list (Rashit).
