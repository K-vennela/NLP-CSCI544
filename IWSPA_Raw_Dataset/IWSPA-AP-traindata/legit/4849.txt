Dear Keith,
Some days ago we have got "JOINT ANNOUNCEMENT OF
OPPORTUNITY" from International Arctic Research Center and Cooperative
Institute for Arctic Research University of Alaska Fairbanks. The
general theme is Global Change Research in the Arctic (full text with
description is attached bellow). As we have read Research Themes from
announcement they seem to be very congenial to our laboratory. What do
you think about this? Is there point in submitting proposal to IARC
and CIFAR at the University of Alaska Fairbanks? Research theme would
be 5,000 year summer air temperature reconstruction from tree rings
and impacts and consequences of global climate change on forest
ecosystems in the Polar Ural and Yamal Peninsula (Subarctic regions of
Russia).
We have no wide experience to submit proposal to any foreign
administration. We need in some advice. Could you give us a piece of
good advice how to do this well.
The questions are:
1. We are not sure whether this action and theme is contrary to our
future cooperative work?
2. If not, how big our chance to get award?
3. Could we submit a proposal from our Institute only without U.S.
partner? (Proposals from foreign institutions should preferably have a
U.S. partner. See description bellow). If U.S. partner should be, who
in your opinion would be?
Best regards.
Stepan.
