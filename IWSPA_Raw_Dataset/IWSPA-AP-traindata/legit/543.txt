Hi Jordan,
I just found out I'm supposed to go home to see my grandmother this weekend (things aren't looking good). I know I'm within two weeks of my event, but would it be possible to take a personal day this Friday for travel reasons? I should be on email for the full day apart from the hour-long flight.
Thanks,
Dan
