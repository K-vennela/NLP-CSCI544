Dear Keith, thanks for the update. I think I am reading much the same 
message as you do. I also agree that we need focus, and not too many 
groups involved. In terms of where the focus should be I agree that 
DOCC is too wide, and my feeling now is to dissolve it and reorganise 
under another heading with fewer groups, perhaps as an IP if Brussels 
allows. I do not have any preconceived notions as to where the 
co-ordinations hould lie.
I agree with you that integration with biogeochemistry is not 
straight forward with Holocene climate variability except for the 
vegetation feedback which may be important.
I also know of one other palaeo-based initiative, ICON, dealing with 
the thermohaline circulation, coordinated by Rainer Zahn. We are 
involved. This will be submitted for the call just launched under the 
hot spots in the climate system heading, but may be brought over to 
the next call if unsuccessful (probably). We are involved there with 
a number of modelling centres and many of the palaeoceanography labs.
I guess we should discuss a bit further after summer has passed what 
to do. I am very keen on the science of Holclim and hope to be able 
to develop this initiative with you and others.
Last thing - any idea of when the conference Brussels wants is going 
to happen?.
I am away for two weeks on the Greek islands, but then I am back again.
Cheers,
Eystein
