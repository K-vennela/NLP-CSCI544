Erin-
Thank you for your prompt response.
David has a scheduling conflict at 4pm on Thursday. Would any of the following times work for Fred:
Thursday, May 19th
*         12-1:30pm
*         4:45-6:00pm
*         8:30-9:30pm
Friday, May 20th
*         7:30am-8:30am
If not, I can try to move some things around.
Thank you!
Clayton
