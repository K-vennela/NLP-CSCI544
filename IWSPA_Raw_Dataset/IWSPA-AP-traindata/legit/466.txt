Grant, Kevin,
Agree on the responses. It does just seem a case of removing a number of the
adjectives. It is important to keep the moral high ground in this, if just to show how a
comment on a paper should be written and submitted to the same journal that had the poor
paper in the first instance. Might be worth reiterating this if any of us get  called when
the comment does come out. There does seem a trend these days to slam a paper on blogs with
no attempt to submit a comment to a journal.
Agree on the running mean/derivative issue - the spectral diagram is better.
Scatter plots aren't that useful unless. They's might help with the (a) parts, but it's
obvious from the time series plots  and the r-squareds are so different!
Finally - there was this comment via Jim S from Neville Nicholls. I vaguely recall Angell
and Korshover papers
from that time. The attached refers to some of them - also found Newell and Weare. This
isn't the first, but it might be worth adding. Attached this one from Science as well.
