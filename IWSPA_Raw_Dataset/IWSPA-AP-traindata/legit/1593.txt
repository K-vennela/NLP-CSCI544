Here is an e-mail I recieved today, one of many from unit leaders in the
Party, Loyal committed people. The Party is stronger than ever! 88 From NSM
WI below:
88! To all National Socialist Movement membership.  Over the last several
weeks
we have heard from the Commander regarding the subjects of honor, duty, our
oaths, and the proper behavior of a Comrade. We are a National Socialist
organization, not a democracy, nor a social club, not a collection of
individuals, but a united force for our volk.  A NS organization is run on
the
Fuhrerprizip, a concept brought to us from our ancestors--trust and
obedience to
your superiors, responsibly and service to those in your command.  For too
long
some amongst us have forgotten that no one individual is important, as our
Fuhrer instructs, but that we are all in service to our volk. I personally,
and
on behalf of my state of Wisconsin, support all decisions of our Commander,
who
acts to unify us all in service to the movement that is the only hope for
our
people.  We have been through hard times before my Comrades, and will again
many
times before all is said and done.  From experience, we know that the mud
slinging will be fast and furious, pay no mind.  Accept information only
from
true sources, the rest is garbage. I am proud to be among you all, and to
call
you my brothers and sisters!
