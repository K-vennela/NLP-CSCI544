No worries, I can wait till next week!
It would be great to hear from you next week particularly if you
feel I have overlooked something, I am planning to submit a little
GRL paper on the detection results based on paleodata soon, and so a warning
if I am doing something wrong would be great.
Its not surprising that the detection results are stable, since other than volcanic
forcing is mainly driven by the low-f component anyway.
But it looks to me like the volcanic response is not smaller or even a bit larger in the
annual JGR data (except for one real real big peak in
the 1998 data).
Greetings, have a good weekend and good luck for Keith's back

Gabi,
I have printed the files, but I do not know the answer. Keith is off today with a
bad back -
seeing a chiropractor. I need to talk to him before we can reply. I will be away
Mon/Tues
next week, so we will not be able to reply until later next week.
Cheers
Phil
