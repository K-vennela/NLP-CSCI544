Hi Tim,
Thanks, I agree. I don't think there is any need for you/Keith to do 
this. We've pretty much got things under control at RC and it is 
probably wise to hold your ammunition for any possible comment to 
Science. In my view the McIntyre criticisms are weak and disingenous.But 
what's new w/ that?
