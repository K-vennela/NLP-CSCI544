Yes, sorry I've taken so long to reply.
Yes, you are quite right.
I guess we are looking to April 1998 at the very earliest. I heard that
some SMT projects take up to 2 years to get going even after they've
been approved due to wrangles over the budget. We have 1 million ECU for
3 years....so some project budgets will have to be cut. Yours looks
fine.
Yes, that'll do nicely!
Excellent!
We've had a problem contacting the Spaniards which is a bit of a blow
because they gave a nice geospatial feel to the project. The Norwegians
are proposing to conduct a high resolution study near Oslo..I think
they'll be interpolating locally collected data. I'll send you their
proposal as soon as I can get it into a little better shape but, in
principle, I think it would be best if you could, at this stage, just
stick to the low resolution work.
A brief update to your "partner information" would be great.
I'm putting some in the post for you.
many thanks..there are sure to be some.
All the very best
Richard
