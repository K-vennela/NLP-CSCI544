Dear Tim,
Thanks for your comments. Some responses to them are
given below. I'll be too busy for further correspondance
as I prepare for travel, leaving Friday morning for a week.
Since I will be away and unreachable through next wednesday.
I would thus request that you and Keith correspond with 
my co-authors Ray Bradley (who should be able to
respond upon his return from current travel on Sunday
/Monday) and Malcolm Hughes on the revisions (please cc to
me so I can read upon my return), as I will be unreachable.
I'm sure we can come up with something mutually agreeable
to all of us with this piece, as is my goal with IPCC, as
long as their is proper communication and mutual understanding
by all concerned. Lets strive for this--choice of language
is a nontrivial element...
best regards,
mike.
