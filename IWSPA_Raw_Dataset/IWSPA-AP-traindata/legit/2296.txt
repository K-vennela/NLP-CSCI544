Hi Phil
I am sure you know that this is not about the science.  It is an attack to
undermine the science in some way.  In that regard I don't think you can
ignore it all, as Mike suggests as one option, but the response should try
to somehow label these guys and lazy and incompetent and unable to do the
huge amount of work it takes to construct such a database.  Indeed
technology and data handling capabilities have evolved and not everything
was saved.  So my feeble suggestion is to indeed cast aspersions on their
motives and throw in some counter rhetoric.  Labeling them as lazy with
nothng better to do seems like a good thing to do.
How about "I tried to get some data from McIntyre from his 1990 paper, but
I was unable because he doesn't have such a paper because he has not done
any constructive work!"
There is no basis for retracting a paper given in Keenan's message. One
may have to offer a correction that a particular sentence was not correct
if it claimed something that indeed was not so. But some old instrumental
data are like paleo data, and can only be used with caution as the
metadata do not exist.  It doesn't mean they are worthless and can not be
used.  Offering to make a correction to a few words in a paper in a
trivial manner will undermine his case.
