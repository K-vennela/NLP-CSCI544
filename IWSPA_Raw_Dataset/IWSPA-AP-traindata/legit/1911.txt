Hi Mel - thanks. Since chap 6 CA Tim Osborn is an author on this paper, I'm sure he and
Keith have made the right call.
Thanks again, Peck

Subject: Tett et al. paper
Hi Peck and Eystein,
Although the deadline for additional accepted papers has now passed, this submission
comes from a CLA (Gabi Hegerl) so am forwarding on. Official acceptance of the Tett et
al. paper was 2 June. My understanding is that you already have a copy, but will forward
the copy sent in by Simon just in case.
Cheers,
Mel
