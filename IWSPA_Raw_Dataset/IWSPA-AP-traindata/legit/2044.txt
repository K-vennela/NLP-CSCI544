Mike
thanks for this. When time allows we will do a response to this poster and simply post it
on our web page. As others have said , the dating of the chronology in the Urals is not
wrong  - but the magnitude of the extreme years in the early Urals reconstruction were not
adjusted to account for inflated variance related to low chronology replication  - so they
are sort of right that the emphasis on 1032 is probably overdone.
Anyway thanks again
Keith
