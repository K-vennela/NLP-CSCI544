Hi all
Wow this is a nice analysis by Grant et al.  What we should do is turn this into a learning
experience for everyone: there is often misuse of filtering.  Obviously the editor and
reviewers need to to also be taken to task here.  I agree with Mike Mann that a couple of
other key points deserve to be made wrt this paper.  Making sure that the important
relationships and role of ENSO on interannual variability of global temperatures should
also be pointed out with some select references (as in recent emails and the refs
therein).  In terms of the paper, I recommend consolidating the figures to keep them fewer
in number if this is a comment: combine Figs 3 with 4 , and 6 with 7.  Make sure the plots
of spectra have period prominently displayed as well as frequency and maybe even highlight
with stipple some bands like >10 years.  Glad to sign on: I would need an acknowledgment
that NCAR is sponsored by NSF.
Regards
Kevin
