Thanks Ben,
You have the makings of a nice article.
I note that we would expect to 10 cases that are significantly different by chance (based
on the 196 tests at the .05 sig level).  You found 3.  With appropriately corrected Leopold
I suspect you will find there is indeed stat sig. similar trends incl. amplification.
Setting up the statistical testing should be interesting with this many combinations.
Regards, Tom

Dear Tom,
As promised, I've now repeated all of the significance testing involving
model-versus-observed trend differences, but this time using spatially-averaged T2 and
T2LT changes that are not "masked out" over tropical land areas. As I mentioned this
morning, the use of non-masked data facilitates a direct comparison with Douglass et al.
The results for combined changes over tropical land and ocean are very similar to those
I sent out yesterday, which were for T2 and T2LT changes over tropical oceans only:
COMBINED LAND/OCEAN RESULTS (WITH STANDARD ERRORS ADJUSTED FOR TEMPORAL AUTOCORRELATION
EFFECTS; SPATIAL AVERAGES OVER 20N-20S; ANALYSIS PERIOD 1979 TO 1999)
T2LT tests, RSS observational data: 0 out of 49 model-versus-observed trend differences
are significant at the 5% level.
T2LT tests, UAH observational data: 1 out of 49 model-versus-observed trend differences
are significant at the 5% level.
T2 tests, RSS observational data: 1 out of 49 model-versus-observed trend differences
are significant at the 5% level.
T2 tests, UAH observational data: 1 out of 49 model-versus-observed trend differences
are significant at the 5% level.
So our conclusion - that model tropical T2 and T2LT trends are, in virtually all
realizations and models, not significantly different from either RSS or UAH trends - is
not sensitive to whether we do the significance testing with "ocean only" or combined
"land+ocean" temperature changes.
With best regards, and happy holidays to all!
