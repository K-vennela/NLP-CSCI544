Keith,
It is purely a matter of resources, and since Simon will be doing the 
millenial stuff with the Hadley model within IMPRINT, and I think that 
probably my resources will be best focussed in some of the other work 
packages. But it is possible and I will try to do it if the opportunity 
arises.
Cheers
Paul
