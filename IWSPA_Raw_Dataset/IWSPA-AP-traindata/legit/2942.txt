If you like I can purchase the ticket before it gets any more expensive.  
Hello,
We have been talking with Niv about several projects, Pemex, Tamaulipas, Jalisco ect...  but he has expressed interest to speak to me face to face ASAP about one of these projects and does not want to talk over the phone.  I offered to speak during the installation of Tamaulipas but he said that sooner would be better.  Since my presents at Tamaulipas is not needed, I can see him this week.  Niv will be in Miami this week to meet with another supplier and suggested I meet with him on friday when he flies home.  
With that said, I can fly into Miami international airport and have lunch with him and come back that same day.  If approved could you please reserve these flights for me?  I arrive with time to meet with him, and leave around same time he needs to leave as well.  No hotel needed!
