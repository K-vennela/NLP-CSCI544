Dear Keith,
I just come back from Yamal. We collected subfossil wood in Yuribey
River basin (50-150 km northward of recent timberline) and have found
about one hundred remains of trees.
Before departure for Yamal, on July 17, I have sent you draft outline
of paper for Holocene. I asked Valery Mazepa to send it one more if
any problems in connection. Now Valery is in Polar Ural and I don't
know did you receive this outline.
Could you inform me about this.
Thank you.
Best regards,
