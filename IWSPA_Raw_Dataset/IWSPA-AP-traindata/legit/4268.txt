David, Peter, Ian,
Let's go for the week with Feb 25/26 in it. I could come down
for late on the 25th then spend most of the 26th discussing
Ian's work and also the Antarctic ideas. Presumably John Prior
and others will be available at some point on the 26th.
The Antarctic surface T data that are in CRUTEM3 have come
from my searches over the years and also from READER. Much of the
early stuff in READER has come from the archives here, except
where BAS have got the original digitized data from the Antarctic
Institutes in all the countries.
I also have some files of when some of the manned stations on the
ice have moved. These are forced moves, as the station moves, but they
have never been accounted for. Halley and Casey are affected.
There are issues to discuss about the AWSs and also, as David knows
from AOPC, work that Wisconsin are doing in putting together all
the historic US series. I've talked to them about this - mainly to try and
stop them calculating mean T a different way. If they do this it will
screw their series up. It all relates to them saying that the mean of
min and max is not a great way in the Antarctic to calculate mean T.
They say they can now do the mean of every 3 hours, but it needs the
historic series and the routine updating to change at the same
time - which is unlikely to happen.
Cheers
Phil
