Donald Trump has won the Delaware Republican primary, according to three television networks.
Trump's victory in Delaware was widely expected despite a lack of consistent polling from the state. With 16 delegates in the state, the haul is the smallest up for grabs on Tuesday night.
The Manhattan billionaire held one rally in the state over the last week, in Harrington last Friday.
"We have 378 entities registered in the state of Delaware, meaning I pay you a lot of money folks," Trump told his supporters. "I don't feel at all guilty, OK?"
Delaware awards its 16 delegates on a winner-take-all basis.
