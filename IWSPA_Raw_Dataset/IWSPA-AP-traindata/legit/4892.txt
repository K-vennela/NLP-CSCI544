PLAYBOOK BREAKFAST - "The GOP's 24-hour meltdown: Trump's promise to unify the Republican Party is in tatters, as an all-out civil war grips the GOP," by Nolan McCaskill, with Katie Glueck, Daniel Strauss, Nick Gass and Brianna Gurciullo: "[A] full-bore GOP civil war has broken out, dividing the party into factions that are providing fresh headaches for Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. Priebus on Friday tried to encourage his fellow Republicans to put down their arms. 
"Sitting down for a one-hour conversation with POLITICO's Mike Allen, [Priebus] repeatedly stated that it's just been three days since Trump became the presumptive nominee, and that it's going to take time for Republicans to absorb their new reality. Priebus said Trump understands that the party has to unify wide blocs of voters, and he dismissed the latest furor over Trump's tweet celebrating Cinco de Mayo with a picture of him tucking into a taco bowl.
"'He's trying, and honestly, he's trying and I will tell you what, I honestly think he understands that building and unifying and growing the party is the only way we're going to win ... I think he gets that.' Playing the role of chief GOP diplomat, Priebus empathized with Ryan." <<link>>
