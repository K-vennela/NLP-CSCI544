Ben (or, really, everybody else),
I don't know whether you have all seen the paper analyzing the observed
data that Ben and I sent to J. Climate ?? This is where the JGR paper
began, and it is useful to compare both papers. In the J. Climate paper
we  assessed the best fits using a subjective balance of raw and lowpass
filtered results. The reason for this was because of the difficulty of
setting up an automated procedure -- which is the problem that Ben is
currently having to deal with. In the next iteration of the JGR paper,
the reason for moving to a more automated procedure will be explained.
Both the subjective and automated procedures have their advantages and
disadvantages. The latter procedure, of course, is in no way
'objective'. Many subjective choices have to be made in setting up the
procedure. This is why the word 'automated' is used above, rather than
'objective'.
If you have not seen the J. Climate paper, let me know and I will send
you a copy. There is a companion paper that has been accepted by GRL
that I will send at the same time.
Cheers, Tom.
