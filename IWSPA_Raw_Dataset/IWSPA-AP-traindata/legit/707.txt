Dear Martin and all others,
Having read the new manuscript, I would like to draw the attention of 
all of you to the section about McIntyre&McKitrick vs Mann et al. I am 
not entirely happy with this section. It may be that I am not fully 
updated about  all details on their dispute, but it appears to be some 
mistakes in this section of our manuscript. Therefore, I ask all of you 
to check how this section can be improved and clarified. This is very 
important! If we refer incorrectly to the MM-Mann dispute, I am 
convinced that all of us will be involved in lengthy frustrating e-mail 
discussions later on. I anticipiate this from personal experience! Let's 
do our best to avoid this.
The problematic bit of text starts on p. 16, para 4: ("The failure of 
MM2003 ... is partly due to a misunderstanding of the stepwise 
reconstruction method") and slightly below: ("MM2003 only calculate 
principal components for the period when all chronologies are present").
I read through the MM2003 paper yesterday. From what is written there, 
on p. 763-765, it appears that they were well aware of the stepwise 
method. On p. 763, about at the middle of the page, they write: 
"Following the description of MBH98 ... our construction is done 
piecewise for each of the periods listed in Table 8, using the roster of 
proxies available through the period and the selection of TPCs for each 
period listed in Table 8".
This is clearly at odds to what is written in our manuscript. Has it 
been documented somewhere else that MM2003, despite what they wrote, 
really misunderstood the stepwise technique? If it is so, we need to 
insert a reference. If this is not the case, we need to omit the lines 
about the misunderstanding. We also need to explain better why the 
MM2003 calculations differ from MBH.
Moreover, our sentence ("MM2003 only calculate principal components for 
the period when all chronologies are present") imply that MM2003 only 
calculated PCs for the period 1820-1971, as this would be the period 
when all chronologies are present according to the MM2003 Table 8. 
Obviously, they calculated PCs beyond 1820, as their calculations 
actually extend back to 1400.
The problem continues in the legend to our Fig. 2. (" Each of the 212 
data series is shown ... The red rectangle indicates the single block 
used by MM2003, neglecting all data prior to 1619"). The last sentence 
is inconsistent with the information in MM2003 in three ways; a) MM2003 
clearly show in their Table 8 that they analysed the same blocks of data 
as MBH. b) The year 1619 as a starting point of a data block is 
inconsistent with MM Table 8. Where does the year 1619 come from? It is 
not mentioned anywhere in MM2003. c). The red block implies that MM2003 
made calculations back only to 1619, but they did back to 1400.
Moreover, the numbers given in the graph of our Fig. 2 indicate that the 
total number of series is 211, whereas the text in the legend and also 
in the main text on p. 16 says 212. Which number is correct?
I suppose that some of you others will know this subject much better 
than I. I have just read the MM2003 paper, and find our reference to it 
to be inconsistent with it. I hope you all can make efforts to make this 
bit crystal clear. If not, I fear we will get problems!
Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the related sentence in 
our conclusions on p. 26: ("Papers which claim to refute ... have been 
reviewed and found to contain serious flaws"). Are all of you happy with 
this statement? Would it sound better with a somewhat less offending 
sentence, something like:
"Papers which claim to refute ... have been reviewed and found to 
essentially contribute with insignificant information that does not 
affect the consensus, and even to include some flaws."
I attach the MM2003 paper.
I will send some comments to the other parts of the text in a separate mail.
Cheers,
Anders
