Hey Keith,
I hope your visit w/ your family went well...
I went ahead and tried to make some constructive comments on what you sent (figured it
would be nice to get this out of the way before the holidays come round)..
Let me say I think it's shaping up very nicely--looks like it should be a significant
improvement on the '01 report. You've handled the various controversies and points of
dispute delicately and adeptly, while still driving home in the end the key point (that the
evidence appears to point to anomalous late 20th century behavior).
I made a dozen or so minor comments--please make use of them as you see fit.
Lets reconvene on this after the holidays. Thanks again for including me in and giving me
an opportunity to comment.
I hope the rest of your holidays go well,
mike
