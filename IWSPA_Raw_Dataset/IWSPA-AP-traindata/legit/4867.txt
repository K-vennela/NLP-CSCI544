TED LETTER DAY: And then there were two. 
TED CRUZ left the GOP nomination fight tonight, a move that leaves Republicans' presidential hopes in the hands of DONALD TRUMP. As POLITICO's Katie Glueck and Shane Goldmacher report, Cruz's exit makes it a near certainty Trump will be the Republican nominee, even as Ohio Gov. JOHN KASICH pledged to stay in the race until Trump received the number of pledged delegates he needs to secure the nomination. 
Cruz's exit came after a furious fight for survival in Indiana, an effort that blended political tactics with some of his harshest, most visceral attacks of the campaign. In the end, Cruz conceded it wasn't enough: "From the beginning I've said that I would continue on as long as there was a viable path to victory," Cruz said, with his wife Heidi by his side. "Tonight I'm sorry to say it appears that path has been foreclosed."

WHAT MATTERS: Here are four more things to do we're watching today - and why they matter. 
2) HOOSIER NOMINEE: Very, very likely DONALD TRUMP. POLITICO's Kyle Cheney breaks down a night of triumph for the nearly presumptive GOP nominee. The contest was called for Trump as soon as polls closed. And he watched TED CRUZ, who launched his most aggressive personal attacks just hours earlier, exit the race. <<link>> In fact, Cruz couldn't even bring himself to mention Trump's name: <<link>> Trump was more conciliatory: "I have met some of the most incredible competitors that I have ever competed against right here on the Republican Party," the real estate mogul said. "Just so you understand, Ted Cruz, I don't
know if he likes me or if he doesn't like me, but he's one hell of a competitor." Meanwhile, the Never Trump movement seemed to sink further, as POLITICO's Matthew Nussbaum reports. <<link>> 
3) A DURABLE BERN: Just when you think the Democratic race is settling, behold another BERNIE SANDERS upset. The Vermont senator bested HILLARY CLINTON in Indiana, a victory that will not dramatically alter the delegate calculus but may cool calls for him to leave the Democratic race. Speaking in Louisville, Ky., Sanders praised his most loyal constituency: young voters. "I'll tell you what is extremely exciting for me, and that is that in primary after primary, caucus after caucus, we end up winning the vote of people 45 years of age and younger," Sanders said. The calendar also looks pretty good for Sanders, POLITICO's Nick Gass reports, with West Virginia up next on May 10, followed by
Kentucky and Oregon on May 17. Clinton did not have any election night remarks, but is set to appear in Washington tomorrow. <<link>> 
BLAST NOTE: It's been said, but let's repeat it: DONALD TRUMP is set to lock up the Republican nomination before HILLARY CLINTON secures the Democratic one. Politics are funny sometimes. 
4) STILL MAKING HIS KAS?: So, TED CRUZ and his more than 500 delegates are gone. But JOHN KASICH, who now trails two candidates no longer running (MARCO RUBIO and TED CRUZ), says he's plowing forward. "Tonight's results are not going to alter Gov. Kasich's campaign plans," read a memo from Kasich chief strategist John Weaver. "Our strategy has been and continues to be one that involves winning the nomination at an open convention." <<link>> 
5) TRUMP FOR JOY: Democrats seemed thrilled at the nearly realized prospect of DONALD TRUMP as the GOP nominee. POLITICO's Daniel Strauss reports the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee immediately pressed Republican Senate candidates to announce whether they support Trump. <<link>> The first flurry of comments is probably just a preview: Democrats believe that, with Trump at the top of the ticket, they can make gains across the board in November.  
TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Reince Preibus calls for unity, Mark Salter's seen enough, TED CRUZ gets memed and MITT ROMNEY isn't talking about you know who. 
THREE POINT SHOT? POLITICO's Glenn Thrush explains why a potential third party candidacy is one of the possibilities after tonight's election. <<link>> 
UNITY TIME: Reince Priebus says it's time for the party to rally around DONALD TRUMP. <<link>> 
CANTOR CANDOR: Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor says he underestimated DONALD TRUMP. <<link>> 
BLAST NOTE: He's not alone!
NEVER TWEET: MITT ROMNEY, leader of the Never Trump vanguard, thanks TED CRUZ and doesn't mention you know who. <<link>> 
STILL SALTER: Former John McCain adviser Mark Salter says he'll vote for HILLARY CLINTON. <<link>> 
SLAM DUNK: A retreating TED CRUZ met one of the Internet's most pervasive sports memes. Aye. <<link>> 
WHAT'S NEXT: A whole new day. DONALD TRUMP, presumptive Republican nominee, marches forward. JOHN KASICH, still in the race for now, heads West. HILLARY CLINTON and BERNIE SANDERS begin to focus on West Virginia and California, but first Clinton speaks in Washington on Wednesday.
THEY SAID IT: "We gave it everything we got, but the voters chose another path." - TED CRUZ, dropping out of the presidential race. <<link>> 
MAGIC NUMBER: 18. That's MARCO RUBIO's delegate lead on JOHN KASICH. Rubio got out of the race almost two months ago.
