Christoph,
It also looks OK to me. The bit highlighted in blue, should probably say
something like ...identify the key issues.
I agree with Mike that the last two names on the list should be removed.
I have sent an email about the 4th meeting of IPCC, which I
think is June 26-30, 2006. Just checking it is still that week, so
there won't be a clash.
Cheers
Phil
