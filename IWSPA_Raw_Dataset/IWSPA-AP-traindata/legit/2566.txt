Hey-
Vaughn and I are spearheading that DLC/WLF event with Robbie Kaplan & Gloria Allred on May 31st.  Not sure if he told you I was part of it or not.
I'm in Minneapolis over Memorial Day weekend for a baptism so was planning to buy a flight from MSP to NY on Monday, May 30.  Wanted to run it by you before I submitted for a flight.  Let me know if this is ok!
