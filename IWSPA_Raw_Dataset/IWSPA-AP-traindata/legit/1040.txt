Hi Keith - great (!) to hear from you - hope you had a good holiday. 
Your reward (ha) is the attached paper and comment below from Konrad. 
He can supply data if needed for a synthetic figure, but we can add 
this later once the Science paper he mentions (w/ us a co-authors 
among millions, I assume) gets vetted more. Your call.
I'm still not convinced about the AO recon, and am worried about the 
late 20th century "coolness" in the proxy recon that's not in the 
instrumental, but it's a nice piece of work in any case.
Now, for all the issues you raise on other stuff in your email, I'll 
address to you and that crowd.
thanks, Peck
