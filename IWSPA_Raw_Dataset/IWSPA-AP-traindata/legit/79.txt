Ben,
It seems that Climate Audit has been discussing the paper. I ad
a look whilst I was in Iceland as I had nothing better to do a few times.
It was cold and snowy outside, there was internet.....
Seems as though they are making some poor assumptions; someone
is trying to defend us, but gets rounded upon and one of the co-authors
on the paper is in touch with McIntyre.
As it isn't me, and I can rule out a number of the others, my list of who
it might be isn't that long....
Looking forward to next week !!
Cheers
Phil
