Dear All (especially Chris/Catherine),
Here's the latest draft of WP1. All in the group have now commented and amended this.
You should have the 3 supporting letters from Tree partners. Eric was contacting Eric
Steig and Sandy (see below) is contacting 3 coral people.
There is an issue about a Map. Rob W put one in his PhD page. This shows the corals. If
we were to add the tree-ring sites we would mainly get a splodge of points in South America
and NZ. Ice cores would just be over the AP and in the low-lat Andes. Issue is one of
space. We already have 3pp fo this WP. Refs will reduce to about 0.5pp once we go to et al
for 3 or more authors. A map would be useful for presentation to NERC, but is it essential
for the submission?
I'm away from tomorrow lunchtime for the weekend. Back in on Monday. Hope we'll be
looking through more complete drafts next week!
Cheers
Phil
