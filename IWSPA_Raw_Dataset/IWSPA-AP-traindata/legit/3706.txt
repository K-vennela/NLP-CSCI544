If you're not getting personal, you're missing potential.
Did you know, a recent study conducted by responsys reported that:
61% of consumers had a positive feeling towards brands whose messages were personalized
53% said they were more likely to make a purchase when communications were personalized
52% said they trusted brands that allowed them to share their marketing preferences
Multi-channel loyalty programs provide marketers with the kinds of first party data that makes it possible to quickly and easily deliver personalized messages to each customer in a way that's totally scaleable.
