Dear Tim,
attach the data (erikII.dat): NH averages with standard latitude weighting.
Yes, the forced simulations are identical in forcing, just different initial conditions.
Just for complementary info on the data file a rough plot of  the data in the file
erikII.dat in comparison with NH avgs in ErikI: ErikI-II.ps
Also for commplementary info, I attach nhavg.jpg and nhano.jpg...plots of anomalies and
absolute values in the NH for all the forced runs:
columbus erikI,II and control.
Let me know if there are any queries or problems.
Best regards
Fidel
ps.- I will be glad to have a pdf of the magicc paper when you consider it appropriate.
Congratulations for this.
