Team,
With Indiana voters casting their ballots on Tuesday, we should update you =
on our candidates=92 pledged delegate count once again. Secretary Clinton h=
as been allocated 1,716 pledged delegates, while Senator Sanders=92 current=
pledged delegate count is 1,433. The magic number to secure the nomination=
can still be defined as 2,383 delegates. Patrice and the entire Party Affa=
irs Team are diligently working to keep us informed as we continue to move =
through these contests. Oregon voters will be participating in their primar=
y this upcoming Tuesday, but as was stated in the All Staff Meeting on Wedn=
esday, the next delegate-rich primary day will not be until June 7, with co=
ntests in California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Dakota.
During the All Staff Meeting, we also took a closer look at the framework f=
or the Party=92s messaging with an update from the Communications Departmen=
t. This was nicely accompanied with our Surrogate Operations presentation, =
showcasing the tools we have implemented to cultivate messengers, or what w=
e call =93leads" at a grassroots level. All of this was capped with an over=
view of the communities we are honoring this month. Thank you to all of the=
teams who worked to show us something special at our May All Staff Meeting=
=96 I am excited to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and Je=
wish American Heritage Month with you this May.
Additionally, I was kept very busy at the end of the week with Polish engag=
ement events at the DNC, the White House, and on the Capitol. We are rampin=
g up for outreach with many more ethnic and constituency groups in June. St=
ay tuned for our upcoming adventures in New York, New Jersey, and Pittsburg=
h (that city needs a little love with all the activity surrounding its neig=
hboring DNCC host city).
As always, feel free to touch base with me by submitting your questions and=
comments to user@domain.com.
All my best,
Amy
