Can we discuss tomorrow ? De : Brune, Eric 
We should really discuss, and maybe involve SPA who seems to have an opinion about competition. De : Alexander, Ralph 
Your proposal makes good sense. Let's discuss further tomorrow.
Dear Ralph, Following our conversation last Friday, I’m now wondering if Christmas would not be an option to release Hotel  T 2.Obviously, as always, both periods( All Saints and Christmas) are very competitive, so the choice is not easy to make.Today the situation is a follow in terms of competition for the family films: ALL SAINTS PERIOD:Oct 7: Le Petit PrinceOct 14: Hotel T, The Jungle Book, Les Nouvelles Aventures d’Alladin( live action film, seems to be a satirical version of Alladin, for teens and older kids, let  say 8 to 20, but we don’t have a lot of infos about the film yet)As a reminder, we are releasing the Bond on Oct 23. CHRISTMAS PERIOD: Dec 2: The Good DinosaurDec16: Peanuts. We are also releasing InfernoDec18 (Friday): StarWarsSo there would be a spot on Dec 9 for Hotel T. Can we discuss this week? BestEric
