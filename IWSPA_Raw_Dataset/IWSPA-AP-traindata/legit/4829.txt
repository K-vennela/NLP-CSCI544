Thanks to Tim and Keith for that correction.
I've inserted that, and also reworded the paragraph in the conclusions which 
talked about "serious flaws" along the lines suggested by Tim. It now reads:
"The IPCC2001 conclusion that temperatures of the past millennium
are unlikely to have been as warm, at any time prior to the 20th
century, as the last decades of the 20th century is supported
by subsequent research and by the results obtained here.
We have also reviewed and, in some cases, tested with new
analysis, papers which claim to refute that IPCC2001 conclusion and
found that their claims are not well supported."
This version attached with the revised supplementary material.
I need to go over the `changes' document again, and the response, but I hope 
to send it in on Monday.
cheers,
Martin
