Here are some of the issues as I see them:
Saying it is natural variability is not an explanation.  What are the physical processes?
Where did the heat go?  We know there is a build up of ocean heat prior to El Nino, and a
discharge (and sfc T warming) during late stages of El Nino, but is the observing system
sufficient to track it?  Quite aside from the changes in the ocean, we know there are major
changes in the storm tracks and teleconnections with ENSO, and there is a LOT more rain on
land during La Nina (more drought in El Nino), so how does the albedo change overall
(changes in cloud)?  At the very least the extra rain on land means a lot more heat goes
into evaporation rather than raising temperatures, and so that keeps land temps down: and
should generate cloud.  But the resulting evaporative cooling means the heat goes into
atmosphere and should be radiated to space: so we should be able to track it with CERES
data.  The CERES data are unfortunately wonting and so too are the cloud data.  The ocean
data are also lacking although some of that may be related to the ocean current changes and
burying heat at depth where it is not picked up.  If it is sequestered at depth then it
comes back to haunt us later and so we should know about it.
