TeenScreen's PR firm is really getting desperate. The
whole program is really taking a beating from the
petition, our letters, and from group after group
coming on board to stop the fraud.
They've infiltrated yet another newspaper to print
another "fluff" article.
Are we going to let it go by unchallenged? I don't
think so.
Here's your assignment.
1. Read the article:
<<link>>
2. Write a letter to the editor.
-If your last name ends in A-F, write anything you
want as long as it's against TeenScreen. You can go to
www.psychsearch.net/teenscreen.html if you need
hatting on what to write.
-If your last name ends in G-N, write about how
TeenScreen is completely inappropriate in a Catholic
school, being based on the anti-religious message of
psychiatry/psychology. If you need hatting on what to
write, go to this website:
<<link>> If you've never
seen it, you'll find it very enlightening.
-If your last name ends in O-Z, pick some glaring
outpoint in the article and write about them. Here are
a couple off the top of my head but I'm sure you can
find more:
OUTPOINT 1 - The administrator revealed that some
children had positive results. Records are supposed to
be completely confidential. Even a release of general
numbers is unacceptable.
OUTPOINT 2 - They have had psych programs running
"through the years" and have had suicides, most
recently in 2004.
OUTPOINT 3 - No definition is given for UAMS, the
outfit that administered the TeenScreen. It is
certainly an outside, for-profit psych facility

May God bless all of you.
