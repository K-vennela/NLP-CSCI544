Susan,
Thanks for the quick reply. Kevin might have thoughts, but I'll give it some thought
over the next few months. It isn't crucial till well after our second meeting.
Kevin can relay our thoughts on references next week, and we can come up
with specific suggestions here if these need to be discussed with WG2 and WG3
before all the second lead author meetings. I know we can reduce our number of
references with more work, but I suspect we will be requested at the time of the
FOD and SOD (and maybe the ZOD) to consider many others. A lot of NMSs,
University Depts. and Research Institutes measure success as seeing their work
cited by IPCC !  I reviewed KNMI this time last year and they did exactly this.
This shouldn't be a measure, but we will likely be under pressure to cite many
more papers for this reason.
Cheers
Phil
