I'm fairly certain that tomorrow can't happen.  We would have to have the payment request approved by the end of the day and neither Michael or Dave are here today and Dave isn't hear until Monday.   There is a very, very slim chance we can make tomorrow.   And slim chance we can make Monday. Tuesday is the safe day.  I think we should tell Mark E's reps that Tuesday is the day and we'll do better if we can.  We happen to have necessary approvers in Tokyo and in route back from Tokyo.
