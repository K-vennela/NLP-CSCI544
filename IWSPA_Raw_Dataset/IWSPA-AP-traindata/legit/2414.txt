Grant el al
All good to me apart from adding in the IPCC 2007 WG1 Chap 3 reference.
I checked with IJC chief editor here (Glenn McGregor) and editors 
usually like to publish comments asap, and send them only to the 
original authors to respond to as soon as possible.
So once the USA contingent has signed it off 'today' (Friday) and 
submitted it, I will send a copy to our Australian colleagues for 
information.
All good stuff
