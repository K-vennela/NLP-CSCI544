Donald Trump has won the West Virginia Republican primary, according to three separate news networks.
Though he is the only candidate left running on the Republican side of the race, Trump rallied supporters in Charleston last Thursday. While there, Trump laid into Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton for her comments in March that she would work to "put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."
West Virginia elects its 34 delegates directly on the primary ballot.
