SHARE: It seems like there is a VC deal coming out of Russia every week, like Moscow-based Zvooq's recent $20 million (RUB724 million) Series A, which you can read about below. The country saw over $3 billion (RUB108 billion) of venture capital invested in 2011 and 2012 combined, according to the PitchBook Platform. And between 2011 and 2013, the number of VC deals completed each year remained remarkably consistent, staying between 72 and 76. So things are going well, right? Upon closer examination, not exactly.Although deal flow remained strong and steady those three years, the amount of capital invested into Russia has declined severely as of late, dropping from $1.5 billion (RUB54.2 billion) in 2012 to $306 million (RUB11.1 billion) in 2013—a decrease of about 80%; and over one-third of last year's total came from one deal—Lamoda's $130 million (RUB4.7 billion) round. 2014 hasn't fared much better. The year has seen just $283 million (RUB10.2 billion) in capital invested thus far, and with only 25 completed deals to date, it will almost surely produce a four-year low in terms of deal count. A big contributor to the slowdown in invested capital has been the downshift of large deals. In 2011, 16 deals of $25 million (RUB904 million) or more were completed in Russia, representing 33% of the year's invested capital; last year, there were just two such deals, representing only 3% of the capital invested in the year.
