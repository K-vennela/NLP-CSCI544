Hi Tom - please find the Esper article in question attached. The 
so-called Indigirka River data set is not yet available because it has 
not been  published. I am currently working on that with Russian 
colleagues, and was indeed in Switzerland the week before last to work 
with one of them on specifically this. All being well, there will be an 
accepted manuscript before next summer, and at that point I will make 
the data freely available. Once we get to that point, I'll let you know, 
of course. Cheers, Malcolm
