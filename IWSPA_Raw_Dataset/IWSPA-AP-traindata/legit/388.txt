Dear Ed, Tom, Keith, etc.
In keeping w/ the spirit of Tom's and Keith's emails, I wanted to stress, before we all
break for the weekend, that this is ultimately about the science, its not personal. If my
comments seemed to assail e.g. Keith's motives or integrity, etc. I believe that they were
misunderstood (as  I tried to clarify that in my previous message), but I can see that
there was a potential for misunderstanding of my message (precision in wording is very
important) given the high levels of sensitivity in this debate. So I wanted to leave no
uncertainty about that. And of course, I very much apologize to Keith (and Tim) if they
took them my comments that way. They, again, were most decidedly not intended that way.
I hope we can resolve the scientific issues objectively, and w/out injecting or any
personal feelings into any of this. There are some substantial scientific differences here,
lets let them play out the way they are supposed to, objectively, and in the peer reviewed
literature.
Enjoy the weekend all.
cheers,
Mike
