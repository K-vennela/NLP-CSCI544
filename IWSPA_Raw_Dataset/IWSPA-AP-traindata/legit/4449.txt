HOW DO YOU REALLY FEEL: Hey, John Boehner, remember him? 
Well, TED CRUZ sure does. 
The former House Speaker left the political stage months ago but returned with force, delivering a borderline NSFW soundbite in which he called Cruz, "Lucifer in the flesh" and "the most miserable son of a bitch" he's ever worked with. <<link>> 
The salty anti-endorsement, as first reported by the Stanford Daily, <<link>> comes at an inopportune time for Cruz. He is, after all, the candidate seeking to consolidate establishment Republicans in an effort to stop DONALD TRUMP. Cruz's response was to, what else, compare Boehner to Trump.
Boehner "allowed his inner Trump to come out," Cruz said.
Same party name-calling is one thing. But Boehner's comments shifted the focus from Trump just as Cruz hopes to mount a last stand in Indiana. That job is harder now.

TGIT. Here's your 2016 Blast. Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through the day's campaign news, so send your tips, complaints and most scorching hot takes to user@domain.com. 
WHAT MATTERS: Here are four more things we're watching today - and why they matter. 
2) ACCEPTANCE AND DENIAL: Another day with DONALD TRUMP steamrolling toward the Republican nomination meant another day of recognition - or denial. The real estate mogul picked up the endorsement of House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster <<link>> and a former top MITT ROMNEY aide, Ron Kaufman, said he was similar to Ronald Reagan. <<link>> Meanwhile, Senate Republicans, as POLITICO's Burgess Everett reports, are trying to act like Trump is not even there. <<link>> In the House, Republicans are grappling with how to co-exist, too, POLITICO's Rachael Bade and Jake
Sherman report: <<link>> 
3) BERNING DOWN: HILLARY CLINTON's Democratic rival crept closer to his endgame today. As POLITICO's Gabriel Debenedetti reports what BERNIE SANDERS wants as he leaves the race - a mix of Democratic platform planks and, perhaps, reforms in the party's nominating process - show he's thinking about the end. <<link>> He cut spending sharply in Indiana <<link>> His wife, Jane Sanders, did not seem to be in retreat: She predicted an epic comeback: <<link>> 
4) SELF FUNDED*: DONALD TRUMP has made his wealth, his lack of beholdenness to other wealthy people and his promise to self-fund his campaign pillars of his message. But Trump seems to be having second thoughts about this. Paul Manafort, a top Trump aide, says in a radio interview with Laura Ingraham that Trump has actually not yet decided whether he will accept large contributions from outside donors for a general election. "Well the point is that Donald Trump has been making on the campaign trail is that he's financing his own campaign," Manafort told Ingraham. But he added: "When it comes to the general election, we are no longer running as an individual, we are running as the head of a
ticket," he continued. <<link>> You can listen to the whole show here: <<link>> 
5) ABOUT THAT ALLIANCE ... It has not even been a week since TED CRUZ and JOHN KASICH floated a strategic alliance where Cruz would compete hard in Indiana and Kasich would promote himself as the Trump alternative in western states. That was Sunday night. Today, Thursday, Cruz professed no "alliance" at all: "I recognize that the media is all eager to talk about an alliance," Cruz told reporters at a stop in Fort Wayne, Indiana. "There is no alliance. Kasich and I made a determination of where to focus our energies, where to focus our assets, where to focus our resources." <<link>> Around the same time this quote came out, a top Kasich aide, John
Weaver, tweeted: "I can't stand liars." <<link>> Though he didn't elaborate, Weaver had recently retweeted a negative story about Cruz.
TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Bobby Knight has some things to say, TED CRUZ can't contain himself, CARLY FIORINA emerges, DONALD TRUMP will find protesters in California and Bill Richardson thinks BERNIE SANDERS should chill out. 
KNIGHT'S WATCH: Bobby Knight said DONALD TRUMP could have played for him, and also compared him to Harry Truman as they campaigned in Indiana. <<link>>

CHILL BILL: Former New Mexico Gov. and one-time presidential hopeful Bill Richardson thinks BERNIE SANDERS should tone it down. (CNBC) <<link>> 
TABLE TALK: A Washington Post reporter explains what it was like to sit next to DONALD TRUMP at the 2011 White House Correspondents' dinner when he was mocked by President Obama. <<link>> 
WHAT'S NEXT:
DONALD TRUMP makes a campaign visit to California tonight. HILLARY CLINTON and BERNIE SANDERS focus on Indiana. TED CRUZ has events there, too. 
THEY SAID IT: 
"I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life."
- John Boehner, on TED CRUZ. <<link>> 
MAGIC NUMBER: 33. That's the percentage of Pew respondents approving of the GOP - the party's lowest since 1992. <<link>>
