NSM Milwaukee: After Action Report
The event in Milwaukee was a great success. A large number of National
Socialists gathered for the town hall forum, and it was and Honor to be
there. Waffen SS veteran (and Adolf Hitler Memorial Hall owner) Theo Junker
gave the keynote address to close out the meeting.
Dozens of NSM members and supporters were sworn in, and took their Oath of
Loyalty to the Party Publically at the end of the meeting. A number of new
members had applications ready and joined the Ranks on the spot at the
meeting. We welcome all the new members, and Salute all of the members and
supporters who took their oaths, for now you are bound to the Party by your
Honor.
Honor and the Oath:

A November 9th Reading of the Martyrs was initiated by M. Sgt. Boswell at
the after Party event, and great Comeraderie was also had by Comrades in
attendance from WI., MN., IL., MO., KS., ND., and one Comrade even came in
from as far away as New York for the event.
NSM Wisconsin is to be commended once again for putting on yet another
successfull event. There was so much more to report on, but NSM Wisconsin
already mentioned most of that in their report. Watch for pictures of the
event coming soon at www.nsm88.org
Hail Victory!
