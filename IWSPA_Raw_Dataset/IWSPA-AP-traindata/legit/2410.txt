Team,
In observance of Memorial Day, the DNC Office will be closed on Monday, May 30th. In accordance with our Employee Handbook, please remember to consult with your Department Director and supervisor to ensure that all necessary projects are completed and that you are available to respond Monday should any urgent issues arise.
Have a wonderful and safe holiday weekend, and thanks for all your hard work.
Lindsey
