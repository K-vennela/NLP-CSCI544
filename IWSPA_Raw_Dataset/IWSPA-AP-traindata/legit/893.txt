Comrades,
2 weeks ago I sent out the Rally Pre-link up location to know Patriots/NS attending the Omaha Rally. Today I was notified that instead of being there by 12 noon, you must be at that pre-link up location at 11:15 AM. Just to be sure get out there by 11 AM. All fo those who contacted me should have the Contact #'s and details, if not, you should never wait untill the last minute to make plans. Hail Victory! Commander Schoep/ www.nsm88.com
