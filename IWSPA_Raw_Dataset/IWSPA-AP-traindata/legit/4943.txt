Kevin,
I didn't mean to offend you. But what you said was "we can't account
for the lack of warming at the moment". Now you say "we are no where
close to knowing where energy is going". In my eyes these are two 
different things -- the second relates to our level of understanding,
and I agree that this is still lacking.
Tom.
