Dear Professor Savidge, Hal Fritts's comments were, as always,
to the point and gracious. I
have much less patience with your ignorance and arrogance. The
sampling and statistical procedures involved in the production of a
cross-dated chronology are of course quite different to those used in a
randomised experiment, but they are none-the-less logical,
rigorous, science. We have been through all those arguments so many
times - you are wasting everyone's time.
John Ogden.
