Clayton,
Richard Kirshner donated $15k to attend FL232.  We are getting two felonies but we don't think they are his.   There is another Richard Kirshner linked to him as a potential relative with a different ssn and we are thinking perhaps they are his son's or father's felonies.   This guy is a practicing attorney and I doubt these are his.  Would it be possible to ask before sending him to Vet Committee?  We cannot access any additional information on these charges.
CR - $15,000 FL232
