Hillary Clinton has won the Delaware Democratic primary, according to three television networks.
Clinton had the high-profile support of both of the state's U.S. senators, Chris Coons and Tom Carper, who appeared with the former New York senator at a get-out-the-vote event Monday in Wilmington, Delaware.
Others attending that event and supporting Clinton's bid were Gov. Jack Markell and Rep. John Carney, both of whom had previously indicated that they would have backed a bid by native son Joe Biden had he decided to run.
All four men are also superdelegates who have pledged to support Clinton at the convention.
Biden and his wife Jill voted early last week, but declined to say whether they picked Clinton or Sanders.
Delaware awards its 21 pledged delegates on a proportional basis.
