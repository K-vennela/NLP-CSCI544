Crew,
We have to really keep the pressure on TeenScreen!
In the Tucson Citizen, there was an article on kids
and anti-psychotic drugs. A bunch of us wrote letters
and two were published. One of those mentioned
TeenScreen.
Then yesterday, the director of TeenScreen got a
letter of her own published in defense. Now it's good
that she's on defense. We like that. Every moment
spent on defense is a moment they won't be working to
find another kid to label and drug.
So, I need letters.
You can either write in response to David Agami's
letter and agree with him on his TeenScreen comment,
or you can respond to Leslie MacGuire's letter and
totally slam TeenScreen.
Either way, send your letter to
user@domain.com
and report compliance to me by email.
And never, ever mention Columbia University.
TeenScreen is just "TeenScreen", never "The Columbia
University TeenScreen Program", like Leslie calls it.
That is just an slimy attempt to gather more respect
that they deserve.
Make it clear to the editor which letter you are
responding to. See below for both letters.
Best,
Doyle

Mental health program helps teens
Re: the March 23 online letter ("Criminal
pharmaceuticals") questioning the validity and purpose
of the Columbia University TeenScreen program:
Much of the letter contained misinformation.
TeenScreen is a national mental health and
suicide-risk screening program that offers parents the
opportunity for their teens to receive a voluntary
mental health check-up.
Research confirms that TeenScreen is effective in
identifying youth at risk for depression, suicide and
other mental health problems.
TeenScreen does not involve diagnosis or treatment, as
the letter insinuates. I encourage anyone with
questions to visit www.teenscreen.org for complete and
accurate information.
Far too often, youth suffer mental illness in silence.
Programs such as TeenScreen provide parents and
communities an opportunity to catch these young people
before they fall.

Criminal pharmaceuticals
Re: the Friday article "Kids' anti-psych drug use
soars":
This is a lethal combination for our youth:
� Uneducated, working parents who just want to relax
a bit and trust what the "shrink" recommends for their
uncontrollable child.
� A pseudo-scientist (psychiatrist) who wants full
control, inventing "mental illnesses" that aren't
evidenced in any tissue and utilizing any brutal
method to treat them, such as lobotomy, shock
treatment or drugs with side effects such as diabetes,
high cholesterol, suicide, etc.
� Gigantic pharmaceutical companies, extraordinarily
knowledgeable in marketing techniques, with very low
morals, that hook up with these shrinks and, through
lobbying in Congress, help keep control of mental
health in the hands of these pseudo-scientists, as
long as sales of their products continue increasing
and are prescribed by the shrinks and promoted in
programs such as TeenScreen despite their harmful
effects.
� An uneducated society fed false data since Freud
and accepting these charlatans without ever seeing
bona fide results.
Semifinal result: A fivefold jump of sales of
anti-psychotic harmful drugs prescribed to our
children in the past seven years, resulting in further
strength, money and power for these criminal
pharmaceutical companies.
Final result: A fooled, drugged, controlled society in
the hands of pseudo-scientists and immoral marketeers,
a society that is decaying and whose children, whose
future, whose health and life are undermined and
endangered.
