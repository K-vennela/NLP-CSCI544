Dear James
From the Land of the Long White Cloud to the Land of the Rising Sun....
Should we not also inquire about their time line for publishing the 
comment, and on the basis that is so serious, and the implications of 
their flawed findings ask it to be expedited.
Perhaps
We also note that the paper is now being used as the basis of campaigns 
against climate change policy and, should you decide to go ahead and 
publish our comment, expedite its acceptance.
Best
Auckland James
