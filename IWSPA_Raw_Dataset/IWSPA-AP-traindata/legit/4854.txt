*Attention All National Socialists, White Activists and Patriots
**
*
NSM Ohio will conduct a book burning on *March 1*.  Stand with us as we
stand defiant against the avalanche of books defiling our race and our
culture:
- Books promoting homosexual and lesbian agendas
- Books revising, altering and destroying white history
- Books reveling in the destruction Christian morals, values and
ethics
- Books fostering myths about the treatment jews in WWII (all
holocaust propaganda)
- Books like the jewish Talmud, endorser of lies, deceit, murder and
rape of all non-jews
For too long we have tolerated politically correct, degenerate and perverted
ideas.  Too long have we watched as these ideas are put before our children
in books, on TV and in schools. Did you say "Yes" to the violence and
pornography? To the filth? To the garbage? Then stand together with us now
to say "No!" Stand up and say "Enough!"
Join us as we gather peacefully, united by our belief in the preservation of
our culture.  Join us as we publicly express our contempt for the vile
sleaze merchants.  Join us in camaraderie and friendship to fight against
the pollution of our children.
The meeting will take place March 1 at 4:00pm in Lewisburg, OH.  We will
carpool to a public awareness meeting and then on to a private location for
the book burning. Afterwards, we will go to a meeting hall for food, drink
and fellowship.

Together we can make a difference in this assault on our culture.
