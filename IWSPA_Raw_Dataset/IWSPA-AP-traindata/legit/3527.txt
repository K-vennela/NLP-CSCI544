Hey Dan,
Jordan & I just got off our conference call with Bittel and Henry and they want the vice chairs to start making calls again. I am currently about to board my connecting flight back to DC so we wanted to see if you could pull a list for us.
This list would be people who usually max every year but have not this year. The plan would be to divide them up between the vice chairs and have them make the calls this week. We have our vice chair call at 10 so we want to send them this list potentially during or right before the call.
Thanks!
Alex
