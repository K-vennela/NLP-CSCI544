Guys
here is what I understand you want from me - revised text (only up Table of Key etc) - ie
not touched refs (understand Oyvind will put them in - most are given in text)
Tim sending Table and Figure captions separately. I am sending the text with my, Fortunat's
and Ricardo's changes - with minor edits of mine added to them.
I undersatand that Oyvind will sort this ou and insert in final Chapter. I am also sendoing
my reponses to data to most of my comments (Findicates that Fortunat has answered that one
) . I will also send my edited version of Ricardo's reponses that I tweeked - ignore if
wish) . I know I have not done all comments yet but the remaining ones can be done tomorrow
I hope and any changes needed put on next draft. I do not expect many - and I was not
clearwhether Peck wanted to respond to the regional (US) precip related ones anyway?
I have added in the rather large paragraph on the tree-ring issues in response to several
comments - I know you will scream at the size  but I think we need to pu it in and then get
Ricardo's
