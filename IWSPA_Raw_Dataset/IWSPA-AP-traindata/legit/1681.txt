Dear Skalli,
The proposal that I sent you is intended as an update of the current system where the basic infrastructure, the platforms and attack vectors have been already purchased.If you need a system for a new project the price is different because I have to add all the basic modules.Would you explain me what you need?
ThanksRegardsMarco

Dear Skalli,
Sorry if I use my personal email, I have some problems to
connect with the office via VPN.
Attached to this email you can find the formal proposal; I
used your same password.
Feel free to contact me for any request on my business email
address.
Best Regards,
Marco
