Hello, everyone,
Additional info provided below.-Viva

ERSST refers only to the ocean temperature fields. Smith et al. (2008) described the
updates to create ERSST version 3.  This included the use of in situ and satellite data.
The paper also presented updates to the Land Surface Temperature (LST) product and
culminated in the computation of  the Merged Land-Ocean Surface Temperature product.
However, since ca. Nov 2008, satellite data was removed from the analysis, and was called
v3b, but the methodology is essentially the same as in the paper.  The reason was that
there was a residual cold bias in the satellite data. This caused problems for users
concerned with rankings.  We do not handle the page for the LST and Merged ST product, and
perhaps there should be more coordination among these webpages.  We have noticed the
confusion about the ERSST v3 and v3b in several articles, are in the process of updating
the webpage.
The in situ data used for the ERSSTv3b is ICOADS.  The current v3b was computed using
ICOADS release 2.4 (1784-2007).  In July 2009, a new release was made with additional data
pre-1900's and during the war years, but we have no plans yet to reprocess.  It is during
such a reprocessing that we will include any missed data.  Operationally, we run the code
on the 3rd of each month using the available GTS data.
The baseline for the ERSST anomalies is 1971-2000.  For the LST, the GHCN box averages are
provided to us as anomalies already, so I am not sure what the baseline is (I just started
3 months ago so I have not worked a lot on the Merged product codes yet). In the programs,
there is an adjustment of the LST anomaly to a 1971-2000 base.  So the final merged ST
anomaly has a 1971-2000 base period.  The best practice would be to reconstruct the
original ST by adding the 1971-2000 base.  Then compare or adjust or change baselines as
you please.
BTW, my last name is BANZON, no R.  Alas I am not related to the 261st richest person.
