Greetings and Happy New Year – 
As you probably know, last year, with the help of E&Y, we completed a study comparing our production, theatrical marketing and box office results to the industry average.  Though many of you have seen bits and pieces of the data, Dave has asked us to set a meeting to go over all of the results of the study and discuss its findings.
Alicia Yang from my office and Kristi Bartlett, Lauren’s assistant, will be in touch with your offices to set time in the coming weeks.  I just wanted to let you all know about the meeting and see if there are other participants you would like to add.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
Thanks,
-Jay
