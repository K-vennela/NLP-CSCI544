Tom,
Ben should have seen the ERA-40 Report # 18. You can forward the JGR paper.
WRT 1, it is difficult to say as it depends who's produced the values. For HadCRUT2v, I
think I've convinced the HC that the globe is (NH+SH)/2. If Peter Thorne did the
calculations
then this will be the case.
There is another issue. Sometimes the trends over Jan79-Dec03 are calculated from the
300 months rather than the 25 years. Christy does this, I think.
NCDC's Globe is probably the one domain. I've been doing some work with Russ Vose at
NCDC, which he's still to write up. Most of the differences were due to how the globe
was calculated. It is more informative to also include NH and SH as well as globe in such
tables.  I'll forward a plot Tom Peterson produced a week or two ago.
ERA-40 (2 )comparisons are discussed in the ERA-40 report # 18 and the JGR submitted
paper.
This also has comparisons by continent, which again are more informative.  There is a plot
in that work from the full globe vs the CRU coverage.  I wouldn't believe their tropics.
Also
Antarctica is way off as well - at least where the surface data are located, so I wouldn't
have much faith in their values for the unmonitored parts.
On (3)  I did some comparisons ages ago with Jim Angell's surface data from sondes. Jim's
data was just noisier and I suspect LKS would be also.  I've not done anything like this
for
ages. The closest would be the ERA-40 comparisons, which is much more extensive than
the LKS network.
I might have a chance to do an LKS comparison if Dian sends me the co-ordinates.
Comparisons over 1958-2003 will be much more realistic, but the ERA-40/NCEP degrade
prior to the 1960s. LKS would be better here. All sonde data look odd in the late 1950s to
the early 1960s. The jump around 1976/77 has always intrigued me. It is bigger in some
regions than others - I think it gets more credence because it is large over western North
America. Kevin had a paper on this in BAMS in the late 1980s.
Cheers
Phil
