Dear Keith,
I have read your text - despite of the heat wave here  (40C in my 
office in the afternoon...). I am a bit puzzled by the regional aspects. 
I think that you should make more clear in the beginning that there is 
very little new information / work conducted on the S Hemisphere / 
tropics and that most efforts have been focussed on the N Hemisphere, 
because you mention almost nothing for the S Hemisphere.  Is ENSO 
considered as a regional mode of variability? I thought that it had 
almost global relevance at least in terms of impacts.
Valrie.
