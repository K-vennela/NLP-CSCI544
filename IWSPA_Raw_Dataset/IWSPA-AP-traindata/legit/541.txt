Hi Grant,
I have been tied up with other things.  In looking at the paper some questions.
1) In Fig 1, why is the scale zero to 2?  Normally a filter would be scaled to have a
response function zero to 1.
2) In Fig 2 and 3 what are the units of "power"? It is not in the caption.  Are these
normalized spectra so that the area under the curve is unity?  My guess is that this is the
case and hence the amplification at ENSO bands.  But it is important to say this and
perhaps point out.  Maybe the captions are sufficient?   Add something like:  The spectra
have been normalized to have unit variance, which relatively inflates the values in the 0.2
to 0.5 frequency band.   In a couple of places in text add "normalized" before "power
spectrum" such as 2 lines above Fig 3 in the JGR set version.
3) A minor point: in the  x= sin(2*pi*vt) I would be inclined to add an amplitude which
would then be included also in eq (1) on RHS emphasizing how the amplitude is changed.
[My own preference would be to call the amplitude A and the A you have R (for response
function)].  However it is fine as is.
Thanks
Kevin
