ELECTION CLIPS
2016 - Presidential
Democratic Party Candidates
Hillary Clinton
WSB-TV poll: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton in a statistical tie in Georgia<<<link>>>
Here's the reason that Republicans are so worried about having Donald Trump as their presidential nominee: In Georgia, Democrat Hillary Clinton is in a statistical tie with Trump, according to a Landmark Communications/Rosetta Stone poll conducted for Channel 2 Action News. Trump leads Clinton overall, 42.3 percent to 41.4 percent - well within the 4.1 margin of error. Clinton leads Trump among independents, and the undecided Republican voters are nearly double those in the Democratic column. And the gender split is on full display: Trump leads among men, Clinton among women. FYI, Landmark and Rosetta Stone are considered Republican-oriented firms
Bernie Sanders
How Bernie Sanders has changed the Democratic Party<<<link>>>
The math is against Bernie Sanders in his fight for the White House. But the Vermont senator is poised to leave behind a durable legacy: A generation of liberal voters enthralled by his populist message -- and a Democratic Party whose ideological center has shifted left during the 2016 election. The effort now is to make sure things stay that way. Sanders has vowed to take his campaign to the Democratic convention, but he's also signaled that his effort is now more of a movement than a competitive political machine. He's slashed staff and slowed down his breakneck pace of campaigning.

Donald Trump
Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton 'enabler' attack justified<<<link>>>
Donald Trump said Monday he called Hillary Clinton an "enabler" of her husband's infidelity as "retribution" for her playing the "woman's card" against him. "It's only retribution for what she said. She is playing the woman's card to the hilt," Trump told CNN's Chris Cuomo in a testy exchange on "New Day." "She is going, I watched over the weekend, everything is about 'woman' and 'Donald Trump raised his voice.' And you know it's all nonsense. You know what? Women understand it better than anybody."
Trump accused Clinton at a recent campaign stop of attacking the women who accused Bill Clinton of harassing them.
