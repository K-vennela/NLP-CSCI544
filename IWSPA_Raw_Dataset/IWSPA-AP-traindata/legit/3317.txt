Hello Jonathan, Keith, and Eystein:
I don't yet have any word from Steve Schneider concerning the
Wahl-Ammann article on the MBH/MM issues...
...HOWEVER, here is something that slipped under my radar screen, about
which I should have made you aware previously.  I've attached the
ACCEPTED version of the Wahl-Ritson-Ammann comment article on the
vonStorch et al. 2004 Science paper.  This the article that criticizes
MBH for very large low-frequency amplitude losses.  The final acceptance
from Science just came today, and is copied below.
In this comment article (specifically requested to be expanded to 1000
words by the Science editors), we note that the calibration and
verification performance of the MBH method as implemented in VS04 show
really poor LF fidelity--which cannot happen if the MBH method is
implemented according to its original form.  We note this, which is
explained by a significant omission on the part of VS04 in implementing
the MBH methodology (a detrending step that was only disclosed later
last year in a conference proceedings paper).  We also comment on
physical and statistical reasons why detrending is not appropriate in
this context.  We conclude that the large amplitude losses VS04 claims
are simply not correct.
I am imagining that this contextualization of the VS04 critique would
also be relevant for your chapter, and it can now be considered "in
press" as the from our Science correspondent notes below.  I would think
this acceptance makes it "citable".  If not, I understand.
NOTE THAT THIS ARTICLE IS SUBJECT TO THE USUAL SCIENCE EMBARGO RULES.  I
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS MEANS CITATION IS EMBARGOED.  (Cf. 4th
paragraph in copied message below that supports citation.)
Peace, Gene
