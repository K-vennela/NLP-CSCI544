Ok, and a couple of follow ups from McClatchy:
They had this number for the 2012 OVF:
$456,024,034
While in your responses earlier you gave:
Obama Victory 2012: $452,851,099
Which one should we use?
And for the Sanders Victory Fund, how many state parties signed onto it? Is it the same 32 or 33 or HVF?
