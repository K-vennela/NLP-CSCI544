Hi all, I assume this is general interest, not IDAG meeting - I think the
meeting would be a bit too big and complicated if we would try to resolve
IPCC type issues - on the other hand, involving Chris Field and maybe  
Tom Stocker may be an interesting way to vent the scientific issues in  
a relaxed setting. But I would suggest to avoid agency type things -  
can be convinced otherwise if you feel strongly. we do have a limited  
budget, too!
