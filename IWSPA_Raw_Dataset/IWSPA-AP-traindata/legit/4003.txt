Thanks, Phil.  Here is a way that Reto likes to list the rankings that come out of our
version of land-ocean index.
rank          LOTI
1  2005    0.62C
2  1998    0.57C
2007    0.57C
2002     0.56C
2003    0.55C
2006    0.54C
7  2004    0.49C
i.e., the second through sixth are in a statistical tie for second in our analysis.  This
seems useful, and most reporters are sort of willing to accept it.  Given differences in
treating the Arctic etc., there will be substantial differences in rankings.  I would be a
bit surprised is #7 (2004) jumpred ahead to be #2 in someone else's analysis, but perhaps
even that is possible, given the magnitude of these differences.
