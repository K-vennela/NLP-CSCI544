Mike,
Checked with Keith and Tim.  The abstract is like one we would write - leaves all
options
open as to what will be presented.  At least AGU and EGS don't charge to get abstracts
printed. AMS have so many missing now with their charges that the book of abstracts is
ridiculous.  Fine for all three of us to be there and we look forward to seeing some
results
in the autumn. This will be when the real action begins.
The CCDD meeting in early Nov. might be at a good time to discuss some results.
Add an 'of'  between choice and actual on the third line.
Cheers
Phil
