Los Angeles Times | April 20, 2014 | 11:16 AM
"Captain America: Winter Soldier" fended off its competition at the box office, holding onto the No. 1 spot for the third week in a row by drawing in $26.6 million. 20th Century Fox's animated family favorite "Rio 2" pulled in a solid $22.5 million for second, while Sony TriStar's "Heaven is for Real" opened at No. 3 with $21.5 million. The only story of disappointment came from Warner Bros.' sci-fi thriller "Transcendence," which stars Johnny Depp and took in a meager $11.2 million.
