Open Letter to Members of the Party:
NSM Party Comrades, I am addressing this publicly, but it is directed at active Party members. When I first joined the NSM I knew it would be something I would stick with the rest of my life. It was not a club, a gang, or some fleeting thrill for the moment: it was a commitment to a way of life, and a direct link to many of our Forefathers who fought for Blood and Soil.
It has recently come to my attention that certain former and current National Socialists are actively working for the enemy. We have compiled a list of former NSM members: this list is to be kept absolutely confidential!  All Current National Socialist Movement members are under direct orders to have no association with the oath breakers and race-traitors on the following list:
