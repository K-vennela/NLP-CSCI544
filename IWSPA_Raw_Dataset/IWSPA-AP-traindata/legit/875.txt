Practical Guidance for Measuring the Impact &
Success of Your Volunteer Program
Step-by-step guidance through developing=20
practical methods to measure your volunteers' impact.
=20
Volunteers are a critical part of nonprofit organizations. Effective nonpro=
fits are good at leveraging their volunteers' enthusiasm and skills to bene=
fit their mission. But, not all organizations know how to measure the impac=
t of these contributions. This begins with developing and implementing a se=
t of metrics for measuring the true contribution of your volunteers. While =
most nonprofits know how many active volunteers they have and the number of=
hours they work, these basic metrics do not tell the whole story of how vo=
lunteers positively affect the mission or the clients, and if changes in ho=
w you manage your volunteers are worth considering.
=20
Accurate and up-to-date metrics about your volunteer program demonstrate yo=
ur accountability and value to your clients, your community, your stakehold=
ers, and your funding sources. But, designing a systematic evaluation proce=
ss, collecting data, and understanding the outcomes, while essential, doesn=
't have to be daunting.
=20
Please join Lynn Ivey, nonprofit consultant, as she explores practical and =
adaptable metrics to measure the impact of your volunteers and the success =
of your volunteer program. Volunteer metrics are an important tool that enh=
ances your credibility and provides key information for decision-making and=
strategic planning -- see how to make it work for you.
