Hi Tim, Keith and Stefan - We certainly can't get into the details of 
the debate, both for space reasons, and because K & T have gotten us 
away from the more "defensive" impression our FOD gave reviewers and 
others. Although I share Stefan's concern that we almost have to 
hammer the misinformation to death, I think we'll be ok dealing with 
it succinctly, and focusing on the bigger picture - Mann et al., and 
all the controversy is history - we know much more now, and it makes 
for stronger statements. Keith and Tim have done a nice job balancing 
all this, and we have to hope that all the Mann et al controversy 
will start sounding as dated as it is. I know I make that point 
pretty clearly when I talk to the media.
BUT, I leave it to Keith and Tim to tweak the discussion to reflect 
Stafan's concern as appropriate.
thanks, Peck
