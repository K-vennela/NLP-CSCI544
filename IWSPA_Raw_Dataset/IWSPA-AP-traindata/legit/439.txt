Hi,
if what Tom writes is correct, then I  would 
think it is not necessary to have a separate 
paper. But we need to be sure so as not to break 
any of the regulations since this will be one of 
the most scrutinized sections of the whole 4AR. I 
guess it is now up to how Keith and Tim takes the 
MWP box further and what ends up in the figure.
Cheers,
Eystein
