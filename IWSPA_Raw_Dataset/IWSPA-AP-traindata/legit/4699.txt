Hi Eystein, Keith and Fortunat - this is a special request for help from the Euro team,
so I know I have solid feedback by the time I get to work tomorrow am. Please respond
asap (using track changes if you can).
1) Tomorrow I have to send the TSU our Robust Findings and Key Uncertainties Table. I
have attached this table. Please edit, and if you think a Finding or Uncertainty is
missing, please suggest exactly how you think it should be worded, and, if it is a
Finding, suggest which existing one it should replace (I suspect they don't want more,
but we could try). Please keep in mind this table will be part of the TS (not our
chapter), and they must be VERY policy relevant - this is not the place for things a
policy maker would not understand. Also, we need to use plainer English than in our Exec
Summary bullets.
2) I also attach the latest Exec Summary, with the latest from Keith and Fortunat (e.g.,
reordered as you suggested). I will send this in to the TSU tomorrow too, so if you want
to read and edit (PLEASE USE TRACK CHANGES), that'll help too, but this is less
important than working on the Robust/Key table.
Many thanks! Cheers, peck
