Total War and Special Guest Band from Minnesota to play Omaha after Party:
It is confirmed, after the Sept. 1st Rally in Omaha at the Mexican Consulate, the live bands will be Total War from Michigan, and a special guest band from right here in the Great White Northlands of Minnesota. The music starts sometime after the BBQ, and after dark will be the double swastika lighting. This is an Outdoors show, and camping is available so people can stay over Saturday night. 
This is going to be a great event, make sure to plan for the Rally, we will be handing out maps afterwards for directions to the private property where the show is being held. Anyone in poor health, children, or women that do not wish to attend the Rally for safety reasons are welcome to contact us to make seperate arrangements so you don't miss out on the music, food, and festivities. This is a Family event, and all White Patriots are welcome to attend with us in Solidarity.
