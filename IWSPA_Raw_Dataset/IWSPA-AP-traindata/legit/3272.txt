State Parties--
With less than 2 weeks until we gather in Philadelphia for our final site visit, I hope that you've made plans to attend and have a final in-person meeting with both the Convention team and your delegation hotel.
Join us for this week's Train to Win webinar,
Philadelphia Meeting and Walk Through Prep (<<link>>) . The DNCC team will discuss what you need to know for the week, including a breakdown of the schedule and logistics and how you can make the most of your time on the ground. Please register using the link below.
*Even if you do not plan to be in Philadelphia for the meeting, we encourage you to attend this webinar to get the latest Convention-related updates*
