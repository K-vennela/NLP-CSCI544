Hi all
Well I have my own article on where the heck is global warming?  We are asking that here in
Boulder where we have broken records the past two days for the coldest days on record.  We
had 4 inches of snow.  The high the last 2 days was below 30F and the normal is 69F, and it
smashed the previous records for these days by 10F.  The low was about 18F and also a
record low, well below the previous record low.  This is January weather (see the Rockies
baseball playoff game was canceled on saturday and then played last night in below freezing
weather).

The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a
travesty that we can't.  The CERES data published in the August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008
shows there should be even more warming: but the data are surely wrong.  Our observing
system is inadequate.
That said there is a LOT of nonsense about the PDO.  People like CPC are tracking PDO on a
monthly basis but it is highly correlated with ENSO.  Most of what they are seeing is the
change in ENSO not real PDO.  It surely isn't decadal.  The PDO is already reversing with
the switch to El Nino.  The PDO index became positive in September for first time since
Sept 2007.   see
