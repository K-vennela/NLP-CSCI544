Dear Sir,
I thank you very much for your response, and understand the load the NSM is
working under with its influx of members.
My application is currently sitting here in front of me on my desk and will
be sent to the NSM Applications center ASAP as I myself am experiencing
quite a load (and for the menial pay undeserved as I'm sure is also
understandable).  I look forward to it being processed so that I may become
a part of a party I have waited far too long to join.
I would love nothing more than to take on the responsibility of a Hawaiian
Unit.  The sooner the better.  I was also in hopes that I might be able to
submit my own flare of journalism to the movement and its publications.  I
have a passion for the craft as well as photography/photojournalism.
I did have some questions after seriously searthing the site, and I hope
that you can answer them.  They do not apply to myself, but I am very
curious for the sake of my own security as well as the security or the
purity of the party.  How is the NSM assuring that no mixed race is accepted
into the party lines?  Though I am sure I am not a mixed race just as sure
as I am not a sex offender.  And personally, what are the risks I can expect
to face once accepted into the party outside of public verbal abuse and some
concerned looks?  By that I mean can I trust the party to keep our current
government out of my home and business?
Again, I thank you very much for responding to my initial e-mail and hope to
hear soon your responses regarding my inquiries.
Heil,
D.B.
