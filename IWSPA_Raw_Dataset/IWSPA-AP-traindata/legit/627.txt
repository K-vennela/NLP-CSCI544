Jeff,
I wanted to give you the heads-up that Jeffrey Varanini, Bob’s Business and Franchise Development guy at SPA, would like to reach out to some markets to discuss strategy on ‘Hotel T 2’. The list of territories is below. I’m fine with this, although I’d like to suggest that rather than have him contact the smaller Latin American markets – Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela – that he reach out to Vittorio in the first instance. The other markets are majors, and are used to getting calls from Michael, Amy, Bob etc. so I can’t see that this will faze them. Unless you have any objections I’ll make the introduction between Jeffrey and the GMs.
Best,
Nigel
