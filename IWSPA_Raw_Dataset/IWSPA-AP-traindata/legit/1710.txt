*MOUNT CLEMENS --* The Mount Clemens mayor plans to organize a summit to
address youth violence in the wake of two recent incidents involving teens.
"We need to take a proactive stance in the community," Mayor Barb Dempsey
said Tuesday. "We need to come up with a way to rectify these issues."
Last month, 25 graduating seniors allegedly vandalized Mount Clemens High
School, and in a separate incident, a mob of 20 to 30 men was said to have
assaulted three victims in separate locations in the city, seriously
injuring one.

Five suspects have been charged in connection with the attacks on three
people in Mount Clemens.
Though specific details have not been set, Dempsey said the meeting will
take place shortly after the Fourth of July. It may replace a previously
scheduled town hall meeting on crime that was tentatively planned for July
15.
She added that the meeting is likely to be scheduled at the newly built
Cairns Community Center.
"I don't know what to expect of the meeting," Dempsey added, "but I'm hoping
that we can stand together strong and come up with something that won't cost
an arm and a leg."
Community leaders applaud the plan.
"It's an excellent idea," said Greg Murray, president of the Mount Clemens
Community School District Board of Education.
"But I hope action comes out of it. People get together and make statements,
and there's no action. I want there to be something tangible coming out of
it."
A total of nearly 40 clergy members, school board members, community
activists and law enforcement officials can expect to receive letters about
the proposed meeting, said Dempsey, adding that the letters will be
completed by Friday.
The meeting will be open to the public. A separate meeting with business and
bar owners and downtown officials will be held later to discuss related
issues.
The mob attack continues to generate controversy in Macomb County.
County Sheriff's officials said several people were ticketed Tuesday for
distributing fliers in the area, citing the attacks.
*The fliers, which also listed an address and Web site for the National
Socialist Movement, said in part: "This sort of savagery must not be
tolerated! We must reclaim our neighborhoods ... we must fight back before
things get even worse! White men and women must stand together against gang
violence."*
