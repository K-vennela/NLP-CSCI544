Dear all,
Please find attached the Bern2.5CC model output for the IPCC-AR4 
millenium simulations, all spanning the period from 1000 - 1998AD. Some 
plots including a preliminary comparison between CLIMBER-2 and Bern2.5CC 
results are additionally included (see infos below).
1. The following Bern2.5CC files are attached (with the simulation tag 
as specified in Fortunat's readme document):
Simulation B1.1:  Bern2.5CC_bard08_volcCrow_CO2_nonCO2_1000-1998_ar4.dat
Simulation B1.2:  Bern2.5CC_bard25_volcCrow_CO2_nonCO2_1000-1998_ar4.dat
Simulation B2   :  Bern2.5CC_WLS-2005_volcCrow_CO2_nonCO2_1000-1998_ar4.dat
Simulation B3.1:  Bern2.5CC_bard08_volcCrow_CO2_anthr0_1000-1998_ar4.dat
Simulation B3.2:  Bern2.5CC_bard25_volcCrow_CO2_anthr0_1000-1998_ar4.dat
Simulation B3.3:  Bern2.5CC_WLS-2005_volcCrow_CO2_anthr0_1000-1998_ar4.dat
Simulation B4   :  Bern2.5CC_ctrl_1000-1998_ar4.dat
The variables stored are: year AD, globally averaged surface air 
temperature, and northern hemispheric and southern hemispheric surface 
air temperature. The most important information about model setup and 
references is included in the extended header in each file. Please note 
that the information on the forcing timeseries applied are specified in 
the filename only!
Please let me know if something is unclear or if you want additional 
informations about these simulations in particular or the Bern2.5CC 
model in general. I can also provide more output variables if desired 
(such as e.g. MOC, Sea level, ...).
2. In addition, the following plots with CLIMBER-2 and Bern2.5CC results 
are attached:
Dgmairtnorm_millenium_Bern2.5CC-CLIMBER2_1000_1998_ipccar4.eps
Dgmairtnorm_millenium_Bern2.5CC-CLIMBER2_offset0.8_1000_1998_ipccar4.eps
Dgmairtnorm_millenium_Bern2.5CC_1000_1998_ipccar4.eps
Dgmairtnorm_millenium_CLIMBER2_1000_1998_ipccar4.eps
All these plots show the anomaly in global mean surface air temperature 
with respect to the value in year 1001AD from either CLIMBER-2, 
Bern2.5CC, or both. Let me know if you have questions or comments about 
the plots.
With best regards,
Gian-Kasper
