Leaving aside for the moment the resolution issue, the statement should at least be
consistent with our figures. Fig. 6-10 looks like there were years around 1000 AD that
could have been just as warm  - if one wants to make this statement, one needs to expand
the vertical scale in Fig. 6-10 to show that the current warm period is 'warmer'.
Now getting back to the resolution issue: given what we know about the ability to
reconstruct global or NH temperatures in the past - could we really in good conscience say
we have the precision from tree rings and the very sparse other data to make any definitive
statement of this nature (let alone accuracy)? While I appreciate the cleverness of the
second sentence, the problem is everybody will recognize that we are 'being clever' - at
what point does one come out looking aggressively defensive?
I agree that leaving the first sentence as the only sentence suggests that one is somehow
doubting the significance of the recent warm years, which is probably not something we want
to do. What I would suggest is to forget about making 'one year' assessments; what Fig.
6-10 shows is that the recent warm period is highly anomalous with respect to the record of
the last 1000 years. That would be what I think we can safely conclude the last 1000 years
really tells us.
