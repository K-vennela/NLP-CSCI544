Good Saturday morning. Enjoy the dinner, and the last day of April.
ZEITGEIST - "GOP's Stop-Trump fever breaks: But a small core of Never-Trump operatives is still plotting a contested convention," by Kyle Cheney and Ben Schreckinger: "[P]ro-Cruz and anti-Trump forces are running out of options to prevent Trump from becoming the nominee. If the real estate developer and reality television star scores a big win in Indiana on Tuesday, Cruz's only remaining strategy may be a hostile takeover of the Republican National Convention - a move GOP insiders still see as possible but certainly one that could severely damage the party." <<link>>
JUICY READ - "Donald Trump, Jos&eacute; Andr&eacute;s and the death of a grand Washington restaurant," by WashPost's Jonathan O'Connell: "He called it Topo Atrio, his vision for a sumptuous hotel restaurant befitting a $200 million makeover of the Old Post Office Pavilion on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. Jos&eacute; Andr&eacute;s designed a 212-seat, 9,000-square-foot dining room clad in travertine limestone and trimmed in gold. Costing nearly $7 million to build, it would feature hand-carved cured ham from the black-footed Iberico pigs of his native Spain and squid ink pasta with head-on red shrimp, cuttlefish and aioli. 
"But as Andr&eacute;s prepared to present his final plans ... [Trump] took the stage at Trump Tower in New York to announce his candidacy for president and, in the process, railed against Mexican immigrants as drug dealers and rapists. ... [Now] the two are suing each other, filling a court file with affidavits and correspondence chronicling what has become a stubborn standoff between two powerful personalities." <<link>> 
TRUMP'S AMERICA -- L.A. Times 4-col. lead (under riot pic), "Trump spurs a fresh wave of Latino activism," by Cindy Carcamo, Ruben Vives and Corina Knoll: "Protest organizers in Southern California said the anti-Trump demonstration spread through word of mouth and involved mostly young people, including many high school and college students. They brought with them Mexican flags, which were once discouraged at immigrant rights rallies for fear they would be regarded as un-American. ... 
"But in reaction to Trump, the Mexican flag has re-emerged, unfurled and unapologetic and a symbol for a new generation of Latino activists. Protesters said they have no hesitation about putting their heritage on display, especially when it comes to the rise and rhetoric of Donald Trump." <<link>>
