Kevin,
I was concerned about splitting too, and suggested as a way of getting
through the work a little quicker. Pairs will also work as long as we choose
the right ones. Agree we need to separate the major from minor, so
anything that can be done there in April will be good.
I suspect the comments from the nominated reviewers will all have
to answered in a formal way - as a dry run for the FOD and SOD.
On the figures we need to compare notes on these in a few weeks
and assign particular people to them. We both worked with Dave
on the set of trends. They may not be perfect, but they are better
than some of the others. I think we will need to do more of this.
Giving responsibility for a handful to some of the LAs is a
possibility. We'll need to give clear instructions though and expect
loads of iterations. I can deal with 3.2 with David and the HC if we
can agree on what and how we want them.  Most of the other
sections require much more thought. I'll work on this.
I agree 100% with you on the TC section. This will get scrutinized
by many more now. I'll report back on the CCSP review. Apart
from Lindzen the panel seem pretty good. So, I'll gauge what the
key issues appear to be in the panel's minds. Agree that we
shouldn't treat it's conclusions as gospel (otherwise why are we
bothering), but treat it as a very very major review article.
Must go home now. Have a good trip back to NZ.
Cheers
Phil
