Dear Melissa,
No, this would not be dire. What is dire is Douglass et al.'s willful 
neglect of any observational datasets that do not support their 
arguments. Recall that our 2005 Science paper presented information from 
all observational datasets available to us at that time, even from 
datasets that showed large differences relative to the model data. We 
did not present results from RSS alone.
With best regards,
Ben
