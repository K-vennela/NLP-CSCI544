You have a go from me.  By all means clean up.  I think you should argue
that it should be expedited for the reasons of interest by the press.  Key
question is who was the editor who handled the original, because this is
an implicit criticism of that person.  May need to point this out and
ensure that someone else handles it.
Thanks
