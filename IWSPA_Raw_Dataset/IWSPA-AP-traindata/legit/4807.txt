Dear friends and colleagues
This will be the last from me for the moment and I believe we are all 
arriving at a consensus voiced by Tom, Barrie, Neville et al., from 
excellent discussions.  
Firstly both Danny and Tom have complained to de Freitas about 
his editorial decision, which does not uphold the principles of good 
science.  Tom has shared the response. I would be curious to find 
out who the other four cited are - but a rebuttal would be excellent.
Ignoring bad science eventually reinforces the apparent 'truth' of 
that bad science in the public mind, if it is not corrected.  As 
importantly, the 'bad science' published by CR is used by the 
sceptics' lobbies to 'prove' that there is no need for concern over 
climate change.  Since the IPCC makes it quite clear that there are 
substantial grounds for concern about climate change,  is it not 
partially the responsibility of climate science to make sure only 
satisfactorily peer-reviewed science appears in scientific 
publications?  - and to refute any inadequately reviewed and wrong 
articles that do make their way through the peer review process?
I can understand the weariness which the ongoing sceptics' 
onslaught would induce in anyone, scientist or not.  But that's no 
excuse for ignoring bad science.  It won't go away, and the more 
we ignore it the more traction it will gain in the minds of the general 
public, and the UNFCCC negotiators.  If science doesn't uphold the 
purity of science, who will?
We Australasians (including Tom as an ex pat) have suggested 
some courses of action.  Over to you now in the north to assess 
the success of your initiatives, the various discussions and 
suggestions and arrive on a path ahead.  I am happy to be part of it.
Warm wishes to all
Jim
