EXCLUSIVE: MITCH McCONNELL in his forthcoming book, "The Long Game: A Memoir," out May 31, re Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid: "Harry is rhetorically challenged. If a scalpel will work, he picks up a meat ax. He also has a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde personality. In person, Harry is thoughtful, friendly, and funny. But as soon as the cameras turn on or he's offered a microphone, he becomes bombastic and unreasonable, spouting things that are both nasty and often untrue, forcing him to then later apologize. 
"For example, [in 2005] he'd called then-Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan a political hack and later decided to enlighten a group of sixty students by calling President Bush a loser during a speaking engagement at their high school. This lack of restraint goes against what is expected from a party leader, and I was skeptical, at best, about the direction of the Senate under his leadership."
