Dear Lisa,
That's great news! I've confirmed with DOE that I can use up to $10,000 
of my DOE Fellowship to provide financial support for Tom's Symposium. I 
will check with Anjuli Bamzai at DOE to determine whether there are any 
strings attached to this money. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to use 
the DOE money for the Symposium dinner, and to defray some of the travel 
expenses of international participants who can't come up with their own 
travel money. I'll try to resolve this question in the next few days.
Best wishes to you and your family for a very Merry Christmas, and a 
happy, healthy, and peaceful 2009!
Ben
