Leah and Bob: After Bob sent to Pollack the revised proposal set forth below, I received a call late this afternoon from Ben Singer, one of Pollack’s attorneys. The response was not good. Ben made the following points:
1. The holdback of 50% is ridiculously too high. They would want 85% upon signing of a short form. (I told him that if so, the short form would not be so short).
2. They will never agree to a time limit on the agreement – the deal with Mark would not end until the IGT deal finally ends. THIS IS THE BIG ONE.
3. On 6A(1), they want 20% until December 31, 2029. (I think that if SPT agreed to no termination date, they would agree to 20% until December 31, 2024).
4. On 6A(2), the 10% continues until the IGT deal finally ends.
5. On 6A(3), the 10% continues until the IGT deal finally ends.
6. 6A(4) would be deleted.
7. On 6B, they want to be sure that the indemnity provisions survive, that Pollack retains audit rights and the right to secure copies of records relevant to conducting an audit. They are confused as to 6B(3), and would want to discuss the length of such an agreement and what provisions would survive. If SPT/SPCP is free to use Pollack or not, they do not understand why any end date is needed.
So, in the event SPT accepted such a deal, what would SPT have achieved? 
1. Paid 7 of the 14 million as a compromise.
2. When the 2024 deal ends, reduce Pollack’s deal on gambling monies to 10%.
3. Reduce non-gambling monies to 10% now and going forward.
4. Limit the deal to WOF and Jeopardy! and no other properties.
5. Pollack to consult only upon SPT request – non audit related records not sent to Pollack. Confidentiality obligation imposed.
I have asked our outside counsel to revisit the issue of whether SPT can legally terminate the deal at the end of 2024 and to revert to me this weekend. I want to better understand our chances – although any decision would be by an arbitrator, not in court.
