To be clear, this reduction was due to the fact that the numbers were still strong enough at $195M IBO to make this greenlight make sense so Osher and all in the greenlight meeting decided we should reduce it for greenlight purposes.  This wasn’t based on anyone feeling less optimistic about the prospects.  Thanks.
