Hello Bill,
I am sorry to bother you again. But, I was wondering if you can help me.
=)
I am still doing that paper for my Mythology class.
But I was told that Baldur ( idk how to spell it) is more "christ like"
and I was hoping that you can help me.
I have to have a 5000 word paper wrote to answer this question.
Compare at least TWO different mythical heroes, one from each culture of
your own choice.
(A) Identify similarites and differences in the personalities and
adventures of your
respective heroes.
(B) Try to account for these similarities and differences.
If you can't do it, thats ok. If you can..=)
Jeff and I will buy your dinner after the March in D.C.
Thank You
Joanna Schoep
