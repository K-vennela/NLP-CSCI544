FYI.....
On 3rd Street unit.  Lol!
It sounds like you've gathered all the docs- after I receive them from David ill let you know if there's anything I need.
I'm looking forward to working with you guy in helping to lock down the apartment for the girls! It's a great unit and they will be the first ever tenants to live there post-renovations, which is an unbelievable rarity in the Village! I know they will be happy there. 
Thanks for getting in touch! If you have any questions throughout this process please feel free to call me at 917-993-4006.
