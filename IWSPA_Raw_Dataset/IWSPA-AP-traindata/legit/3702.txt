It's time for Episode 3 of the "2016 Nerdcast," POLITICO's new podcast on the race for the White House. Tune in each week to geek out with us as we dive deep into this amazing presidential race, the latest numbers that actually matter, plus backstage dope on how politics really works. We're the kind of folks who like to spend our Friday nights poring over poll numbers or the latest Federal Election Commission reports - so if you want to understand how the modern politics game is played, this is the podcast for you.

In this week's episode, national editor Kristin Roberts, senior investigative reporter Ken Vogel, media reporter Hadas Gold, senior politics editor Charlie Mahtesian, and campaigns editor Scott Bland discuss the mounting anger among Bernie Sanders' supporters, and whether that will hurt Hillary Clinton in the general election. Also, Facebook has an optics problem with conservative voters -- did Mark Zuckerberg smooth things over with the GOP this week? Plus: How will the enormous gender gap between Clinton and Donald Trump drive campaign strategy for the next six months?
