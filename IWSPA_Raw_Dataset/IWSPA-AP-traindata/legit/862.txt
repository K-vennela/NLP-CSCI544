Crew,
This petition is really going like gangbusters! Almost
6000 names and growing, in just over two weeks!
We have to keep that momentum going.
Send this link to everyone you know:
<<link>>
Tell them all to sign it and pass it on! Thank them
for signing it if they already have.
Yes, I know you've done it before but I promise you
that many of them have not signed it yet.
This petition will be a huge tool in the war for human
rights if we keep growing those numbers!
Also, find some new addresses to send this to. You
must have some other friends, relatives, co-workers or
acquaintences who you haven't communicated with
lately.
Get onto a local "forum" or "message board" in your
area and post the petition. Here's how you do that: Go
to www.yahoo.com and search for FORUM and YOUR TOWN. I
searched FORUM and POUGHKEEPSIE and got this
<<link>> just
to show you an example. Sign up as a member and start
a new topic about "Parental rights" or "Stop mental
health screening" and tell your neighbors about the
petition. Take a look at whether there have been
postings on the board recently. If no one has written
anything on it in a month, move on and find a better
one.
If you're in the San Franscisco area, I would like you
to get on this message board, if you can:
<<link>>
It may only be for alumni of Columbia University, not
sure if you can get on it.
And report compliance by email.
Much love,
Doyle
