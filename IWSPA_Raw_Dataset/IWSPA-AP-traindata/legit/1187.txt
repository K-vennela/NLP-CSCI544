We can't let this go by unchallenged.
The psychs are making another fraudulent pitch to turn
more veterans into lifelong drug addicts and mental
patients.
Your assignment:
1. Read, or skim over, the USA Today article.

Write what you want, but I have a suggestion:
If your last name begins with J-M or T-Z, I want you
to point out the fact that the American Psychiatric
Association is promoting this to gain more money for
its members, not to help the soldiers. It may be true
that soldiers who experience that list of symptoms
fraudulently promoted as disease have a tendency to
have physical ailments too. The psychs are promoting,
with no evidence, that the physical symptoms are
caused by the PTSD. In reality though, it could be
that the physical pain and distress is causing the
PTSD symptoms. Psychs do not want that truth promoted
because the veterans would seek competent medical care
rather than psych treatments, which just cover up and
never cure.
3. Report compliance by email.
Thanks,
