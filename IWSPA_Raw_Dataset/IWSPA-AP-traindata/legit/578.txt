You have answered my concerns very well.  Thank you.
My two biggest worries were the infiltration of the filth into the party.
But I can see your point.  It would be foolish and almost ridiculous to the
point of water-headed idiocy for someone outside the aryan race to attempt
joining the ranks of the NSM.  I do hope, however, that in the future the
party will have the funds to do some further background checks in respect to
bloodlines to further weed out those that shouldn't be making the cut to
being with.
The government worry was one of my bigger concerns after talking to the same
jack asses that were keeping me from joining the party for so long.  Which
is ironic really--they claim the Nazi party employs fear to keep its members
in line, when really it was those not belonging to the party who were
untilizing fear to keep me from jumping the proverbial fence.  I had heard
often of federal retribution for our position and political beliefs.  Phone
tappings, FBI files, and under the ever constant watch of the feds.  Not
that I'm too worried about this--I have nothing to hide and have done
nothing wrong--I just like my life simple and direct without too much
looming behind the curtains unless i put it there.
Thank you once more.
