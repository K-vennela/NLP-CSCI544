Comrades,
We are pleased to announce the new contact point for NSM Chicago. The
Chicago chapter has been a long active NSM base, but due to the unit Leader
being on leave for personal/family reasons the local chapter has not been
somewhat dormant. NSM Chicago is now back to active duty organizing and are
building the local ranks.
To contact NSM Chicago:  user@domain.com   We urge all local Illinois
and Chicago area Patriots to get active and assist in building your local
NSM.
