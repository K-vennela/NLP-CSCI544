Hi Tom,
I'm not sure what format to try if ASCII doesn't work for you.  I've attached the same ones
again, in case it was just some random reason that corrupted the files.  If this doesn't
work, then please suggest a format I should try.
The name I have is Yamal not Yarnal.  Yamal is coastwards (northward) of the "Polar Urals"
and is at a lower elevation than the Polar Urals record.  The latitude/longitude I have for
it is:
67.5 N, 70 E
Hope that helps
Tim
