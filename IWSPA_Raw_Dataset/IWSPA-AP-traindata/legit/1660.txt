Dear Phil et al,
I agree on Mike Evans. I'm afraid I don't agree on Zorita. He has engaged in some very
nasty, and in my opinion unprofessional email exchanges with some close colleagues of mine
who have established some fundamental undisclosed errors in work he co-published with von
Storch.  Given this, I don't believe he can be involved in constructive dialogue of the
sort we're looking for at this workshop. There are some similarly problematic issues w/
Cubasch, who like von Storch, who has engaged in inflammatory and ad hominem public
commentary. There is no room for that on any side of the debate.
If the Germans need to be represented here, I would suggest instead someone from the
Potsdam group, such as Eva Bauer, who has been doing some very interesting work on
modelling the climate of the past 2K,
mike
