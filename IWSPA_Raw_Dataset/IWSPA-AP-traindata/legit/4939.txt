Hi Tim - it is a wonderful figure, and we are 
writing about a paper's worth about it - very 
condensed stuff, but loaded with impact.
Let's see what Keith and Eystein suggest, but I'm 
happy w/ the fig and ref period you've used. 
Would rather have you working on more award 
winning figs than updating this one. Can do that 
later depending on feedback the SOD gets.
Well done, thx, peck
