Attached is a discussion document. It incorporates material provided by
Simon Shackley (UMIST) & Mike Hulme. Jean has commented on it. It is
intended to circulate this to consortium partners on Monday. if you have
chance to read it & comment on it before it goes, that would be good; but I
recognise that - in practice - time is too short. My apologies for that.
(However, I do think there is a danger in presenting our partners with too
'final' a draft application at this stage. And we do need their bright
ideas!).
CHRIS - please will you liaise with Jean to:
1. Get this document out to outside attendees.
2. Send out a list of attendees
3. Give outside people details of where to get the Research Councils'
document 'Information for applicants to run the Centre' (web), if they
don't already have it.
4. Send out an agenda (Jean is doing this)
5. Send out Kerry's diagram (Jean has)
CHRIS  - will you also please fax copies of the ICER document (in your
tray) to John Shepherd (Southampton 596258) and Nigel Arnell (I don't have
fax number). [For info to others - we didn't send Soton a copy of the ICER
bid earlier, because they were sitting on the fence].
Very many thanks. 
Trevor
