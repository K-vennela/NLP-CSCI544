Dear Ed - Didn't Keith Briffa also come up with a more marked LIA 
than MBH99 in his age-band work? If this turns out to be right, it 
should eventually be easier to find the sources of the differences 
between the reconstructions, just by virtue of there being not only 
many more tree-ring data for that period, but also more other, data, 
such as documentary. Cheers, Malcolm
