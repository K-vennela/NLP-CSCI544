Claire,
Jordan forgot to include us in the delinquents, but I think that's because
he assumed I sent these yesterday. In fairness, I meant to actually, but
here they are. Sorry about that.
Let us know if we need to send a spreadsheet with contacts for them, but
all these folks are pretty well known donors to women's groups/causes.
Thanks,
Michael
