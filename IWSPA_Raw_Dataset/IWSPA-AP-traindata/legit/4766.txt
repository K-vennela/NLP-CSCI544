folks, I was thinking exactly the same thing. the problems are so unusually fundamental and
obvious, as we lay them out, that it does immediately call into suspicion the integrity of
the review process.
We probably need to take this directly to the chief editor at JGR, asking that this not be
handled by the editor who presided over the original paper, as this would represent a
conflict of interest. if we are told that is not possible, then we would at least want the
chief editor himself to closely monitor the handling of the paper.
I too am happy to sign of at this point,
mike
