Phil,
I can't quite see what all the fuss is about Watson - why should he be re-nominated
anyway?  Why should not an Indian scientist chair IPCC?  One could argue the CC issue is
more important for the South than for the North.  Watson has perhaps thrown his weight
about too much in the past.  The science is well covered by Susan Solomon in WGI, so why
not get an engineer/economist since many of the issues now raised by CC are more to do with
energy and money, than natural science.
If the issue is that Exxon have lobbied and pressured Bush, then OK, this is regrettable
but to be honest is anyone really surprised?  All these decisions about IPCC chairs and
co-chairs are deeply political (witness DEFRA's support of Martin Parry for getting the
WGII nomination).
