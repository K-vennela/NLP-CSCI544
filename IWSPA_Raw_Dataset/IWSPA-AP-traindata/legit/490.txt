Party Comrades,
Today is a good day for all of us in the National Socialist Movement. We
have purged our Ranks of defeatism, the disloyal, and the half hearted. The
Party is once again an Iron Fist, bound and determined to see the fight
through to the end. One could say that we are filling old holes with cement,
solidifying our base, and moving forward.
As of today, Oct. 20th, we are promoting 2 Leaders into the National
Office, Master Sgt. Johnson of NSM Radio to Director of NSM Media and
Audio/Video Dept. his assistants will include Shawn Hughes of NSM AZ, and
Cpl. Randy B. of NSM WI. New Contact for NSM Audio/Video Dept. is as
follows: user@domain.com
The new Leader of the NSM Viking Youth will be Sgt. Christina Drake:
Contact: user@domain.com
Both of the above Leaders have proven themselves to be committed Party
members and have served our Party with Honor and Integrity. Join me in
welcoming them to their new posts in our Party.
While we have seen some weak people falter, and in some cases running
directly into the enemy camp, be it the ADL, or a fake NS group ran by a
communist, the strong and committed stay grounded and bound by their Oaths,
and Honor to our Party. On behalf of the entire National Socialist Movement
and our affiliates Worldwide, I Salute all of you with the Iron resolve,
discipline, and fortitude to keep fighting forward no matter what. You are
true National Socialists, and it humbles me to serve every minute I can with
you. You people will be the hero's our Ancestors speak of generations from
now.
The Battle Rages on, see you on the frontlines. 88
