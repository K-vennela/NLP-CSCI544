Hi Keith,
Certainly not, and sorry for not clarifying. This is the response to the 
J. Climate comment by Von Storch that we're talking about here. The 
final draft is due this week, and so that's why I needed to check if you 
& Tim wanted co-authorship if we were going to show the GKSS result.
We can certainly plan to do a more detailed followup analysis jointly, I 
would very much enjoy that. Something we've talked about doing is a set 
of experiments with "mixed proxies" where the proxies have a variable 
combination of surface temperature and precip components--it will be 
very interesting to see what happens in these cases.
Perhaps this would be a good opportunity for collaboration, where we 
could apply this to several different models including CSM and the 
models you guys are working with?
let me know what you think.
thanks,
mike
