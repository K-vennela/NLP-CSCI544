Hi  Olga,
I agree with Valerie that the ice core evidence 
is ambiguous. I would personally place more 
weight on the alkenone data, which is a 
reasonable well calibrated SST proxy. Foraminifer 
transfer function based SSTs and some Mg/Ca 
results that are available suggest a similar 
picture as far as I know. Of course it is 
possible and plausible that the tropical oceans 
are behaving in a non consistent manner and not 
all areas are showing the same signal, but a 
sizeable portion appear to do so in order to 
conclude as we do in the chapter in my opinion. 
Some signals may be due to changes in in trade 
wind induced coastal upwelling strength, but 
there are enough cores with alkenone data outside 
of these areas. If we were to say more about the 
uncertainties it may be the fact that proxies are 
seasonally skewed.
My conclusion is to let the chapter say what we say at the moment.
Cheers,
Eystein
