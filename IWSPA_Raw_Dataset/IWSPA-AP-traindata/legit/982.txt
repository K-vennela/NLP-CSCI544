GET SMART FAST - "Trump is not expanding the GOP ... [E]arly-voting data shows little evidence for one of the Republican nominee's core claims," by Shane Goldmacher: "While Trump's insurgent candidacy has spurred record-setting Republican primary turnout in state after state, the early statistics show that the vast majority of those voters aren't actually new to voting or to the Republican Party, but rather they are reliable past voters in general elections ... In Iowa, Republican caucus turnout smashed its past record by 50 percent ... [but] 95 percent of the 2016 caucus-goers had previously voted in at least one of the last four presidential elections - and almost 80 percent had voted in
at least three of the last four."  <<link>>
