Dear Keith, Peck and Eystein,
as you'll have seen from Tom C's replies to my fairly direct requests for the 
data that went into his MWP 
figure, he seems somehow reluctant to send it to me and prefers me to find it 
myself (including 
spending a week re-assembling a Mongolian composite).  I have no time to do 
this, so have instead 
reverted to using the very similar data that we already had.  I'm sure it's so 
similar that it tells the same 
story.
So, the attached file is my latest attempt at the MWP figure.  It shows 8 
local/regional proxy series, 
normalised over a common period after filtering to the 20-year and longer time 
scale.  It also shows a 
composite mean, and no temperature scale.  The period covered is 850 to 1350.
What do you think?  Hopefully it is what you want.
I've started on the SH figure, having received data from Ricardo and borehole 
series for SH, S. Africa and 
Australia from Jason/Henry.  I need to sort out Tasmania / New Zealand 
instrumental data - Ed has this, 
though I could extract appropriate boxes from the Jone et al. gridded data set 
if necessary.
I'll include these series:
S American trees*2 plus instrumental T overlaid
S African and Australian boreholes (must also overlay instrumental T to 
explain why values are all 
negative - due to early sampling prior to strongest warmng)
Tasmanian and New Zealand trees*2 plus instrumental T)
It may be Friday by the time I get this one done.
Cheers
Tim
