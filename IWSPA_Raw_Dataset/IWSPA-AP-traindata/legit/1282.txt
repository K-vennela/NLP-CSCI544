Hi all,
it is in the middle of the night here, and I cannot provide much input to writing. Just
wished to say that I would be willing to sign on the draft as it is, but hope those writing
would consider the input from Susan and Kevin before submitting the final letter.

Hi Piers et al,
I have taken the liberty to suggest a few changes (with change tracker turned on) - while
you Europeans (oops, and Brits) at least are sleeping.  And Piers and Richard, thanks a lot
for getting this moving quickly.
Regards, Ken
ps. Piers - my salary is paid by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. They are VERY uneasy when I
speak or write letters to the press, but they get really upset when I don't credit them
appropriately. C'est la vie.
