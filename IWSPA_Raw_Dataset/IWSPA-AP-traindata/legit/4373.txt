HI Tom,
My understanding of the papers from the borehole community ever since the 1997 GRL article
by Huang et al is that they no longer believe that the data has proper sensitivity to
variations prior to about AD 1500--in fact, I don't believe anyone in that community now
feels they can meaningfully go farther back that that. Huang contributed the section on
boreholes in chapter 2 for IPCC (2001), and wrote the very words to that effect...
Now, the possible influences on boreholes might lead to inferred trends in GST that are
different from those in  SAT is a different one. A number of independent recently published
papers by (Beltrami et al; Stiglitz et al; Mann and Schmidt) and others have demonstrated
that there should be expectations for significant differences between past SAT (what we
care about) and GST variations (what boreholes in the best case scenario see) due to
snowcover influences, etc. We don't have time to discuss that in this very short piece, so
I tried, as briefly as possible, to cover our bases on this issue, in a way that doesn't
really stir up the pot w/ the borehole folks...
I'm interested in any further thoughts on the above,
mike
