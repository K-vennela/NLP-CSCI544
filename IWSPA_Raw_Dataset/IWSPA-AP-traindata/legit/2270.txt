Robinov: thx to Stefan's efforts, PWC signed off on the structure  that works for us and the bank. We have a draft provision we need to review in the am, but Bryan Wolfe knows it's coming. Before we finalize anything, we'll walk u through it, but it's the best possible result.
chappie: PWC also signed off on this structure. Stefan and I are meeting with asif and his team Monday to hopefully finalize. We are optimistic the film can stay in march.
