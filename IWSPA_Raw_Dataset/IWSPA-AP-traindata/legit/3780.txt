Subject: EOS revision
Hi Ed and Keith
for your information, I attached the revision of the EOS article. In this version we
added some lines about the data-overlap between the MBH and ECS records.
I also attached a figure showing a comparison between MBH and EsperFULL (using all data)
and EsperSUB (without Tornetraesk and the Polar Urals).
Take care
Jan
