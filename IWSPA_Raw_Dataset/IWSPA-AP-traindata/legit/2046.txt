The Morning Call reports "Military's mental health
screening not working". Well, who's surprised?
Personally I wouldn't submit a dog to psych mental
health screening.
Your assignment is to vigorously attack the psychs who
are victimizing our fine soldiers with their
intrusive, fraudulent mental health screening.
1. Read or scan the article at:
<<link>>,0,5844485.story?co
ll=all-news-hed
TEXT BELOW
2. Write a letter to the editor.
-If your last name begins with A-K, attack the
psychiatric diagnoses as being unscientific, no
chemical imbalance etc. If you need hatting, go to
<<link>>
-If your last name begins with L-P, point out that
most, if not all, of the soldiers who commit suicide
are under psych treatment, most of them on psych
drugs. Even the article tells you, in the final
sentences that the soldier they're writing about was
on psych drugs, "Bailey took powerful anti-psychotic
medication, and most of the time it was enough to keep
him mentally even. But not always."
-If your last name begins with Q-Z, write about how
screening itself is unreliable and unscientific and is
really just the latest scam to get more people on
psych drugs. If you need hatting go to
www.psychsearch.net/teenscreen.html. Don't mention
TeenScreen in your letter but all the information
applies.
