Hi gang - Richard is raising important issues, and Keith is going to 
respond in some detail on Friday when he gets back. I am cc'ing this 
to a broader group of IPCC Chap 6 folks so that we make sure we (chap 
6) deal with the issues correctly. I'm hoping that Keith will cc to 
us all, and we'll go from there.
For those just in on the issue raised by Richard. There is a paper 
written by Rosanne D'Arrigo that apparently casts serious doubt on 
the ability of tree ring data to reconstruct the full range of past 
temperature change - particularly temperatures above mid-20th century 
levels. Chap 6 obviously has to deal with this more in the next 
draft, so Eystein and I would like to get on top of it starting this 
week.
Keith or Richard - do you have a copy of this paper? Is it accepted?
Thanks, Peck
