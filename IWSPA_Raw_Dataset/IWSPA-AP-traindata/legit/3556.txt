Dear Claudia,
The 13th session of the Working Group on Climate Modelling (WGCM) is 
going to be taking place in San Francisco at the end of this month. 
PCMDI is hosting this event. I just received an invitation to talk about 
IDAG at this meeting. I'd be very happy to do this, but would appreciate 
some guidance from you and others regarding what aspects of IDAG you'd 
like me to discuss.
With best regards,
Ben
