Hilary Lawrence.
You have seen her name in our e-mails. She has spoken at our events. Her v=
oice has been on the other end of the line to encourage people to particip=
ate in our communities.
She is my Mama. Our Mama. For Donovan=2C Dexter=2C Larry and myself.  Hila=
ry Lawrence is a remarkable=2C phenomenal and amazing woman.
Mama Hilary is a devout Christian who sings=2C prays=2C leads services and=
preaches from time to time.  Mama worked long hours for 40 years at a man=
ufacturing plant for us.  She beat breast cancer and overcame adversity. S=
he's a loving Grandmother=2C Aunt and mentor to countless people.
She did all of these things for us because Hilary Lawrence is a MOTHER.
Like so many mothers=2C Mama did everything so we could dream of being any=
thing.  Our hopes are realized because she refused to allow the reality on=
the outside to deny us of our aspirations.
Across many cultures and continents=2C motherhood is a universal language=
understood by mothers=2C grandmothers=2C sisters=2C aunts and women caret=
akers. These are the women who gave us life=2C encouraged us during tough=
times=2C nourished us to health when we were sick and gave us the love an=
d support we needed to pursue our dreams.
This year=2C the New York State Legislature passed a budget that provides=
workers with up to 12 weeks of paid family leave benefits to care for inf=
ants and family members with a serious health condition. I support paid fa=
mily leave because I understand how important it is to be with an infant d=
uring those first few months and how equally important it is to be able to=
care for loved ones without fear of losing your job. Being a mother or a=
caretaker should never be a burden. Our laws must continue to support=2C=
not punish=2C women responsible for filling these roles.
"From No House in Jamaica to the Black House at Northwestern University=2C=
to The White House in Washington=2C D.C. to the state house in Albany." =
Those words are not just my personal motivational mantra=2C it's our fami=
ly's journey.  A journey that was filled with Mama helping me through the=
Top Tomato little league baseball team=2C karate class=2C piano and Spani=
sh lessons (which I promise Mama that I will return to both)=2C preaching=
the gospel=2C singing in choir=2C volunteering with children and seniors=
and now serving my community.
Saying Happy Mother's Day is not enough for me to say to you Mama and to a=
ll of the mothers out there. I say THANK YOU. I love you. None of us would=
be here without you.  I owe my all to you.
Hilary Lawrence =E2=80=93 Every day is Mother's Day.  I'm just happy the w=
orld takes a moment to show you and all of the glorious mothers out there=
love today because as the subject line says=2C
My mother is my EVERYTHING.
