Dear Phil,
I've known Rick Piltz for many years. He's a good guy. I believe he used 
to work with Mike MacCracken at the U.S. Global Change Research Program.
I'm really sorry that you have to go through all this stuff, Phil. Next 
time I see Pat Michaels at a scientific meeting, I'll be tempted to beat 
the crap out of him. Very tempted.
I'll help you to deal with Michaels and the CEI in any way that I can. 
The only reason these guys are going after you is because your work is 
of crucial importance - it changed the way the world thinks about human 
effects on climate. Your work mattered in the 1980s, and it matters now.
With best wishes,
Ben
