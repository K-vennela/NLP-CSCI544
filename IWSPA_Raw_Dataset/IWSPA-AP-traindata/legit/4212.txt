Bernie Sanders has won the Rhode Island Democratic primary, according to the Associated Press.
Hillary Clinton topped Sanders 43 percent to 34 percent with 16 percent undecided heading into Tuesday's primary, according to a poll by Brown University's Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy, which was conducted from April 19 to 21. But another survey, conducted by left-leaning Public Policy Polling from April 22 to 24, found Sanders leading Clinton 49 percent to 45 percent thanks to support from independents. 
The Sanders campaign spent more than $230,000 in Rhode Island on radio and TV ads in the last week. Clinton's campaign spent less than half as much. She and her husband, however, visited the state four times while Sanders only made one stop. And Clinton had the support of Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo.
Rhode Island awards 15 of its pledged delegates proportionally, in addition to another nine who will be selected at the party's state convention in June.
