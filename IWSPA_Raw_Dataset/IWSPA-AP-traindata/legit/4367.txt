Hello,
I wanted to ask you if you would like to donate some funds towards a
contribution in helping a *NSM member*. This guy who does a lot for the
party, with no help at all. I think it would be nice to present him a money
order to help in his aid for everything he does. To be used how ever he
wishes to use it.
What does he do, well he answers all the NSM hotline calls that comes
through as well as mails them things about NSM and the membership
application.  As well as does a out reach program to prisoners that are at
least racial aware in aided them with racial aware info, books, and such.
I know he has a lot of pride so *I think it is best not to let this get back
to him for now.*
If you are able to donate something even a dollar or two, it all adds up.
His name is Sean and he works for the party day in and day out. A true
soldier he has a lot of pride and when asked if he would do this and if he
needed help money wise he turned it down a couple of years ago.
All donation funds that are gathered up here in Ohio will be sent to HQ if
maybe you can pass the "hat" around at one of your unit meetings and send it
to HQ as well and let them know what the money is for a contribution towards
a NSM member.
I keep in contact with him and he has some medical problems and I think it
would be a good idea if some of us that can shows our support to him and
doing this will show how thankful we are. He is a older gentlemen who is
retired and he does a lot for NSM as well as to all who ask for information
about WP.
Please let me know if you can add to the contribution to the funds to help
him out either way thank you.
