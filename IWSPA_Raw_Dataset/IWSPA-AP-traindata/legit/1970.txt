thanks. Agree on the attribution front, but what about being more specific (at least a
little) about what the "subsequent evidence" is. Is there really anything new that gives us
more confidence?
Keith? Eystein?
thx, peck
Hi,
I think this version of bullett two is best:
o       The TAR pointed to the "exceptional warmth of the late 20th century, relative to
the past 1000 years". Subsequent evidence reinforces this conclusion. Indeed, it is very
likely that average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th
century were warmer than any other 50-year period in the last 500 years. It is also
likely that this was the warmest period in the past 1300 years . The uneven coverage and
characteristics of the proxy data mean that these conclusions are most robust over
summer, extra-tropical, land areas.
I agree with Keith we cannot enter into the attibution aspects that Susan alludes to.
