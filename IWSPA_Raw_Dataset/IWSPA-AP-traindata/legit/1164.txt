Donald Trump has won the Connecticut Republican primary, according to three television networks.
The Manhattan real estate magnate held comfortable double-digit leads over both John Kasich and Ted Cruz, respectively, in recent polls from the state. In a Quinnipiac University survey conducted from April 12-18, Trump led Kasich 48 percent to 28 percent, approaching the 50 percent necessary to win all of the state's 28 delegates.
Trump rallied supporters last Saturday in Waterbury and in Bridgeport, where he drew capacity crowds at both venues.
Connecticut awards its 28 delegates on a proportional basis, though a candidate receiving 50 percent or more of the vote receives all of the state's at-large and congressional-level delegates.
