Dear chapter 6 friends,
I have a request on procedure. In the interest of a good and constructive working
atmosphere, I would suggest that all of us focus on sober scientific arguments and refrain
from unneccessarily derogatory comments about the work of colleagues. I'm referring in this
case to David's comment
- this reference is overused, especially for such a simplistic model
The reference concerned is our theory of DO events which appeared in Nature in 2001 and has
since been cited 133 times according to the Web of Science (a sign of overuse?) The model
concerned is the CLIMBER-2 model, featured in over 50 peer-reviewed publications since
1998, including 7 in Nature and Science.
This model is different from David's model, because it has been constructed for a
differenet purpose, but it is not "simplistic". It would never occur to me to call David's
model "simplistic" because it does not include an interactive continental ice sheet model,
vegetation model, carbon cycle model, sediment model and isotope model.
I'm absolutely open to any rational scientific criticism and discussion, but I can see no
purpose in derogatory statements like the above, which include not even a trace of
scientific argument. This kind of thing only poisons the working atmosphere in our group,
which I thought was very positive and a great pleasure in Beijing.
Regards, Stefan
