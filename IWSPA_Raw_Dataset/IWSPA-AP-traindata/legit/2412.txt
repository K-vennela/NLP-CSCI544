Dear all
attached is my latest (currently definitive) version of the responses to the
"sky-blue-highlighted" comments on text and Figures.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE HAVE CHANGED IN VARIOUS PLACES FROM WHAT I SENT EARLIER AS WELL AS
BEING UPDATED. I would suggest that they be cut and pasted into the document rather than
just including the new ones. Sorry  , but I had to reconsider a number of responses and
edit others to remove typos etc.
Even though marked in blue  - a few were not relevant to me. Two have been marked with
"Valerie " - (6-1072, 6-1073) . Those marked PECK (6-862 through 6-868; ie 7 comments) are
best dealt with by he. The comment 6-1110 is for Stefan. The comments marked F are those I
sent from Fortunat before and I also sent the edited version of Ricardo's. The two
outstanding ones he marked for me/Tim are here (6-818 and 6-819)
6-818  Noted - this issue will be reviewed , though the discussion of forcings must come
before that of comparison of simulation results.
6-819  Noted - the text is intended to provide examples only and will be modified to refer
to Table 6.2 , where details of all simulations used are provided.
I think that should be OK as far as my stuff goes. I will send minor changes to text
(separate message) that have arisen in dealing with final comments.
Cheers
Keith
