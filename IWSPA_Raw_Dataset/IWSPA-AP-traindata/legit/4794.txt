THINGS PEOPLE TRIED TO IGNORE  
HONG KONG PROTESTS                               
THE STORY
Over the weekend, protests in Hong Kong turned chaotic, with police in riot gear using pepper spray and teargas on crowds.
WHAT’S THIS ABOUT?
Although it’s officially ruled by China, Hong Kong kinda does its own thing. For the first time, China recently said it would let people elect the city’s leader. But a lot of people in Hong Kong think that’s BS, since a committee tight with the Chinese government would be the one screening the candidates. So if it looks like a Chinese proxy government, and it’s screened like one, would it be one?
SO WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING?
Since earlier this month, there have been peaceful student protests. Over the weekend, the situation seriously ramped up – tens of thousands of protesters showed up, and many were met with tear gas from riot police. Dozens of students were arrested. Today, the riot police have gone home, but the protesters are still on the streets.

This was the harshest police response in Hong Kong in almost a decade. China called the protests illegal. As for the protesters? They aren’t leaving.
ISIS                               
THE STORY
In an interview that aired last night, President Obama said that the US “underestimated” ISIS.  You don’t say?
HOW THE F DID WE GET HERE?
The US left Iraq less than three years ago, after helping put a government in place, training the military, and leaving equipment there. In the meantime, Syria’s civil war happened and in the middle of sectarian strife, extremist groups (think al Qaeda cousins and friends) found room to grow. Meanwhile, Iraq’s government ended up alienating a significant amount of the population, giving ISIS an opening to gain traction. And now here we are.
ANYTHING ELSE?
Also yesterday, House Speaker Boehner said that the US may have “no choice” but to put boots on the ground in Iraq. Which is the one thing Obama’s always said will never, ever happen.

While Obama would probably like to give Boehner a timeout for talking “boots on the ground,” here’s one thing they can agree on: the US misjudged not only ISIS, but the stability of the Iraq it left behind. History repeating itself is never fun.
REPEAT AFTER ME... 
WHAT TO SAY WHEN SOMEONE BRINGS UP THEIR WEEKEND HIKE…
Meanwhile, in Japan…Over the weekend, Japan’s Mount Ontake erupted unexpectedly with at least 250 people hiking it. 36 are believed to have died. The last time Mount Ontake erupted was in the late ’70s. Also in ‘science is scary’ news, over the weekend a “swarm” of mini-earthquakes hit Mammoth Lakes, CA. They were enough to rattle residents’ coffee but are apparently a part of normal life for those living near the Mammoth Mountain volcano.
WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU’RE STUCK AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR FANTASY LEAGUE’S STANDINGS…
Well, this is demoralizing. Yesterday, Europe beat the US in golf’s Ryder Cup for the eighth time in the last ten tournaments. The Ryder Cup is that event that happens every two years when American and Euro players face off to determine which side of the pond is dominant in all-things-golf. Team Euro made it happen with some help from world no. 1 Rory McIlroy. And then celebrated by pouring champagne on each other while wearing suits.

WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU DROP YOUR COFFEE…
Could’ve done without that. Remember last week when a man managed to scale the White House fence, run across the lawn, and walk inside through the unlocked front door? Turns out that’s not the only palm-to-forehead moment the Secret Service has had in the last few years. Yesterday we found out that it wasn’t exactly on its A-game back in November 2011, when a gunman fired at least seven shots on the White House with a semiautomatic rifle. President Obama and the First Lady weren’t there at the time — but Sasha was, and Malia was on her way home. A Secret Service supervisor reportedly told agents to “stand down,” thinking the gunshots were just nearby construction. It wasn’t until four days later that a housekeeper noticed a few things — like broken glass — upstairs. The gunman was later arrested. “Homeland” starts next week.

WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU GET THE RENT DEPOSIT BACK FROM YOUR OLD APARTMENT…
Time to do a little shopping. Japan’s SoftBank has some extra cash-money on hand thanks to its stake in Alibaba (reminder: biggest IPO ever). And it’s going shopping. Over the weekend, we found out SoftBank is in talks to buy DreamWorks Animation in a deal that would reportedly be valued at $3.4 billion. DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has been looking for a buyer for the Hollywood studio, which has struggled at the box-office lately. DreamWorks is an attractive company for Softbank, which is looking for media content to offer on its mobile networks. There have been worse things to experience on your morning commute than “That’ll do, donkey.”
