format=flowed Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Sarah, I realize that you have got a copy of
this. What I am concerned about is the use of MAGICC in AR4. It is likely that the only way
that MAGICC can be legitimately used is for it to be (again!) calibrated against the
various AOGCMs being run for AR4. The AOGCM data that will be available this time will
allow us to do this more comprehensively than your TAR analysis. I think this is something
we should do together this time. I will talk to Jerry Meehl about this tomorrow or next
week, and also discuss how best to do this statistically with Doug Nychka -- with a view to
submitting a joint proposal. I would also like to involve Ben, since he is adept at getting
appropriate data from PCMDI/CMIP data files, and he can add insights that we may otherwise
miss. So the proposal would involve you, me, Doug and Ben. Tom. ================== --------

of global coupled model output for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change. This is an open announcement, so please feel free to forward it to
anyone who may be interested. Sincerely, The WGCM Climate Simulation Panel Gerald Meehl,
