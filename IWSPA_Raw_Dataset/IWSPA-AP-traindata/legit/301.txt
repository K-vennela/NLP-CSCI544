SNEAK PEEK: GRASSLEY DEFENDS JUDICIARY RECORD - Ahead of the most intense day yet of the Democrats' pressure campaign against Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) over Merrick Garland, the Judiciary Committee chairman is pre-butting the expected attacks with a new report highlighting his track record on the Judiciary Committee. It outlines legislation passed (14 bills out of committee have passed the Senate and six have become law, comparatively higher than the committee in the last Congress, then led by Democrats) and nominations cleared (hearings for 43 nominees by the end of May, same number as a Dem-led committee did at the same point under President George W. Bush).
