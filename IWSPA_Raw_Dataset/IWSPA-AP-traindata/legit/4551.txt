Crew,
We're going to play good letter writer / bad letter
writer. Kind of like good cop / bad cop.
If your last name ends in A-C, J-L, P-S, I want you to
write a "nice" letter, sympathetic to parents who've
lost their children to suicide and hopeful that
parents will love their children and protect them from
evil "mental health" intrusions into their lives. Tone
level = 2.5 and above.
If your last name ends in D-I, M-R, or T-Z, I want you
to write a brutal nasty letter about this politician
who messed up with his own child, resulting in the
child's suicide and now wants everyone to repeat his
mistakes (turning over his kid to psychiatry). Write
it in any tone level you want as long as it's 2.0 or
below.
And if you just can't manage to write it in the
assigned tone, no sweat, write it the other way.
Here's the assignment:
1. Read the article from today's Washington Post.

685.html
NOTE - YOU HAVE TO REGISTER TO READ IT ONLINE. IT'S
FREE BUT ANNOYING.
The text is down below.
2. Write your letter to the editor and send it to
user@domain.com. Follow the above guidelines but
throw in any of the usual true lines we need to
promote - "no science to psychiatry", "psych drug
dangers", "psych diagnoses are subjective and
arbitrary".
3. Report compliance by email.
Thank you,
Doyle
