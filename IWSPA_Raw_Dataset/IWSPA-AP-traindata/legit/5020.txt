Dear Tim,
Thanks for the "heads up". As Phil mentioned, I was already aware of 
this. The Douglass et al. paper was rejected twice before it was finally 
accepted by IJC. I think this paper is a real embarrassment for the IJC. 
It has serious scientific flaws. I'm already working on a response.
Phil can tell you about some of the other sordid details of Douglass et 
al. These guys ignored information from radiosonde datasets that did not 
support their "models are wrong" argument (even though they had these 
datasets in their possession). Pretty deplorable behaviour...
Douglass is the guy who famously concluded (after examining the 
temperature response to Pinatubo) that the climate system has negative 
sensitivity. Amazingly, he managed to publish that crap in GRL. Christy 
sure does manage to pick some brilliant scientific collaborators...
With best regards,
Ben
