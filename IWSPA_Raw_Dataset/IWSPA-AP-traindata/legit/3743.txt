fair enough, I'll go w/ flimsy. The real problem is the fairly 
inflammatory wording of this, and the really flawed interpretations 
w.r.t. implicatinos for natural vs. anthropogenic variaiblity.
normally I'd ignore, but the fact that Andy Revkin received this 
suggests they are trying to publicize this review paper, which I find a 
bit odd...
