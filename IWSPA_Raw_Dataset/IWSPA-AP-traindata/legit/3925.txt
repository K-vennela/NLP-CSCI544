uccessful Volunteer Program:
Essential Considerations Not to Be Overlooked
Best fulfill your mission by the avoiding pitfalls and=A0
maximizing the benefits associated with volunteers.
Volunteerism is a cornerstone of successful nonprofit management, and every=
one agrees that volunteers are essential in assisting a nonprofit fulfill i=
ts mission. Yet experience shows that nonprofits often have difficultly rec=
ruiting qualified volunteers and also find it difficult to retain and produ=
ctively utilize those that they do recruit. Why this happens may be more di=
fficult to understand than it appears. Part of the answer may relate to a v=
olunteer becoming disillusioned and not fully understanding what volunteeri=
ng really involves and how the volunteer's efforts help the nonprofit satis=
fy its mission. Another part of the answer might also involve the nonprofit=
failing to do the required "homework." In other words, in its haste to beg=
in delivering its programs, the nonprofit may not have paid enough attentio=
n to what is really involved in building a successful volunteer program.=A0
Can you answer these questions?
Do you have a clear vision of your mission that is easily communicated to y=
our volunteers?=A0
Do you have a meaningful training program in place?=A0
Have you given enough thought to how employees and volunteers will interact=
with each other?=A0
Are you aware of the legal framework within which your volunteers will be w=
orking?=A0
These are just some of the questions that a successful volunteer program mu=
st answer. Not taking the time in advance to answer these and other questio=
ns may mean that your volunteer program is going to suffer from a continuou=
s "revolving door" of coming and going volunteers, and your ability to focu=
s on your mission may be undermined.=A0
Please join Lynn Ivey, an experienced nonprofit consultant and former nonpr=
ofit executive and volunteer, as she discusses the key elements that go int=
o building a successful volunteer program and offers insights based on her =
own hands-on experiences both as a nonprofit executive as well as a volunte=
er.
