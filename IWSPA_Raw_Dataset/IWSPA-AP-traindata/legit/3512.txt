Dear Colleagues,
In the email from Armin Haas (signed by Carlo and Klaus) on 5th March, we were informed
that a strategy committee and a research committee had been formed; with the latter being
primarily responsible for the preparation of the proposal.
WE NOW HAVE ONLY 20 WORKING DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE PROPOSAL HAS TO BE SUBMITTED!!!
And while I am aware and involved in a number of parallel activities addressing the writing
of text for specific work domains and work packages, I have not received any formal
communication about what role is expected of me as a member of the research committee (that
has primary responsibility for the preparation of the proposal).
Needless to say I find this extremely worrying, and suggest that we URGENTLY need
clarification about 1) exactly what the research committee should do; 2) how it should do
it; 3) what responsibility for making decisions this committee will have/how it should
liaise with the strategy committee.
It seems clear that in order to finalize an overall project structure we will need to meet
face-to-face for at least 36 hours, and that this needs to happen with the utmost urgency.
I have made a provisional booking of a facility very near Stanstead airport in the UK for
next Monday and Tuesday (17th and 18th March), and offer this as a possible time and place
to meet; but am of course open to other suggestions. I would imagine that in addition to
the research committee assigned so far, we would need to co-opt the writers of several of
the work packages and the work domains leaders for the purpose of this meeting.
With warm regards and the utmost sense of urgency,
Alex Haxeltine
