Hi Stefan and Fortunat: Attached are the draft figs that include 
proxy obs, simulations, and comparisons of the two. As you can see, 
Tim just sent them. Big job, but they look great in my eyes.
See Tim's email below for more background info.
We need fast feedback from you both, specifically:
1) any general comments on the figs - this is a crux set of figures 
and we need your eyes to look at them carefully
2) is it wise to keep the new EMIC run panel attached to the second 
figure as attached? I vote yes, but what do you think. It fits w/ the 
other panels pretty well.
3) either way, we need caption prose from you (perhaps Fortunat 
start, and Stefan edit, or vice versa if Stefan can start first) on 
the new EMIC panel.
4) also, we need a new para, or prose that can be added to a para, 
that describes the panel and it's implications as it informs our 
assessment. Keith will then integrate this into the section. I'm not 
sure of this, but perhaps you could start with a new question 
heading, and then have a short para to go under it - something like 
"What is the significance of the new reduced-amplitude estimates of 
past solar variability?"
Of course, we need your feedback and prose asap. Please send to me, 
Eystein, Keith and Tim.
Thanks in advance for the help. Best, peck
