Dear Phil, Eystein and Peck,
I've already talked about this to Phil and Keith, but for Eystein's 
and Peck's benefit the emails copied below relate to McIntyre 
downloading a PDF of a manuscript cited by the IPCC paleo chapter and 
then apparently trying to interfere with the editorial process that 
the paper is currently going through at JGR.
I think this is an abuse of McIntyre's position as an IPCC reviewer.
Rosanne replied to my email below, to say that they *do* want this 
taken further.  So...
Phil has agreed to forward these messages to Susan Solomon and Michael Manning.
Eystein and Peck: do you want to add anything too?
Cheers
Tim
