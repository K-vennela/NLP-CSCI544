Free Erich Priebke Now!!! 
Forward this and pass this on to all National Socialists in the World, lets make this effort Worldwide!
Comrades,    
A few minutes of your time, and 90 cents for postage is all we are asking here. If you recall a couple of weeks ago I sent out a copy of a report from an NSM Correspondent in Rome, concerning Erich Priebke and his situation. Now, we are asking the Party membership and all of our Comrades to assist in this effort to free an SS Officer. 
Thank you in advance. Remember, our enemies never forget, and never forgive, they have stalked this man even in the twilight years of his life, relentlessly hounding him. He fought against Communism and World jewry. Erich Priebke is a living HERO, do your part now, don't put this on the list of things to do, just do it, now! 88
