Cracking Down on Unfair Practices - Mandatory Arbitration and Non-Compete A=
greements
*         America's economy continues to come back - creating 14.4 million =
private sector jobs over the longest streak of job growth on record, 73 str=
aight months.
*         But too many Americans still aren't sharing in the benefits of th=
at economic progress. One reason for that is that too often large corporati=
ons are stifling fair competition and stacking the deck against workers, en=
trepreneurs, and consumers.
*         Today the Administration highlighted important pieces of progress=
toward addressing these kinds of unfair practices: mandatory arbitration c=
lauses and the improper use of non-compete agreements.
*         First, today, the independent Consumer Financial Protection Burea=
u put out a new proposal that is designed to crack down on the use of manda=
tory arbitration clauses.
*         In recent years, many financial products - from bank accounts to =
credit cards - have found a way to avoid accountability by burying mandator=
y arbitration clauses deep in the fine print of hundreds of millions of con=
tracts.
*         Mandatory arbitration clauses deny consumers the ability to join =
their resources, band together with others who have been harmed, and get th=
eir day in court. That's just not right.
*         Today's action is yet another example of the important work of th=
e CFPB, which was created by Wall Street Reform.
*         In addition to writing stronger rules of the road for mortgages, =
credit cards, and student loans, through enforcement actions the Bureau has=
put nearly $11 billion back in the pockets of more than 25 million consume=
rs who have been harmed by illegal practices.
*         That's why the President fought so hard to create a strong CFPB a=
nd why it's so appalling that Republicans in Congress have proposed to repe=
al the CFPB in their budget.
*         Also today, the White House released a report underscoring the ne=
ed to reform the use of non-compete agreements, which deny workers the abil=
ity to leave a company and go work for another company in the same industry=
.
*         Far too often these agreements aren't credibly protecting trade s=
ecrets. Instead, they're unnecessary roadblocks for workers trying to get a=
raise, move up by joining another employer, or start their own company.
*         Nearly one in five workers - including 14 percent of low-wage wor=
kers - are subject to them. That holds their bargaining power and their wag=
es down.
*         In the coming months the Administration will build on the example=
s of states that have taken actions highlighted in the report and put forwa=
rd possible options for reform and encourage more states to take action and=
to make sure employers are treating their employees fairly.
*         The President knows that the best way to make sure everyone share=
s in our economic success is through healthy competition and stronger prote=
ctions that guarantee consumers are treated fairly. That's what today's act=
ions to combat both of these unfair practices are about.
