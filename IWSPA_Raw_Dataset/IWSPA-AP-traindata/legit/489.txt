Awesome speech will work good in Milwaukee, and great I will be there
Thursday in Minneapolis to pick you up. That is the Minneapolis terminal
downtown correct, not St. Paul right? Send me that cell number you have if
you have some minutes on it in case I can't find you. Either way, we will
make it work. I am totally fired up for this event too. 88 Commander Schoep
