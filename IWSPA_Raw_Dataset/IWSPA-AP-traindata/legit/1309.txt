<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much for being able to answer some questions for me. Here is the email that I sent the commander. Instead of going back through and deleting certain items I will send it to you whole. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Commander Schoep,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for taking some time to read this message, Sorry about the last&nbsp;one.&nbsp;You must be slammed with messages from who knows who. My name is Joshua Davenport.&nbsp;I've wrote to you before and I thank you so much for replying back. But unfortunately I cannot seem to get a hold of anyone else. Ive sent messages to both <SPAN class=yshortcuts id=lw_1210895923_0 style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">Charles Wilson</SPAN> and to S.S. Mann, regarding several different subjects. S.S. Mann I wrote to about 2 weeks ago, and <SPAN class=yshortcuts id=lw_1210895923_1 style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">Charles Wilson</SPAN> over a month and a half ago. So maybe you would be able to help me out since I cant get a hold of them. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My inquiries are not that serious, but it does get aggravating to not be able to contact higher command. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>First inquiry-&nbsp;a guy that I work with&nbsp;was asking a lot about our movement. I have come to know this gentleman and his family very well over the last year or so, and he wishes to join our party. A couple of months ago he made an admittance to me that I felt should be brought to higher command, and like I said before, had no such luck getting a response. Anyways he told me that his wife is a quarter Japanese. I had no clue since she looked white to me. I am uninformed on our racial guidelines for acceptance into the <SPAN class=yshortcuts id=lw_1210895923_2 style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">National Socialist Movement</SPAN>. Although I have read Heinrich Himmler's Race Theory and Mate Selection Guidelines. Which states that woman that were a quarter or less Jewish, would be allowed to be&nbsp;&nbsp;brought into the Aryan race as Aryans...</P>
<P>How do our guidelines work?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and she also wishes to join...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Second inquiry- I have some extra time and money to offer the N.S.M, and I am ready and willing to take on some administrative tasks. I speak with Shawn McBride from <SPAN class=yshortcuts id=lw_1210895923_3 style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">Michigan</SPAN> all the time&nbsp;and has told me that he is slammed with phone calls, letters, and sending info out to people. We are extremely slow here in <SPAN class=yshortcuts id=lw_1210895923_4 style="BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">Nevada</SPAN>, and I want to take on some extra leadership to get this unit and all future members from all over the country moving. So if there is anything that I can do for the party in regards to sending info, answering calls, to anything, please let me know. </P>
<P>I have been with the N.S.M for I believe almost a year. I love what we do and I have a lot of respect for my unit leader. He is a great guy and gives a lot of good advice to me. We have lost one of our members. His name is John De long. He went for the worst kind of treason I have ever heard. I'm not going to go into details I just wanted to give you an update. I myself have been unable to attend any of the N.S.M rallies so far do to legalities and being seen on t.v. but after September I will be taking on an active role as much as I can. </P>
<P>My wife and I are having a baby that is due July 13th. A little girl. I look forward to sending you a picture of my new family when the time comes. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Third inquiry- Can you recommend any good DVDs or audio Cd's that give an accurate description of&nbsp;jews and of&nbsp;<SPAN class=yshortcuts id=lw_1210895923_5 style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">Adolf Hitler</SPAN>?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And finally, I did not know who to contact about this issue, but I was under the impression that if I purchased the N.S.M Storm trooper uniform, that six months after my membership probation I would be sent&nbsp;an N.S.M patch. </P>
<P>Also, I did not&nbsp;know who to contact regarding my address change. I will give this to you now just in case.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Joshua Davenport</P>
<P><SPAN class=yshortcuts id=lw_1210895923_6 style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">5979 Aimless&nbsp;Street</P>
<P>Henderson, NV 89011</SPAN></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My old address was</P>
<P><SPAN class=yshortcuts id=lw_1210895923_7 style="BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">1770 N. Green Valley Parkway Apt. 2612</P>
<P>Henderson, NV. 89074</SPAN></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once again I thank you for taking time out of your busy day to respond to my inquiries and look forward to reading your message when I get home from work. Construction is horrible. The money is great, but its very frustrating to work with a bunch of disgusting sub human wetbacks. Just goes to show that not only do they take the jobs supposedly that white Americans wont take, they are taking the&nbsp;best paying jobs from working class citizens. If it weren't for the money they would be sitting on their asses. All they want is to&nbsp;take&nbsp;our money back to <SPAN class=yshortcuts id=lw_1210895923_8 style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">Mexico</SPAN> so they can sit on their asses there. But you already know all this. Your the&nbsp;Commander. LOL. Take care of yourself...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For Family, Race, and Nation,</P>
<P>Josh</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
