Dear Phil,
Yes, this is the same Geoff Smith who wrote to me. Do you know who he 
is? From his comments about the RMS, he seems to be a Brit.
In his email to you, Mr. Smith notes that: "there is a strong case to be 
made that intermediate results, e.g., collation of such data and the 
relevant code should be made available in studies such as this one, 
since there is an important possibility of errors in trying to replicate 
such a collation".
This is a key point. Douglass et al. already audited our "collation" of 
the primary temperature data (i.e., our calculation of synthetic MSU 
temperatures). As I've already told Mr. Smith, Douglass et al. obtained 
synthetic MSU temperatures very similar to the ones published in our 
IJoC paper. Mr. Smith does not understand this. Nor does he understand 
that the algorithms used to calculate synthetic MSU temperatures from 
raw model temperature data have already been published and documented in 
the peer-reviewed literature.
I think it would be useful to raise these issues with Paul Hardaker.
Cheers,
Ben
