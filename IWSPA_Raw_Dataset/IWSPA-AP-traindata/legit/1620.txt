Dear Keith,
you've done a great job on the touchy subject of the last millennium, 
which is central to our whole chapter.
My comments to that are threefold:
(1) If you could shorten the text somewhat, it could become more powerful
(2) Some small edits & comments are in the attached doc
(3) I propose some improvements to the figures as follows.
- Fig 1a the land temps seem to go off plot, temperature scale needs to 
be extended
- we need a break between panels a and the rest, since it's a different 
time scale on the x axis
- Fig 1c also has one curve going off the top
- Panels 1b-d might run the time axis up to 2010 or so, else the 
important rise at the end is hidden in the tick-marks and less obvious 
than it should be
- the legends need to say what the baseline period (zero line of y-axis) 
is (hard to find this in the axis label)
- this baseline should be the same for all curves, i.e. 1961-1990. Fig 
2d says 1901-1960 - it's not ideal to have a different one, as compared 
to Fig 1. Also, is it true? Surely the Storch curve is not shown 
relative to this baseline, it's way above it. Aligning it like this 
could lead to the dangerous misunderstanding that Storch suggests a much 
warmer medieval time compared to everyone else, which of course is not 
the case.
I hope this helps.
Cheers, Stefan
