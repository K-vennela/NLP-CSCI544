Dear Colleagues,
Due to the large number of participants at the Lead Authors meeting, the
location has been changed from IPCC WG II TSU offices to the World Bank, 
H Building, 600 19th Street, N.W.
The closest metro stop to this building is Farragut West on the orange and
blue lines.  Take the 18th Street exit from the metro and go one block to
19th Street and then two blocks over to G Street.  You will need a badge to
get
into the meeting, but someone will be there to help you with this.  In any
case, it may be a good idea to come a bit early on the first day to get
checked in.  The meeting begins at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday morning.
The Modelers meeting will still be held at the WG II TSU office as
originally planned.  That meeting starts at 8:30 a.m. on Monday morning. 
The address, once again, is 400 Virginia Avenue S.W., Suite 750,
Washington, D.C. 
We look forward to seeing everyone in Washington.
Best regards,
Anne Johnson
