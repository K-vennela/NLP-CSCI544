GUN SHOW: DONALD TRUMP's past support of gun control didn't stop him from securing the National Rifle Association's endorsement today - and using a speech in front of its members to attack HILLARY CLINTON.
Trump used his speech at the NRA's Leadership Forum in Louisville, Ky., to portray himself as a protector of the 2nd Amendment, POLITICO's Eli Stokols reports. And to cast Clinton as someone who would irrevocably harm gun rights. 
"The Second Amendment is on the ballot in November," Trump told the more than 7,000 NRA members gathered here for an annual meeting. "I will never let you down. I will protect our Second Amendment. I will protect our country."
Trump also railed against gun-free zones in remarks the GOP's presumptive nominee billed as off the cuff. 
"Gun-free zones. We're getting rid of gun-free zones, OK?" Trump said. "That I can tell you. We're getting rid of them."

2) SCATTER SHOTS: Terrorism, marital infidelity, gun rights. DONALD TRUMP's topics were disparate, but the array of attacks he uncorked over the last 24 hours had only one target in mind: HILLARY CLINTON the not-quite-official Democratic nominee. In a statement and a series of media appearances Trump previewed a caustic general election. He mocked Clinton's response to the EgyptAir crash as naive. <<link>> With all the subtlety of a bulldozer, he reminded the public of Bill Clinton's marital infidelity. <<link>> And before and during a speech in front of the NRA today Trump ripped Clinton's stance on guns, tweeting
that she would like to overrule the Supreme Court on the Second Amendment. <<link>> 
3) (NOT SO) FREE SPEECH: So, what is it like to give a six-figure speech? And what do you get for your money? POLITICO's Annie Karni does a bit of digging and gives you an idea: If you're paying $285,000 for Bill Clinton you get "a dose of the full Bubba, unplugged." And, apparently, a full accompaniment of presidential factoids: At one point, Clinton noted to a private audience that he'd learned that the combined weight of all the ants on Earth was greater than that of all the humans on the planet. <<link>> 
4) HOSTILE TAKEOVER: From Never Trump to whatever, Trump. POLITICO's Alex Isenstadt looks at the swift resignation of big pieces of the Republican party to DONALD TRUMP's ascent. The thawing, Isenstadt writes, has already begun in ways big and small. That includes potential mega donors like Foster Friess to rank-and-file operatives. <<link>> But elites more or less falling in line doesn't arrest some new electoral math, as POLITICO's Katie Glueck notes. GOP nominee DONALD TRUMP means some states that have been largely off the map for Democrats in recent cycles - think Georgia and Arizona - are at least nominally in play now. Recent polls show that
Trump's candidacy opens the door for HILLARY CLINTON in both of those states. <<link>> 
5) ROMNEY 3.0: Not everyone is assimilating to DONALD TRUMP's Republican Party. Erick Erickson is a conservative writer and media personality who has been leading efforts to find a suitable, conservative third-party candidate. On Friday, he wrote on The Resurgent he had one in particular in mind: MITT ROMNEY. <<link>> The 2012 nominee has been as steadfastly anti-Trump as anyone and, Erickson writes, is a much better alternative than HILLARY CLINTON. POLITICO's Brianna Gurciullo has more here: <<link>> 
BLAST NOTE: One reason this sticks out: Erickson has opposed Romney in his previous two bids for the presidency. 
TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, DONALD TRUMP schedules a meeting. Is London calling? The GOP's embrace in a chart. HILLARY CLINTON gets a come-and-get-me plea, but her graphics are panned. Philadelphia embraces the Bern.

WHAT'S NEXT: Candidates are locked in on the best coast. BERNIE SANDERS and Bill Clinton are both expected in San Diego this weekend and make other stops in California. Sanders is also in New Mexico tonight. HILLARY CLINTON speaks in Detroit on Monday. 
THEY SAID IT: "Congratulations on becoming a U.S. citizen, Alicia. Enjoy casting that vote."
- HILLARY CLINTON, tweeting to Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe who recently revealed that DONALD TRUMP called her "Miss Piggy." <<link>> 
MAGIC NUMBER: 3 million. That's how much, in dollars, Bill Clinton's been paid for speeches since his wife announced her second presidential bid. <<link>>
