Hi all, there is another reason why I should not be formally listed as 
an LA - it is my understanding that IPCC contributors have to be a 
little careful about getting involved in political matters that could be 
used to impugn the integrity of the process - well I am starting to do 
just that, with the attached commen in Eos, plus some radio interviews 
where I have been somewhat pointed in my thoughts.
I suppose its still ok to be a reviewer, but even then you might keep 
these comments in mind, tom
