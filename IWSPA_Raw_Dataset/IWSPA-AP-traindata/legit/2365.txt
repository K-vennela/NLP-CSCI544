that is a useful way to look at it.
again, takeaway msg is that mann method can only work if past variability 
same as variability during period used to calibrate your method.
so it could be correct, but could be very wrong as well.
by the way, von storch doesn't concur with osborn/briffa on the idea that 
higher past variability would mean there'd likley be high future 
variability as well (bigger response to ghg forcing).
he simply says it's time to toss hockeystick and start again, doesn't take 
it further than that.
is that right?
