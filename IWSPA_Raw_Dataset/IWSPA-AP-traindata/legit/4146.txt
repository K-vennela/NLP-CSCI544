To Whom All It May Concern, =20
14! 88!
The NSM Ohio has scheduled another book burning event to show the public =
that we stand up against the avalanche of pro-homosexual and lesbian books,=
literature that degrades the white race, books that promote anti-Christian=
morals, values and ethics, books that continue to promote Holocaust lies, =
books that promote non-existant black achievements as well as the  jewish =
Talmud which endorses the killing, rape, sodomization, theft, attacks on an=
d deceit of all non-jews.=20
For too long our nation has put up with this degenerate and perverted fi=
lth that is forced into our faces and  into our childrens schools! It's tim=
e to become part of history and show the world and nation that we are the o=
nes who have had enough! =20
This book burning is one way of peacefully gathering together, united, t=
o have comraderie and friendship with people who feel the same way as yours=
elf and to display in a public event how we desperately need to express our=
attempt to keep our nation from becoming a degraded cesspool of pornograph=
y and garbage hidden behind the titles of "art" or "literature". =20
The Ohio National Socialist Movement is going to change that. WE are tak=
ing a stand against the politically correct, manipulated schools system and=
publication industry that chooses to pollute our children and our lives wi=
th this misguided and deceptive agenda.=20
The Meeting will take place at 4 p.m. at Lewisburg Park on Dayton St. in=
Lewisburg, OH. We will carpool to another park for a National Geographic i=
nterview and public awareness meeting. From there we will proceed to a priv=
ate location for the book burning. Afterwards we will go to a meeting hall =
for refreshments and hot chow.=20
