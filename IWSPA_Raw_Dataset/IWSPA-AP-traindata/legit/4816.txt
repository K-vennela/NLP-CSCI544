Nick has been with our team for a year exactly this May. In the summer of 2015, Nick helped developed our new National Finance Committee list. At the end of that summer, Nick worked with our LGBT Director to plan and execute the LGBT Gala. Nick assisted with the money tracking, tagging, vitals, and other logisitical tasks. Throughout the fall, Nick assisted our regional finance directors primarily on two major events: the WLF Conference and our event with the President in Potomac, Maryland. Throughout the year, he has also kept the LGBT money tracker and assisted the LGBT Director with a variety of Finance events. Nick also regularly assists with several regional and council projects and works with the PAC Finance Firector to keep the PAC money tracker.
Given Nick's extensive involvement with and knowledge of the Finance Department, we believe he would be an excellent addition to our team. Although he is still in school and cannot be formally hired, he works in the office five days a week and should, therefore, receive a weekly stipend for food and transportation.
