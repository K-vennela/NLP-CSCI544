Good Wednesday morning, Illinois. It is the day of reckoning for U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 74, who is to be sentenced in federal court for his role in violating banking laws. But as we well know by now, the case is about so much more. Prosecutors say Hastert abused at least five students when he served as wrestling coach at Yorkville High School and keeping that secret served as the underlying motivation in his federal court case. 
Hastert's lawyers have said he was near death and uses a wheel chair. They're factoring health into their arguments calling for probation. U.S. District Judge Thomas M. Durkin will also weigh testimony from victims. Prosecutors have said that a victim identified as "Individual D" in court records may testify at the hearing as well as Jolene Burdge, the sister of the late Stephen Reinboldt. Burdge has said Hastert abused her brother in the 1970s. 
Will Hastert apologize? He must if he wants Durkin to show mercy. So far, his apologies have come only through his lawyers. In a past court appearance Hastert has read from a prepared statement. 
The hearing will no doubt describe dueling portraits of the man. Here's our story in Politico: <<link>>
