Adding Up Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s Campaign Proposals So Far=20
May 2, 2016
=C2=A0
Read the analysis=2E
Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary=
Clinton has proposed numerous new policies that would increase spendin=
g and expand tax breaks along with other policies that would increase t=
axes and reduce certain spending=2E
Using independent estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO),=
the non-partisan Tax Policy Center (TPC), and others, we estimate that=
Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s proposals would cost $1=2E8 trillion over =
a decade with interest, and they would be nearly fully paid for with $1=
=2E6 trillion of offsets =E2=80=93 primarily from taxes on high earners=
=2E The $200 billion shortfall from Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s proposa=
ls would be more than fully covered by the $275 billion of revenue from=
business tax reform that the Clinton campaign has called for but has n=
ot yet provided enough detail for us to credit=2E
Though Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s policies would not substantially add=
to current law debt levels, it would keep debt at post-war record-high=
and rapidly growing levels=2E Under Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s propos=
als, debt held by the public would climb from 74 percent of Gross Domes=
tic Product (GDP) at the end of last year to 86 percent of GDP by 2026=2E
Since the 2016 presidential campaign began, the Committee for a Respons=
ible Federal Budget has analyzed several campaign proposals through our=
=C2=A0Fiscal FactCheck=C2=A0project=2E This analysis of Secretary Clint=
on=E2=80=99s policies is our fourth full assessment of a candidate=E2=80=
=99s proposals available on their campaign=E2=80=99s website (Read our =
analysis of the policies put forth by=C2=A0Senator Ted Cruz,=C2=A0Donal=
d Trump, and=C2=A0Senator Bernie Sanders)=2E We aimed to assess all maj=
or policy proposals on www=2EHillaryClinton=2Ecom as of May 2, 2016, in=
corporating comments and details provided by representatives of the cam=
paign=2E We excluded smaller initiatives and those with too little deta=
il to assess=2E Secretary Clinton may support additional policy changes=
that are not listed on her website or have only been alluded to but no=
t specified=2E We intend to follow up with further analyses of the cand=
idate's plans, including updates to our analysis of Secretary Clinton=E2=
=80=99s proposals, as more details are added to all the candidates' web=
sites=2E Estimates provided in this analysis are both rough and rounded=
=2E
It is encouraging that Secretary Clinton has outlined specific offsets =
for her new proposals=2E By our estimates, these savings would cover ne=
arly all the new costs (and may more than fully cover the costs once th=
e campaign releases specifics for business tax reform)=2E Paying for ne=
w initiatives is an important and necessary step to ensuring the nation=
=E2=80=99s fiscal health does not further deteriorate=2E
While Secretary Clinton would not worsen the fiscal situation, she also=
unfortunately does not offer concrete proposals for improving it=2E As=
under current law, under Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s proposals the nat=
ional debt would ascend from 74 percent of GDP at the end of last year =
=E2=80=93 already a record high other than the period around World War =
II =E2=80=93 to 86 percent of GDP by 2026=2E Secretary Clinton also has=
not set aside money for sequester relief, even though the campaign has=
put forward the goal of reversing both the automatic defense and non-d=
efense cuts, known as "sequester=2E" If full discretionary sequester re=
lief were enacted without offsetting the cost, the debt would climb eve=
n higher to about 90 percent of GDP=2E
In order to pay for sequester relief and put debt on a more sustainable=
path, Secretary Clinton would need to propose significant additional t=
ax increases and/or spending cuts=2E By ruling out many changes to Soci=
al Security as well as tax increases on those making less than $250,000=
, Secretary Clinton has made this task far more difficult=2E Even so, g=
iven that her proposals are largely paid for, it remains possible for S=
ecretary Clinton to offer a viable deficit reduction plan, and we encou=
rage her to do so=2E
The Budgetary Impact of Secretary Clinton's Proposals
Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s campaign website includes a long list of ne=

In addition to these policies, Secretary Clinton has called for ending =

re time, at which point we will assess their fiscal impact=2E
By our estimate, Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s new costs will total rough=
ly $1=2E8 trillion over a decade =E2=80=93 including nearly $1=2E55 tri=
llion of new spending, less than $0=2E2 trillion of tax breaks, and $0=2E=
05 trillion in interest=2E These costs would be largely offset by about=
$1=2E3 trillion of tax increases, $0=2E2 trillion of spending reforms,=
and $0=2E1 trillion of savings from immigration reform=2E In total, th=
is would increase the debt by about $200 billion over the next decade, =
an increase that would be more than offset by the $275 billion of reven=

s Plans
Secretary Clinton deserves credit for not only committing to pay for al=
l new initiatives, but largely meeting this goal=2E However, by not set=
ting aside any substantial savings for deficit reduction, Secretary Cli=
nton would still allow debt to grow significantly as a share of the eco=

ready the highest in U=2ES=2E history other than around World War II =E2=

tary Clinton=E2=80=99s policies and under current law, debt would grow =
to twice its average over the last half-century of roughly 40 percent o=
f GDP; and it would continue to grow unsustainably after that=2E
Were Secretary Clinton to repeal the discretionary spending sequester w=
ithout offsets (she has set forth the goal of repealing sequester but n=
ot yet identified offsets), debt would grow even higher =E2=80=93 to ab=
out 90 percent of GDP by 2026=2E
=C2=A0
In order to meet her goal of fully reversing the discretionary sequeste=
r while also stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio, Secretary Clinton would=
need to identify over $4 trillion in additional budget savings (includ=
ing interest) over 10 years=2E Achieving this level of savings on top o=
f the offsets Secretary Clinton has already proposed would require aggr=
essive tax increases or spending cuts, particularly since she has ruled=
out increasing taxes on households making less than $250,000 as well a=
s a variety of potential Social Security changes=2E For example, to sta=
bilize the debt and repeal the sequester, Secretary Clinton could:
Increase tax rates on households above $250,000 by about 23 percentage =
points,=C2=A0pushing the top combined federal tax rate to 70 percent=C2=
=A0on incomes above $5 million (which would be close to or above=C2=A0t=

Adopt all the tax increases and mandatory savings in President Obama=E2=

ch would=C2=A0move the top rate to 59 percent=C2=A0on incomes above $5 =

Apply an=C2=A0across-the-board 5 point tax increase=C2=A0on all househo=

Reduce mandatory spending while exempting Social Security with a=C2=A01=

Adopt all the tax increases and mandatory savings in President Obama=E2=

urity by=C2=A09 percent across the board=2E
Faster economic growth could also make it easier for Secretary Clinton =
to stabilize the debt and pay for the sequester=2E Based on CBO's estim=
ates of the effect of the 2013 Senate-passed immigration bill and the m=
acroeconomic feedback analysis from the Tax Foundation (which estimates=
that Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s tax increases would=C2=A0reduce=C2=A0=
the size of the economy by 1 percent over a decade),we determined that =
annual real economic growth of about=C2=A03=2E1 percent=C2=A0would be s=
ufficient to pay for sequester repeal and stabilize the debt at last ye=
ar=E2=80=99s level (74 percent of GDP)=2E This is significantly higher =
than the 2=2E1 percent growth projected under current law, and would be=
=C2=A0unlikely to materialize=C2=A0given historical precedent, producti=
vity trends, the aging population, and the impact Secretary Clinton=E2=80=
=99s tax increases would have on long-term economic growth=2E
Conclusion
Secretary Clinton should be commended for not only committing to pay fo=
r her new initiatives but for offering serious and specific proposals t=
hat would more or less achieve this goal=2E However, with debt at post-=
war record high levels and projected to grow unsustainably, simply rema=
ining on our current course is not enough=2E Secretary Clinton would ne=
ed over $4 trillion of deficit reduction to simply replace the sequeste=
r and stabilize the debt at its current high levels=2E So far she has p=
roposed over $1=2E5 trillion of savings, and yet does not dedicate even=
a fraction of it to putting the debt on a more sustainable path=2E
Ultimately, a mixture of spending cuts, tax increases, and entitlement =
reform is likely to be necessary in order to grow the economy and fix t=
he debt for future generations=2E We hope Secretary Clinton will pursue=
these policies going forward, putting new ideas on the table rather th=
an simply taking ideas off=2E Paying for new initiatives is a good star=
t, but much more must be done=2E
