Hey Sri, in an effort to be considerate of Neera Tanden's time, we are hoping to receive confirmation from you by COB tomorrow if possible. We do understand that Tina has other obligations on the 27th, so if it does not work, no problem.
Please let us know as soon as possible if Tina is available to fly in the morning of the 27th (or the evening before) and fly out early afternoon. Per your last message, we are happy to get her back to DC by that evening.
Thank you for your consideration on this.
