Hi Geoff
Like Phil, I've just given this a quick read through and there are only a
very few minor comments on the attached.
My main concern is the cost - which I have to say is much higher than I
was anticipating. But we are proposing a substantial amount of analysis
and work....
Thanks for all your work on this and good luck getting it off tomorrow.
Best wishes, Clare
