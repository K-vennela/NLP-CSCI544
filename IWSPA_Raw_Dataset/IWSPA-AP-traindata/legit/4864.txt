Chuck-
I hope all is well.
Next week, David Simas (Senior Advisor to the President) will be in Chicago on Thursday, May 19th and the morning of Friday, May 20th. Do you have any time to see him on either day? This is an opportunity for him to see some of our top folks in the area and catch up with them.
Please let me know if you can accommodate.
Thank you!
Clayton
