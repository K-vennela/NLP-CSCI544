thanks Tim,
I'm saddened to hear that this bozo is bothering you too, in addition to 
NCAR, NSF, NAS, IPCC and everyone else. Rest assured that I  won't ever 
respond to McIntyre should he ever contact me, but I will forward you 
any email he sends related to this. I assume Scott feels the same way...
I hope you're having as nice a spring as we are here. See you in June?

p.s. we have some interesting new reconstructionbased on RegEM using a 
greatly expanded multiproxy network (which includes the MXD data).  I 
hope to send you guys shortly. It is our hope that you'll consider being 
co-authors. This to come soon...
