Dear coauthors of the Santer et al. International Journal of Climatology 
paper (and other interested parties),
I have now publicly released the synthetic MSU tropical lower 
tropospheric temperatures that were the subject of Mr. Stephen 
McIntyre's request to the U.S. Dept. of Energy/National Nuclear Security 
Agency under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). I have also 
released additional synthetic MSU temperatures which were not requested 
by Mr. McIntyre. These synthetic MSU datasets are available on PCMDI's 
publicly-accessible website. The link to the datasets is:

Technical information about the synthetic MSU datasets is provided in a 
document entitled:
"Information regarding synthetic Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) 
temperatures calculated from CMIP-3 archive"
The link to the technical document is:
<<link>>
I hope that these datasets will prove useful for bona fide scientific 
research, and will be employed for such purposes only.
I am also hopeful that after publication of these datasets, I will be 
able to return to full-time research, unencumbered by further FOIA 
requests from Mr. McIntyre. In my opinion, Mr. McIntyre's FOIA requests 
are for the purpose of harassing Government scientists, and not for the 
purpose of improving our understanding of the nature and causes of 
climate change.
I'd like to thank Dave Bader, Bill Goldstein, and Pat Berge for helping 
me complete the process of reviewing, releasing, and publishing the 
synthetic MSU datasets and the technical document. And thanks to all of 
you for your support and encouragement over the past two months. It is 
deeply appreciated.
With best regards,
Ben
