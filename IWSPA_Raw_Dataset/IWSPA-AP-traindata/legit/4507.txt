TeenScreen's PR machine got an article published in
the Las Vegas Sun newspaper. The fine people of Las
Vegas have thus been deluged with false data on
TeenScreen, screening in general and the opposition to
it.
It's now our responsibility to set it right.
Need some letters.
This is a pretty crappy article with really no
redeeming qualities. If you'd rather not read it, then
don't. Write your letter using any one of the points
of this petition to prove that TeenScreen is bad news:
www.petitiononline.com/TScreen/petition.html
If your last name ends in T, put the petition link in
your letter.
Send your letter to user@domain.com
If you do read the letter, then pick out some huge
outpoint and attack it very thoroughly. Use documents
if you have them. Don't cut them any slack at all. And
if I were you I would personally attack and insult the
reporter who is just a TeenScreen stooge.
If your last name ends in M-P, I suggest that you
attack this point, the final statement in the letter,
"The alternative is doing nothing, and how many
children has that helped?"
You can attack that a dozen ways. First off, doing
nothing is not the only choice. You can get kids
healthy, give them a safe school environment, keep
them away from drugs, and put in some good instruction
so they will actually learn. Also, doing nothing has
helped billions, I'd say. Children grew up and lived
productive lives long before psychiatry's intrusive
ways. And curiously, only the ones treated by
psychiatry ever seem to commit suicide. I'd say "doing
nothing" is a fine alterative to TeenScreen.
Have fun with this one.
Report compliance by email.
Thank you,
