Dear Tom,
I'm inclined to agree with Mike. Some people are accessible to rational 
scientific debate. They are good Bayesians - when confronted with new 
scientific information, they are capable of modifying previously-held 
views. John Christy is not accessible to rational scientific debate. New 
evidence does not cause him to change his views. He simply claims that 
the new evidence is wrong. From John's perspective, any datasets in 
disagreement with UAH-based estimates of tropospheric temperature change 
constitute "bad data".
John is incapable of recognizing and admitting that Douglass et al. used 
a flawed statistical test to reach incorrect conclusions. He continues 
to misrepresent the analyses we performed in our response to Douglass et 
al. I don't see what useful purpose can be served by trying to engage 
him in reasonable scientific debate.
At the Hawaii IPCC meeting in March, John stood up in front of an 
audience of IPCC Working Group I Lead Authors and attempted to portray 
himself as a victim of scientific discrimination. He claimed that his 
"alternative" views on the nature and causes of climate change were 
being ignored by the mainstream scientific community. This claim is 
bogus. The "mainstream" scientific community has not ignored the 
"alternative" views of folks like John Christy. The sad reality is that 
we've wasted an inordinate amount of time responding to the flawed 
science and incorrect claims of John and his colleagues.
I'm hopeful that I won't have to waste much more time on the "great 
satellite debate". In my personal opinion, we're already well past the 
point of diminishing returns on this debate. The point of diminishing 
returns was reached three years ago, when you overcame great obstacles 
to lead a fractious bunch of scientists to the successful completion of 
the first CCSP Report.
With best regards,
Ben
