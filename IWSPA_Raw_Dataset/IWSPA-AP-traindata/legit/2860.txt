Hi Henry - excellent feedback, thanks. I think it 
should be easy for Valerie (Holocene issues in 
6.5) and Keith/Tim.Ricardo (last 2k, section 6.6) 
to deal with the 'expert' review issues regarding 
this paper. It sounds to me like that is the 
place for discussion of this paper, rather than 
in the text itself. BUT, it is important that the 
responses to review comments be thorough and 
convincing - Valerie and Keith - please update 
your responses in this respect.
thanks all, Peck
