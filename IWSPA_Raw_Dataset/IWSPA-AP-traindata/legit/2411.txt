I'll let you in on a little secret. Ohio is the most
active nest of TeenScreening psychs in the country.
This is partially true because a suppressive named
Michael Hogan is in charge of the Ohio Department of
Mental Health. Hogan is also one of TeenScreen's major
henchmen, being so dirty that he was given a
"Leadership Award" by TeenScreen last year.
Your assignment:
Write a letter to the editor of the Mansfield (Ohio)
News-Journal and let the fine people of Mansfield know
the truth about TeenScreen.
