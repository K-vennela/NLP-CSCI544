Jordan -- TIMELY!!  Carol P. and I were ready  to send this draft letter (be=
low)to Senator Gillibrand tomorrow asking her and her organization "Off the s=
idelines",  to cohost an event with WLF at the convention.
However, I had also reached out last week to Jae Kim, a friend of mine and f=
ormer WLF member now living in Vancouver, if she would feel comfortable cont=
acting her best friend, Ahmal Clooney, to see if she might be part of this e=
vent.
Jae called me today to say that she spoke to Ahmal,  that George has been in=
vited to speak at Convention, (hasn't accepted yet, but  he's thinking it's t=
oo important not to. . . ) and that if he accepts the speaking role, they wo=
uld both consider being our special guests at this event. (great news!!)  Th=
ey also met Kirsten, are impressed with her, and would like to do something t=
ogether with her.
Jae is aware of WLF's importance at the Convention , doesn't want EMILY and E=
MERGE to steal all the limelight. .! . and conveyed info about WLF to the  C=
looneys.
Clooneys have asked for a fact sheet about the potential event to be emailed=
to their personal assistant next week. (Jae will send me contact info)
We need your help right away, Jordan, to carry this event idea further to t=
he DNC,
to Inform DWS ,get her ok, etc.=20
NOTE:  we feel it's important that  event be co-hosted by WLF, not the Women=
's Caucus or Debbie's umbrella women's organization, though all should be in=
vited and welcome at this reception.
I will amend my email to Kirsten tomorrow to include the outreach and possib=
ility of the Clooneys coming on board.
Also, Lottie Shackleford -- She  contacted Carol and me originally about pla=
nning an event.  I would like to bring her into planning stage soon as we ge=
t sign-off from you.
what else??=20
Thanks, Jordan!  This would be a high -Profile event for all women at the Co=
nvention and on TV!
Call me if you wish, including over the weekend.
