ST 1st Class Herring,
I enjoyed talking to you as well, one thing I forgot to mention was that I
can tell you are a true believer, that is why you see things so seriously,
unlike some of the others who have excuses on everything as to why they
cannot commit to actions, etc. I am also a true believer, and I am well
aware of the importance of Oaths, that is why I chose that term, its dead
serious. The weak are but driftwood or kindling on the pyre's. 88 Commander
Schoep  ps.. Send me that cell phone # before our trip, so I can program it
in my phone. 88
