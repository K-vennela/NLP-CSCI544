*Announcement: NSM Wisconsin to hold Public Meeting in Milwaukee area*
In Honor of the Nov. 9th National Socialist Martyrs, The National Socialist
Movement and its Wisconsin Division will hold a Public meeting in the
Milwaukee area on the afternoon of Nov. 10th. Many issues will be covered
including illegal immigration, crime, the NSM 2008 Presidential Campaign,
and other important issues that concern the American people. The meeting
will feature speeches by various NSM Leaders, including Commander Schoep
and others, to be announced. Public meetings are held on Public property and
will be open to all members of the Public. We will also hold a question and
answer session with the Public after the speeches. If you have questions for
or about the NSM and our Political activism, this would be a good time to
come out and hear us directly and in person. This is grass roots activism in
action, be there!
