Thanks so much for your reply. I will check. But I also was wanting to know if there was by any chance an NSM office in Virginia and do they help out with transportation like busses or something if we cannot drive to all of the events NSM have. I remember seeing a link to a website but it didn't show up. Are they doing some type of maintenance on the site. Also one of the others interested is my grandfather in his 60s, he is German and supports a lot of the ideas as myself. He wants to know if you are beyond a certain age are you allowed to still join or do you have to just fill out a supporter application. 
I would actually like to march in public with you all in a uniformed division, but on the application the divisions are;  NSM, Women's Division, Stormtrooper Division, Skinhead division, Viking Division and Farmers' Association. So I don't have any specific type of skills but would love to spread the truth and words to others and draw them to the NSM. This is how I would be able to help also by support. Hopefully that would be enough. I do not mind devoting time to the NSM if I were to join. I will check out the contacts and units now. Thanks again.
