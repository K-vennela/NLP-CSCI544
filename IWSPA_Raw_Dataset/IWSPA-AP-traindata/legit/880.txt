Colin,
I thought that this didn't happen.
Cheers
Phil

Hi Chris,
Another Weather Generator query for you. It was raised by Richard Watkins of Manchester
University (and COPSE project) following a visit from Roger yesterday.
Can you let me know your response please?
Cheers,
Lyndsey
Long Description=The hourly data from the Weather
Generator have discontinuities at each
midnight join. The e.g. temperature
jumps, may be as high as 9ï¿½C. The
hourly data seem to have been generated
independently for each day, rather than
fitting a curve from the maximum of one
day to the minimum of the next. The
minimum to maximum curve, i.e. within
each day, is fine.
Could the Weather Generator be altered
to produce more realistic hourly data
by fitting from Tmax to Tmin the
following day, please? This would be
helpful particularly for any use of the
data for building simulation with plant
controls.
Thanks,
Richard Watkins
