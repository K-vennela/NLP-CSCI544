Dear Colleagues,
Zhou Dadi has been kind enough to organize the next SRES Lead Authors
meeting in Beijing, China, to be held on 7-9 October, 1998.  Dadi will
provide us with more detailed information on meeting logistics in the near
future, and I will send out a meeting agenda as we get closer to the
meeting date.  Basically, there are four items that need to be discussed at
the meeting:  1) SRES progress to date; 2) the open process; 3) scenario
revisions and additional work; and 4) planning the final report.
Please mark you calendars for this date and RSVP to both Zhou Dadi
(user@domain.com.cn) and Anne Johnson (johnson@iiasa.ac.at) as soon
as possible I will be out of the office 10-26 September and will not be
able to receive messages during this time.
I look forward to seeing you in Beijing.
Naki
