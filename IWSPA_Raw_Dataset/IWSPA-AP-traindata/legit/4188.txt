I will definitely be attending the Wisconsin event. However, I checked the =
Greyhound schedule and its a 23 hour bus trip. That is not really doable. C=
an't afford to be out of work for a whole extra day sitting on a bus. Howev=
er, if yourself and the Minneapolis unit will be carpooling, I could certai=
nly share in the expenses. I would come to Minneapolis on the evening of th=
e 8th, find a motel and meet up with you the following morning. I assume th=
at you will be leaving the day before. In any event let me know if this is =
feasable and what your proposed departure date is and I will adjust my plan=
s accordingly. Because Ian is still so young, Angela will not be attending.=
If he were a bit older, we would just drive, but neiter of us feel that it=
is a good idea to take an infant on a 500 mile trip. I am sure you would a=
gree. Looking forward to this event!                                       =
