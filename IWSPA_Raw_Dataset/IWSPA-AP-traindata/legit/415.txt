Hey there friend!
I'll be in DC and the DNC office next week and will check in with YOU!
I thought I would first ask a quick convention question.
I think the last time I was in the office I asked if I could get a couple
of hotel rooms in your block.
At the time you thought it wouldn't be a problem - is this still possible?
If yes, who on your team can I work with to figure out the details?
Thank you sir and see you soon!!!  -LisaG
