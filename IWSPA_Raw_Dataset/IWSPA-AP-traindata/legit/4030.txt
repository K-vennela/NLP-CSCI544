Dear Mr. Matthews,
I have not read the criticism on the website you refer to, but will add to Mike Mann's
response in a small, but hopefully helpful, way.
Comparison of the Mann and Jones proxy-based reconstruction with instrumental temperature
data *is* a valid comparison to make, provided that the reconstruction is *calibrated* to
represent the instrumental record and provided that the *uncertainties* in the calibration
are taken into account when making the comparison.
That is, after all, the purpose of calibration - to allow two different data sets to be
compared!
As is clear from their article, Mann and Jones do undertake a careful calibration and only
make comparisons after the calibration, and their comparison figure includes their
estimated uncertainty range.  Thus the conclusions they draw (regarding whether recent
warming is unprecedented) are valid and are supported by their analysis.
This does not mean that future work, perhaps using new proxy records or different methods
for calibration or for estimating calibration uncertainties, will not change those
conclusions.  But it remains true that their conclusions are supported by their analysis.
As an example of a poor comparison, see the piece by Fred Pearce on page 5 of 12 July 2003
issue of New Scientist.  This is a short news article about the Mann and Jones paper, and
it unfortunately shows a comparison figure without the associated calibration
uncertainties.  That is not a good comparison.  I mention this in case you were thinking of
including a diagram in your article, perhaps showing the Mann and Jones results.  If you
do, then it will only be valid for comparing the recent instrumental temperatures with the
proxy-based reconstruction of earlier temperatures if the reconstruction uncertainties are
included.  Try to avoid the mistake that Fred Pearce made.
Regards
Tim
