Dear Tas,
Thanks for the email. Steve McIntyre hasn't contacted me directly about Law Dome
(yet), nor about any of
the series used in the 1998 Holocene paper or the 2003 GRL one with Mike. I suspect (hope)
that he won't. I
had some emails with him a few years ago when he wanted to get all the station temperature
data we use here
in CRU. At that time, I hid behind the fact that some of the data had been received from
individuals and not
directly from Met Services through the Global Telecommunications Service (GTS) or through
GCOS.
I've cc'd Mike on this, just for info. Emails have also been sent to some other paleo
people asking for
datasets used in 1998 or 2003. Keith Briffa here got one, for example. Here, they have
also been in contact with
some of Keith's Russian contacts. All seem to relate to trying to get series we've used.
In the Russian case,
issues relate to the Russian  (Rashit Hantemirov) having a paper out with the same series
Keith used (for the
Yamal Peninsula). Series are different for two reasons. One Keith used the RCS
standardization method
and secondly Rashit has added some series since Keith got the data a couple of years ago.
I'll just sit tight here and do nothing.  Mike will likely do the same, but we'll
expect another publication in
the nearish future.
As for the series for LD you sent us, we used it in the paper for Reviews of
Geophysics. This paper has
had 4 good reviews and we've just sent back a revised version. This will likely get
reviewed by 1 or 2 of
the same reviewers of the editor, but I think it will come out this year some time.  When
it does, we
will put all the series onto a web site. Hope this is OK with you.  It will unlikely be
before our summer
months.
Cheers
Phil
