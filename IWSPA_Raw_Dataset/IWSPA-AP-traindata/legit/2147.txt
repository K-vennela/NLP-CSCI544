Thank you so much for your response!  It is a pleasure "meeting" and "speak=
ing" with you.  I would love to attend one of the rallies you mentioned=2C =
but I will actually be on my honeymoon on that date!  My fiancee and I are =
getting married 11/1/08 and then we are solitude/mountain-bound in New Engl=
and. =20

However=2C I am VERY interested in speaking with you further regarding the =
formation of a strong TN NSM unit.  I do not at the present time know of an=
yone I could COUNT ON joining up along with me=2C but there are a select fe=
w men who teter on the brink.  I'm sure you know how that goes.  It is not =
easy to admit that one is NOT what the government wants them to be=2C there=
fore the widespread fear and intimidation plays a major role in "speaking o=
ut".  I will admit that I do worry about if/when I go public with this that=
I risk losing my job and so forth.  I am compelled to ask what legal ramif=
ications have you seen played out against various unit leaders?  Any answer=
s you provide won't necessarily make me change my decision.  I assure you t=
hat I would not "bumble" when I speak publicly=2C but even elequence doesn'=
t gloss over our frustration in the eyes of the majority of liberally-brain=
washed Americans. =20

What is involved in the process in becoming unit leader here in the great s=
tate of TN?  What is my next step?  I am open to any questions you have abo=
ut me and I almost encourage it so you know exactly where I am coming from =
and feel confident in allowing me the great priviledge of being an integral=
part of your association. =20
