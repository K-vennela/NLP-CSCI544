Hi Glenn -- I hope the slow reviewer is not one that I suggested!  Sorry if it is.  I'm not
sure what Ben Santer expects you to do about it at this stage; I guess you didn't expect
such a lengthy article... I've not seen it, but Phil Jones told me it ran to around 90
pages!  Hope all's well in NZ.  Tim
