Mike,
These were two simple ones to provide. Also Tas told him I had one of them. I guess
these
are the ones that aren't available on web sites.
Anyway, it is done now. If he starts asking for them in dribs and drabs, I'll baulk at
that.
Ben waded in with very positive comments re the CC issue.  Steve's going to find it
very
hard to ask you to send the code. Those that say on the CC board that you should send the
code, have little idea what is involved. Most are on the social science side.
Cheers
Phil
