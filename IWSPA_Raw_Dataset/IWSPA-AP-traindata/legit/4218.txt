David - sounds promising. So, the bottom line is that a little disagreement is ok - that's
a reflection of the real uncertainty? But, the discrepancy is not all that big in the end?
No need to take this to a higher level?
Keith Briffa is back on line and finishing off Section 6.5, so you might want to send him
an email w/ suggestions that help keep chap 6 compatible w/ 2 and 9 - for example, with
respect to solar, we acknowledge the forcing could be less than 0.5 W/m**2, and the
uncertaintly wrt to trop aerosols and land albedo is significant - we could easily be
closer to chap 9's estimate. Would you say the key is that our analysis acknowledge the
uncertainty so as to overlap well with the other chapters?
Keith - please make sure you send your new 6.5 to David too - while you were out, he was
working hard w/ chap 2 and 9 to make sure we (the IPCC) avoid saying things that confuse.
The comparison of radiative forcings from 3 different angles is what assessment is all
about, and it's great David has had the patience to help figure it all out.
Thx, Peck
Hi Gabi,
The key to your proposed solution is the updated numbers from Chapter 2. If indeed the
radiative forcing change to 1750 is -1.53, then presumably you have made this consistent
with the earlier part of Chapter 9. The numbers previously looked like this (I haven't
seen the latest version of 6.5, but I've included the previous estimates we had in the
ZOD):
W/m**2
Chapter 6               Chapter 9
MM              1750
Greenhouse gases:               -2.4            -2.6
TROP aerosols:          0.5             0.2
Solar                   -0.5            -0.1
Volcanic:                       ?               ?
Land albedo:            +0.4            0.03
Trop O3:                        -0.35           -0.4
Strat O3:                       +0.15           0.10
1'st indirect aerosol forcing                   1.2
STRAT H2O                               -0.13
AVIATION                                -0.02
TOTAL                   -2.2            -1.7
There is essentially no change in greenhouse gas forcing from 1750 to 1700 (see for
example Crowley et al., GRL, 2003), so the difference in the estimated numbers is
probably due to inclusion of more things or different choices in Chapter 2. A similar
statement holds for trop aerosols. One can also use these two to presume that the same
also holds true for land albedo. [The value listed for that in Chapter 9 is quite small
compared to some other studies; e.g., Govindasamy et al., GRL, 28, 291-294,2001.] So, to
the extent these numbers are still discussed in Chapter 6, they should be made
consistent with those in chapters 2 and 9.
With respect to your proposed paragraph below: I would drop the comments about trace gas
differences but saying land albedo changes may have been greater, along with the
additional solar change, could give us the -1.8 W/m**2 forcing.
Concerning the temperature response: the Moberg et al paper itself claims 1C difference
between 1500 and 2000, but the figure seems to show a larger number, perhaps 1.3C
(again, just eye-balling it). However, the coldest time period is not in the MM but
before it. I think therefore a better estimate from that paper for the MM would be 1C.
So, with respect to the sensitivity: if 0.85 W/m**2 is unresolved, then we have a total
forcing of ~0.95 W/m**2, and a climate response varying between 0.45C and 1C - or a
climate sensitivity for 2xCO2 of 1.9C to 4.2C, or pretty similar to standard IPCC
estimates.
I think this will work!
David
