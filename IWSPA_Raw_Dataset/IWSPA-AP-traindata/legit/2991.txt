Willam,
NS greetings, we will increase you Rank to ST 1st Class effective now, the Cpl Rank will come later via Party service, perhaps on April 20th, we will see. 
Your NSM patch is being sent a little early, it ships with your most recent order, shirt, etc today/Monday. You earned it Brother, welcome to the Family. You can remove that Probate from your name and change it ST. 1st Class, let the Forum know too so they can pull probate off your status. Don't tell people we took you off it a little early, that will just agitate the other probates so (shhhhh on that) ha ha. 
HQ sends/sells the NSM side of the collar tabs out, to purchase the Rank side contact Col. Bishop, he can let you know where to obtain the Rank side. Same on the cross belts, or try Police supply stores for those (the cross strap is an optional uniform item). 
Are you coming through Minneapolis to travel to Omaha? I am not sure how many are coming with me yet, so far only 2 or 3, but alot of the men still need to be contacted, if we have room and you want to vanpool with us, you are welcome to. I plan to rent a minivan, or larger van if we need one, and with everyone splitting costs, its never very much per person when we travel. 
Omaha is going to rock, wait till you see what we got planned for afterwards, I better start typing that up now. 88 Commander Schoep
