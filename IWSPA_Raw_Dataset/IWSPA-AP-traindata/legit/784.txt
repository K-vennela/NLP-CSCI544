Dear Ben,
well, thanks for your thanks.  I'm not sure that I did all that much, but glad that the
small amount is appreciated.  It's a shame that the process couldn't have been quicker
still, but hopefully the final production stage will pass smoothly.
Thanks for the copy of the paper, which I've skim read already -- looks very carefully done
and therefore convincing (I'm sure you already heard that from others).
I note that you also provide some supporting online material (SOM).  Provision of SOM is a
relatively new facility for IJoC to offer and it may be suffering from teething problems.
A paper of mine (Maraun et al.) that appeared online in IJoC back in February still has its
SOM missing!  Hopefully this is a one-off omission, but I'll now email Glenn to remind him
of this in relation to my paper and also point out that your paper has SOM.  I think this
is a problem on the publisher's side of things rather than an editorial problem.
Because of our absent SOM, we've temporarily posted a copy of the SOM on our personal
website.  If your SOM was delayed, and if you think that critics might complain if the
paper appears without the SOM, you might want to post a copy of the SOM on your own website
when the paper appears online.  But hopefully there'll be no problem with it!
I heard you had a recent trip to Australia for Tom's wedding -- hope that was fun!
Best regards
Tim
