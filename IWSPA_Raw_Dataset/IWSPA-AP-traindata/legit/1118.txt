SS Herring,
Are you keeping up on the staff mails I send (remember I said I would ask
every so often)?
I have been able to keep up on most of them, but here is one for you. This
guy actually sent a letter in super long, and I don't have time to answer
his million questions. He sounds like a good guy, but he is really worried
about zog finding out if he joins us. Name is Brooks Batson from Oregon, his
e-mail is user@domain.com  Please contact him as NSM HQ Staff and see
if you can answer his questions please. He is a long time member of the
Council of Conservative Citizens but is looking for a more serious group
(like us), he sent in 3 typed pages. Alright thanks again.
It was good seeing you and your Family at the MO. Rally, always a pleasure.
