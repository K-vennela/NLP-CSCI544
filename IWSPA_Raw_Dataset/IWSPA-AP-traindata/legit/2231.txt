Wow
Hi Steve!
SO this weekend we filmed one of our favorite songs from the show we are currently closing at the theatre, it's an uodated version of the Three Little Pigs.  And I thought I might give you a glimpse of what it is we do.  It's not Broadway quality, but the kids love it and we have tons of fun doing it.  So please chuckle away and enjoy!
