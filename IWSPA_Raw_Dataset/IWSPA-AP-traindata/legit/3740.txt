SIEG HEIL to all of you.I really appreciate the response and the advice.I really need your help on something else,this is probably a waiste of your time,but i am having an extremely hard time trying to get our names and other stuff written out in Luftwaffe and printed.We have tried everything.This one site let us download the alphabet and let us write anything we wanted but would not let us print it and then took it away.If you know of any site that we could go on it would be greatly appreciated,my 3 man crew is waiting for their jackets.Please keep us updated of any events marches concerts ect.Our applications will be there soon.Thankyou.
