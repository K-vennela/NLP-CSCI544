Hi Keith - in our TS/SPM discussions, Susan has raised this question:
"In the TAR they spoke of 1998 being the warmest year in the 
millennium and the 1990s the warmest decade.   I don't see that 
chapter 6 addresses any of these time scales.   I am not saying you 
should do so - but are you planning to say anything about it and why 
you aren't doing so?   and if you're not planning to say anything at 
all, can you please tell me what you think about it, just for my own 
info?"
Would you please give me your feedback on this, with enough 
thoughtful detail to hopefully make me/Susan fully informed (a para 
should be enough).
Thanks, Peck
