Wonderful, thank you for responding. I do put a lot of work into tracing my
Genealogy.
I will send in my application after I take care of some business of getting
into college and working out some family property issues. I'm probably going
to get a car before I join, so I can get to rallies in neighbouring states.
Many thanks, keep up the good work.
