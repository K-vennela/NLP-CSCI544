While Wheeler and current Mayor Charlie Hales are saying the right things about a cordial transition, they have a frayed relationship and haven't spoken - beyond trading voicemails - since Tuesday's primary election.

ELECTION CLIPS
2016 - Presidential
Democratic Party Candidates
Hillary Clinton
Hillary Clinton Now Loses to Trump in Polls. Bernie Sanders Beats Trump by 10.8 Points.<<<link>>>
Donald Trump, the man viewed to be the reincarnation of Hitler by some people, beats Hillary Clinton in three out of five national polls. The former Secretary of State is now losing to Donald Trump, in an average of polls, by .2 points. Although a bit more optimistic, HuffPost Pollster shows Clinton only up by 1.6 points over Trump. On April 15, 2016 Hillary Clinton was up by around 10 points, and on June 24th of last year, Trump trailed Clinton by about 20 points. The big issue with Clinton is that she doesn't keep polling leads, and Election Day is over five months away. In contrast, HuffPost Pollster shows Bernie Sanders defeating Trump in a general election by 10.2 points.
Why Conservatives Should Vote for Hillary Clinton<<<link>>>
Republican unifiers warn that if Democrats capture the presidency, and, even more ominously, the Senate, the legislative and political mischief they will propagate may pale in comparison to the more lasting damage progressives could inflict on the judiciary. If elected, Hillary Clinton undoubtedly would appoint young progressive justices to the court in an effort to control the legal agenda long after she leaves office, but conservative voters should seriously consider voting for her anyway. The dangers a Trump presidency would pose for foreign policy (isolationism) and economic prosperity (trade wars) outweigh the constitutional distortions that would continue with a Democratic administration. Moreover, there are no guarantees that Trump would appoint a principled conservative to the court even if he were elected president.
Bernie Sanders
Bernie Sanders' supporters sue California over primary rules<<<link>>>
Supporters of Sen. Bernard Sanders in California have filed a federal lawsuit to extend voter registration for the state's June 7 primary, as the Democrats' nominating fight drags on to the bitter end. The lawsuit claims election officials are not doing enough to publicize that the Democratic primary is open to independent voters, who have favored Mr. Sanders throughout his challenge to Hillary Clinton, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Bernie Loses His Halo<<<link>>>
Is the left turning on its darling, Bernie Sanders? On Friday, Netroots titan Markos Moulitsas, namesake of the liberal Daily Kos, dropped a rhetorical bomb on the Bern, blaming the candidate for doing too little to denounce death threats received by the Nevada Democratic Party after Sanders' state convention delegates complained they had received unfair treatment. "The problem isn't Bernie Sanders' supporters," Moulitsas wrote. "It's Bernie Sanders himself ... [He] refuses to forcefully and unambiguously reject that violence, instead rationalizing and explaining it away with a mix of grievances and outright conspiracy theory."
Bernie Sanders digs in<<<link>>>
The stakes of Bernie Sanders' take-it-to-the-convention strategy are rapidly rising as fresh polls underscore Hillary Clinton's vulnerabilities and predict a tight race between her and Donald Trump in the fall. After months of talk about the potential of a contested Republican convention, Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, is quickly consolidating his party's support -- something Clinton is unable to do with Sanders still in the race.
Bernie Sanders Steps Up Feud With Democratic Establishment<<<link>>>
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders cranked up his fight with party leaders on Sunday, backing a challenger to the Democratic National Committee's chairwoman and accusing the party's establishment of trying to anoint Hillary Clinton as the nominee for president. In a series of television interviews, Sanders remained defiant despite what he acknowledged was an uphill fight to overtake front-runner Clinton.
Republican Party Candidates
Donald Trump
Taking Trump seriously: His jump in polls against Hillary changes the media mindset<<<link>>>
Suddenly, abruptly, the press is viewing Donald Trump as a potential president. The business that gave him no chance of winning the nomination, which remained in denial for months as he dispatched his GOP rivals, which has been operated under the assumption that Hillary Clinton will clobber him, is starting to change its tune. And it's all because of a couple of polls.
Donald Trump denies climate change--but fears it could hurt his golf course<<<link>>>
Donald Trump has said he doesn't believe in man-made climate change and has called global warming a "hoax," but he's trying to protect a golf course he owns on the coast of Ireland from its effects. The presumptive GOP nominee applied for a permit to build a seawall next to Trump International Golf Links & Hotel Ireland in County Clare to prevent erosion, according to Politico. His application included an environmental impact statement that explicitly mentions "global warming and its effects." According to Politico's report, that statement says that rising sea levels in that region could accelerate erosion. The statement cited a study by the Irish government predicting a steady rate of erosion through 2050, but the statement says that the study failed to take climate change into consideration.
In Swing State Suburbs, White Women Are Skeptical of Donald Trump<<<link>>>
For Donald Trump to win the White House in November, he'll need the votes of women like Elizabeth Andrus. Yet Andrus, a registered Republican from Delaware, Ohio, sees "buffoonery" in the presumptive Republican nominee and says "I am not on the Trump train." With all the trouble in the world, she went on, "you just don't want Donald Trump as president." Her negative impression of Trump was shared by most of the dozens of white, suburban women from politically important states who were interviewed by The Associated Press this spring. Their views are reflected in opinion polls, such as a recent AP-GfK survey that found 70% of women have unfavorable opinions of Trump.
Donald Trump's 'shady' support for veterans<<<link>>>
When Democrats make the case that Donald Trump has a controversial background when it comes to veterans' issues, it's not just wishful thinking. The presumptive Republican nominee, for example, has drawn criticism for supporting a privatization plan for veterans' care. His associations with the sketchy Veterans for a Strong America exacerbated the problem. And it certainly didn't help matters when Trump, who avoided military service during the Vietnam War, said he "felt" like he'd served in the military because his parents sent him to a military-themed boarding school as a teenager. The Republican went so far as to boast that his expensive prep school gave him "more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military." Making matters much worse are new questions about Trump and veterans-related fundraising.
Juan Williams: Electoral map looks grim for Trump<<<link>>>
Donald Trump is getting good news in the polls. Last week, a Fox News poll saw him take a 3-point lead over Hillary Clinton in a national survey. That's within the margin of error. But step back and take the long view. Clinton led by seven points in April. If this is a horse race, Trump is clearly coming on fast. Even after last week's surprising polls, Clinton still led in the RealClearPolitics nationwide average by 3 points as of last Friday. But that makes the race a toss-up - her big lead is gone.
