New DOL FLSA Overtime Rule Issued:
Employer Costs Likely to Increase in the Near Future
Step-by-step guidance through the
new FLSA overtime regulation revisions
=09
The Department of Labor has now issued its long awaited revised overtime re=
gulations to the Fair Labor Standards Act. The last major revisions to the =
FLSA were in 2004 and employers have been operating under these standards s=
ince then. The revisions reflect a significant change in how employers can =
determine which employees are exempt and which employees will now be entitl=
ed to overtime. One thing that won't change, however: failure to be in comp=
liance with the new requirements when they take effect can result in signif=
icant liability for an employer.=A0
=09
We'll cover:
=09
In-depth overview of the new overtime rule and what it means for employers.
The significance of the new revised regulations with regard to how many add=
itional employees will now be entitled to overtime pay.
Changes with regard to the salary level test for determining who is an exem=
pt employee that will now make many more employees eligible for overtime.
And more!
=09
Please join Melissa Fleischer, attorney at law, as she provides in-depth an=
alysis of the new FLSA overtime rule and how employers should implement the=
changes to help protect them from liability for misclassification of emplo=
yees. In addition, Ms. Fleischer will discuss the amount of overtime employ=
ers may be required to pay under the new overtime rules to employees who we=
re previously classified as exempt and not entitled to overtime.
