Dear Tas and Caspar,
Attached is the proof version of the RoG paper with Mike Mann. This is about 99.99%
the final one. Mike and I sent back a few small changes to AGU a month or so ago. Keep
this to yourself for a while yet - I would expect the paper out sometime in the
July/August
period.
Many of us in the paleo field get requests from skeptics (mainly a guy called
Steve McIntyre in Canada) asking us for series. Mike and I are not sending anything,
partly because we don't have some of the series he wants, also partly as we've got the
data
through contacts like you, but mostly because he'll distort and misuse them.
Despite this, Mike and I would like to make as many of the series we've used in the
RoG
plots available from the CRU web page. Can we do this with the series we've got from
you?  You don't have to do anything, except to reply yes or no !
Cheers
Phil
