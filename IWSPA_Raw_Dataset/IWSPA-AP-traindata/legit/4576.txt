Darrell (from AGU Toronto):
Great news from Science!
A quick comment on Amplification and signal to noise issues (comment 
1 below).  It think you meant that the referee felt that Arctic 
amplificaton did not translate to a more robust signal because the 
noise would be equally amplified.  I don't know that we can challenge 
the "climate noise" but we can make the case that the "proxy noise", 
that is, the uncertainty in proxy calibration, is, as far as I know, 
the same in the Arctic as in lower latitudes.  Consequently, the 
larger temperature signal expected in the Arctic can be more reliably 
detected by our proxies because it is more likely to exceed the 
sensitivity limits of our proxies.  If we assume the "climate noise" 
is more or less gaussian, then we should be better able to detect the 
relatively subtle temp changes of the Holocene in the Arctic than 
elsewhere.
