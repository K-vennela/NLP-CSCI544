Dear Tony and Michael,
The final draft of the letter to the Times is attached, incorperating
your changes (I hope I have combined them in a way that you are both
happy with). 
Brian Hoskins and Adrian Jenkins have both decided that they prefer not
to sign the letter, although agreeing with its message. I haven't been
able to contact anyone else in the short time available, so I leave it
up to you to decide whether you are still both happy to go ahead.
If so, Mike could you please reply to both Tony and myself and let us
know, and Tony could you then send it as agreed?
Thank you both very much for your time and trouble.
Best regards,
Helen
