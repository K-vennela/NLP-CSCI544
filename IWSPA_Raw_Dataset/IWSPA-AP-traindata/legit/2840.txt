Hi Keith -
1) ok on the refs - send tomorrow
2) glad you're keen for the box - it can't be too long - maybe shot 
for ca. 400 words? After the ZOD is done, I'm sure we can tune to the 
correct balance of info. A fig is ok if it's compelling. The box will 
either be 6.1 or 6.2 depending on whether you refer to it in your 
section before or after the glacier box. I'm guessing it'll be 6.1 
and come first, but it's your call. Think of a title for the box - 
something like "Box 6.1: The Medieval Warm Period" or maybe something 
more catchy. Can't be too glib.
3) glad you have some borehole in there. Of course, you'll be at the 
front of the line for dealing with the grief we get no matter what 
choice we make. So the key is to go with what can be best justified. 
Your section has this nice balance already.
Thanks for getting Tim (and you as time permits) to work on those 
other sections - VERY important too. But, your section is the most 
important.
thx, Peck
