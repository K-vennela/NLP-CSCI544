Much like many parts of the US, the weather has been unusually cold and snowy in New York City. Just this week, we were hit with a snow storm and followed by another with sleet and rain. Students are definitely experiencing the variety of weather winter can bring to New York. In this newsletter, we welcome new parents, remind you of how we communicate to students during inclement weather, the housing reapplication process, financial aid, study away opportunities, student health, and NYU News.

FINANCIAL AID REAPPLICATION for 2014-2015
For students who are not receiving aid, but would like to be considered, the FAFSA form is required to start the process for consideration. For other students (international students) attending NYU in New York, who completed the CSS Profile last year and received NYU (non federal) financial aid, they will need to complete the CSS Profile again for scholarship consideration for 2014-2015 by the deadline of April 1. The Office of Financial Aid will also be offering a number of workshops during the coming months to assist with the reapplication process. Click here for locations, times and dates.
