Dear Aiguo,
You've done a great job in putting this together so quickly and clearly.  I 
have a couple of additional comments to make on it, but can't do so until 
Tuesday.  You (we?) might also like to think of the reply being 
multi-authored, including Phil, Pete, Kevin, Joe and myself.
I must say that when I first read this paper a couple of weeks ago I wrote it 
off as so bad (so, so bad) that it didn't even deserve a response.  To pretend 
that the Sahel drought didn't happen (i.e., a pure artifact of wrongful use of 
rainfall data) is the most astounding assertion, almost on a par with 
holocaust denial.  Try putting that proposition to the millions of inhabitants 
of the Sahel in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, many of whom died as a direct 
consequence and whose livelihoods were devastated.  Adrian Chappell may never 
have visited the region, but I know Clive Agnew has (many times) - and he 
should know better.  I did my PhD research in the region in the early 1980s 
and I know exactly what the rainfall conditions were like and how much 
oridinary people suffered as a consequence.  My PhD was on rainfall 
variability and local water supplies in Sudan and I visited and talked to many 
villagers in the region.
Anyway, Phil first suggested that a corrective reply was needed and I can see 
the value of doing so, especially with IPCC AR4 approaching.  It just seems to 
me such a shame that such poor science is being done by some people - in this 
case I don't think there is a deeper motive on the part of Chappell and Agnew 
than pure delusion and incompetence - and, worse, that a journal like IJC will 
publish it.
Thanks again for your efforts,
Mike
