Hi Phil,
lets not get into the topic of hate mail. I promise you I could fill your inbox w/ a very
long list of vitriolic attacks, diatribes, and threats I've received.
Its part of the attack of the corporate-funded attack machine, i.e. its a direct and highly
intended outcome of a highly orchestrated, heavily-funded corporate attack campaign. We saw
it over the summer w/ the health insurance industry trying to defeat Obama's health plan,
we'll see it now as the U.S. Senate moves on to focus on the cap & trade bill that passed
congress this summer. It isn't coincidental that the original McIntyre and McKitrick E&E
paper w/ press release came out the day before the U.S. senate was considering the McCain
Lieberman climate bill in '05.
we're doing the best we can to expose this. I hope our Realclimate post goes some ways to
exposing the campaign and pre-emptively deal w/ the continued onslaught we can expect over
the next month.
thanks for alerting us to that detail of Kaufman et al which I'd overlooked. We'd already
asked Darrell if he could compute a Yamal-less version of his series, but as you point out
he's really already done this!  And Osborn and Briffa '06 is also immune to this issue, as
it eliminated any combination of up to 3 of the proxies and showed the result was
essentially the same (fair to say this Tim?).
Also, is it fair to say that this particular version of Keith's Yamal series was not what
we used in Mann and Jones '03 (we reference Briffa et al '01)?
thanks for the help! We're hoping to have something up tomorrow at the latest, and any
updates at your end will be extremely helpful to the case,
mike
