I cut Hammer ref
I just thanked "ll those who provided data"
I was looking at Graybill & Shiyatov Fig 20.6, but you are right that the 
warmest period was after 1160....though some argue the MWP extends into the 
14th century....certainly it shows a cold 11th century.  So I'lll cut that 
reference, as requested...
I leave it to you to contact Dave Fisher as I don't know what he sent 
you...so get back to me asap
