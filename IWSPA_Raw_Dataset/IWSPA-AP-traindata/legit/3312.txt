Dear All,
Link below is to a paper just out in the US.  Could be some press 
coverage - as it says
there is no difference between urban and rural stations for temperature 
over the US !
Interesting to see if the skeptics pick up on this. They are probably 
still going through the
Vinnikov/Grody paper in Science showing MSU2 warming more than the 
surface, so
they have a lot to look at.
I reviewed Peterson's one with Chris and couldn't see anything wrong 
with the main message.
Cheers
Phil
