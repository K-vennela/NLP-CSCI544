Hails SS Probate Herring,
I did my part and forwarded his inquiry to NSM Colorado who is lead by Davi
the guy who got the purple heart in Afghanistan. He did not respond back. I
know the Colorado guys are active and recruiting, just processed 2 or 3 new
members from there. I cannot force them to talk to student reporters.
Apparently they just don't want to do it. I agree with you, its an
opportunity to reach people, but it seems most of our members will not talk
with any Press. 88
