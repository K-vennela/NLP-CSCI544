Dear all again,
here is the MWP figure and caption.  Note that I don't know what number it should have, because it is for a box not a standard section.  So I've just called it "mwpbox" for now.  Please can you give it the correct number and put it in the right place in the figures file?  Also, when you have numbered it, please let us know so that we can refer to it in the MWP box text.
The figure now goes right up to the present, as requested!
I've attached a word document with caption and .gif figure embedded, but also separate .gif, .pdf and .ps files for the figure.  If you don't want all these different formats, then please tell me which one(s) you want and I'll only send those in future!
Cheers
Tim
