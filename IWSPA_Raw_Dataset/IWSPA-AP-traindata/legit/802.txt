Hi Mike,
No problem. I am quite happy to work this stuff through in a careful way
and am happy to discuss it all with you. I certainly don't want the work to
be viewed as an attack on previous work such as yours. Unfortunately, this
global change stuff is so politicized by both sides of the issue that it is
difficult to do the science in a dispassionate environment. I ran into the
same problem in the acid rain/forest decline debate that raged in the
1980s. At one point, I was simultaneous accused of being a raving tree
hugger and in the pocket of the coal industry. I have always said that I
don't care what answer is found as long as it is the truth or at least
bloody close to it.
Cheers,
Ed
