HI Phil,
Thanks for your message. I'm with you 100%, and honestly am very much looking forward
to moving towards close collaboration between us. I've already talked a bit w/ Tim about
those plans and the possibility of him spending some time in Charlottesville, etc. Will
be in touch w/ you guys soon about trying to solidify some of these plans...
Yes, I will be in the Lion's den, so to speak. Not sure how much must stands behind
his roar though...We do have to deal w/ the skeptics here somewhat directly. At least,
to the extent that I do presentations on capitol hill for USGCRP (I do one w/ Jim
Hansen and Malcolm on the 17th of this month), I'm a bit in the fray. Mostly, though,
I've been trying to help Mike McCracken and company behind the scenes. We all know
what happens when a U.S. scientists becomes a thorn in the side of big business...
Anyways, I'm really happy that the air is cleared. More soon,
mike
