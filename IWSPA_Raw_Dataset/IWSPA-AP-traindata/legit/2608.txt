Dear All,
I like Phil's suggestion. I think such a piece would do a lot of good for the field. When
something as full of half-truths/mis-truths as  the S&B piece is put forth, it would be
very useful to have a peer-reviewed review like this, which we all have endorsed through
co-authorship,  to point to in response. This way, when we get the inevitable "so what do
you have to say about this" from our colleagues, we already have a self-contained, thorough
rejoinder to point to. I'm sure we won't all agree on every detail, but there is enough
commonality in our views on the big issues to make this worthwhile.
Perhaps Phil can go ahead and contact the editorial board at "Reviews of Geophysics" and
see if they're interested. If so, Phil and I (and anyone else interested) could take the
lead with this, and then we can entrain everyone else in as we proceed with a draft, etc.

p.s. Keith: I hope you're feeling well, and that your recovery proceeds quickly!
