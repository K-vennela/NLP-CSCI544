SS Probate Herring,
I understand that you are willing to  assist the main Office with answering
some genneral e-mail inquiries, is that correct? If so, we should get
started asap. Please cc or bcc me your responses to e-mails for awhile so I
can read how you are doing on them.  That is standard operating procedure
for anyone who has assisted on stafff. We may also be bringing you in on
some phone calls, and other work as we continue the march forward. Later
today I am meeting with NSM Philadelphia reps and one or 2 of the troops
from Detroit are linking up with me as well. It is as busy as ever. 88
