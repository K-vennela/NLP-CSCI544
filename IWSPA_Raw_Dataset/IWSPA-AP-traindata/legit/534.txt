Hey guys-can you please inform the Donald and HRM III that we have a DC roundtable on May 18th. Feel free to tell them that we're still working on venue but working to keep $33,400/seat policy on this one. If they have anyone they'd like to send to this (likely our last DC RT), I would be much obliged.
Invite is forthcoming.
Thanks!
