Re/ landing pages:
We=92ll link to signons at <<link>> but may send =
to fundraisers depending on how this does, which would be the same page we =
used in last night=92s rapid response, <<link>>

Re/ photo attribution:
Would it work for you if we have it on there (more visibly) like =93Attribu=
tion: <<link>> and then on that page we will h=
ave the link to the flickr page plus the language from the license page. It=
wouldn=92t be actually hyperlinked to that because of the nature of the gr=
aphic, but if someone were to type in the link into their browser it would =
take them to a page with all of the information. And if this does work, I=
=92ll share that page with you in advance of sending.
