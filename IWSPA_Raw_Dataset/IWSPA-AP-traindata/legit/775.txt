We have heard from ESRC that the ICER bid has been successful. We are to be
funded at a "reduced level", although we don't know what that is yet. Our
guess is that it will be close to the 10 million we were asked to approach
(the revised bid was about 12.5 million).
Well done everyone.
The letter asks us not to make any public announcement, publicity or press
releases until 4 April, when there will be a JIF press conference (altho we
are encouraged to prepare the press as soon as possible). Please,
therefore, continue to regard this information as confidential as far as
the outside world is concerned - I shall ask the Press Office to do the
necessary.
I will send a note out to all faculty later this afternoon.
