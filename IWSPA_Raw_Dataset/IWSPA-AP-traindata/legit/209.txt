HI Keith,
No problem, I know how hectic the past couple months have been for you, so no apologizes
necessary whatsoever!
Call me old fashioned, but I still tend to prefer the "blind" reviewer convention, so I'd
prefer to remain anonymous unless you think that revealing my identity would be help in any
particular way.
I agree w/ your take on this--a journal like GRL is probably more appropriate, or even
"Climatic Change" because a number of similar papers have been published there in the past
(by folks like Nychka, Bloomfield, and others). I'm not sure if Steve Schneider is sick and
tired of those papers though...
Please don't hesitate to let me know if I can be of any additional help w/ this.
Looking forward to seeing you one of these days,
mike
