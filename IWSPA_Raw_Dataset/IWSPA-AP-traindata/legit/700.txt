Tennessee Democratic chairman assails Republican-dominated legislative ses=
sion
Tennessee Democratic Party Chair Mary Mancini stood outside the statehouse=
Tuesday and presented a different view. "This year's legislative session=
and the 109th General Assembly perfectly illustrate the differences betwe=
en Tennessee Democrats and Republicans. Republicans are in the supermajori=
ty in the Legislature and at every critical moment when they could have sh=
own leadership they instead at best said 'There's nothing we can do' and a=
t worse showed themselves to be unethical=2C self-serving extremists=2C" M=
ancini said. "They spent hours debating the state book=2C the state rifle=
and whether or not skunks should be house pets =E2=80=94 but refused to b=
ring Insure Tennessee to the House floor for even one minute of discussion=
=2E They fought hard to give tax breaks to the top wage earners while doing=
nothing to address the fact that Tennessee has the highest percentage of=
low-wage workers in the nation."
