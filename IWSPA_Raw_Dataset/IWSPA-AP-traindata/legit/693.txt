Crew,
Very important assignment.
If you're too busy to take a few minutes to stand up
for kids to keep them psych-free, ok. If you don't
have time to help, you don't need to be reading this
either.
This is an important assignment. I'm counting on you.
1. Read this article:
<<link>>
2. Write a scathing anti-TeenScreen letter. Don't hold
back. If you need data on TeenScreen, click on
www.psychsearch.net/teenscreen.html
Don't try to pile everything in one email. Pick
something that is real to you and write a letter about
that one point.
3. Send your letter to user@domain.com.
Also, if you want, you can put your letter in the form
of a comment to the article. Just click on the article
link above, scroll to the bottom and click on "post
your feedback on this topic here".
4. Report compliance by email.
Thank you,
Doyle
