Hi Keith,
When would be a good time tomorrow (or next week) to phone you about the data you have
available at your website from your QSR 2000 paper.
I am particularly interesting in using the long chronologies from the Polar Urals (Yamal)
and Tornetrask.
This is for Gordon's and Rosanne's NH temp recon update, so I thought I should have a chat
with you before using the data.
all the best
Rob
