My view is that paleo is not important enough for the Hadley Centre for
us to spend much (or any) time helping Millennium unless there is some
cash on the table to buy some staff time. I am working 75% at the moment
so need to focus on staff management. If I do have time it will be
focused on completing the SOAP work.
