Thanks Keith,
I've made these changes and a few very minor changes just to improve the grammar in places,
etc. Also, I'm embarassed to say that Scott's name was accidentally left out of the author
list, so I've included that back in.
There was one bit about the high-pass filtering and low-pass filtering which you changed,
based on  I think some minor confusion about what I meant. I've fixed that.
I'm assuming that Tim will be ok w/ the attached, final version, so I'm going to go ahead
and submit to Nature now. We'll have ample opportunity for revision at a later stage.
Lets cross our fingers.
Thanks again everyone,
Mike
