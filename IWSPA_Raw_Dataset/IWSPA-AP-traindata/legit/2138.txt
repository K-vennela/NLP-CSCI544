Hi all - including Eystein, whom I haven't been able to talk with on 
these issues yet:
1) I'd like to get your status report on Fig. 6.12 - based on 
feedback from Henry Pollack, we will keep the borehole curves and 
corresponding instrumental data. I believe we are also going to add 
the new recon from Law Dome - Valerie was going to send. Do you have 
everything needed for this figure revision?
2) Since we met in Bergen, I have received feedback from many about 
our MWP box, and would like to float the idea that we delete the 
bottom (Osborn and Briffa) panel. I know this is shocking coming from 
me (I think O&B, 2006 is a paper of the year contender!), but I have 
become convinced that it will be too much of a lightening rod for 
what it gives us. We still show the data in the top panel, which 
conveys the same thing (although in a much less sophisticated way!), 
and we still back up with citations to O&B2006. BUT, we hopefully 
avoid a possible intense focus on methodological focus on the fig, 
and the criticism that it's LA work that hasn't been thoroughly 
vetted. This focus (i.e., from skeptics and those inclined to listen 
to them for political reasons) is stupid, but we want to keep readers 
focused on the science and not on the politically-generated flak. I 
think we can do this just as well without the O&B06 figure, assuming 
we still cite the findings of the O&B06 paper, but just don't show 
the figure. We also save space - not the reason for my suggestion, 
but a good thing given what Keith and Tim need to add in response to 
issue like divergence etc.
Obviously, was the biggest fan and pusher for the figure to be 
included, and I'm sorry to be suggesting otherwise now.
Does this make sense?
Thanks, Peck
