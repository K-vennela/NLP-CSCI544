Dear All
I think I heard replies to my last proposal from most of you. I have also
had a phone conversation with Linda. So let me try to summarize the
situation
1) From the replies I got, it sounds like at least the basic idea of my
proposal is viable. In particular I read an at least semi-consensus, and
certainly some strong individual positions, that the SRES material , since
it is unpublished (and remember unreviewed until now), should not be
presented as our sole or even primary source of conclusions. Now, I share
that position and in fact quite strongly. Presenting such material breaks
the proclaimed IPCC rules. Now the rules have been softened for this case,
but remember that there are people around who are paid to find faults in
the IPCC process and the last thing I want to do is being accused of
having broken the rules.  I think the TSU people are too optimistic and
casual in the way they change the rules during the process and expect
people to accept that this "just"  happens. Remember what happened to Ben
Santer after the SAR. Besides, I myself think that material for a document
as important as the TAR cannot be drawn from last-minute barely quality
checked and un-peered reviewed material (people have barely looked at the
MPI run that was completed last friday !!). It is up the the IPCC to
better plan these things and avoid the mess. Be it as it may, unless
somebody is strongly against this position, I will assume that we can
proceed from this basis.
2) Having said the above, it is also clear the we can present the IPCC data
in some format. Chapter 9 is doing it (remember also in their case the SRES
stuff is only a minor component of the chapter) so we can and I think we
should because it is relevant and important material, 
but with the proper caveats clearly up front, i.e. that whatever
we present is a preliminary analysis that has not undergone a publication
process. It would be certainly strange and confusing to have the SRES 
discussed in Chapter 9 but not in our chapter in some form. Besides we went
through a significant effort to get it and process it. I myself think
that the SRES information is important to provide. It is
just unfortunate, but not surprising, that it came around too late.
3) So the question is at this point how do we present the SRES. I suggested
not to incorporate it within the text of 10.3, since 10.3 is our assessment of 
published research which has undergone peer and government review. I stand
strongly by that suggestion. Obviously 10.3 might need a bit of rewriting
to make it flow better with possibly different conclusions but not more than 
that. I then suggested to make the Box an SRES Box including the +/- format
figures (I thought we needed 4, i.e. two for each scenario, but Linda pointed
out we really need only 2, one for precip and one for temperature each 
including the two scenariost). Now
this offers several advantages: we can say right up front that this is from 
a preliminary analysis; we can separate it cleanly from the rest of the 
"official " text; it gives direct info in a format that people seem to like. 
Two very legitimate comments were made on this. Peter said, if we give
this more palatable format (the +/- figures) 
only for SRES data would it not implicitly give it
too much attention? Linda said: why not present similar plots for the 
IS92 data? The obvious action which would address both of these concerns is
to present similar plots for the IS92 data. This is certainly an option.
The only problem I see is that I think the clear separation of published and 
unpublished results would be lost if we put it in the BOX. The alternative
is to do those figures and put them in 10.3, leaving the SRES for the BOX. 
This could be a good option, although it might require significant effort. 
All and all, I am still in favor of an SRES-only box with a clear statement 
up front that gets us off the hook in case of problems (you can see it
as a sort of disclaimer I guess).
So let's come to the next point: we need to decide on this and soon. The
best way appears to be a conference call. Linda suggested thursday, which
is fine with me. It now looks like Richard cannot organize this. So Linda
I am afraid you are left with the organization of it. The call 
would have to be during European-South African afternoon - US morning 
and I am afraid I am not sure what time in Australia. problems is: Jens can
you make it? I think Jens is the person in the group most strongly opposed
to presenting SRES data, so it important he is in the conference call. It
is also critical that Peter participates, given he has been the main 
player in all this. Now here is my proposal:
Conference call on thursday 3 p.m. Trieste-Hamburg time, which means 4 p.m. Cape
town time, 2 p.m. Bracknell time, 9 a.m. Boulder time, 8 a.m. Fairbanks time
and ??? Australia time. Linda is this feasible for you to organize? 
Is this ok for all? Conbin, are you available at all?
items of discussion: 
Question 1): Do we do an SRES BOX with +/- figures?
Question 2): What are the technical details (n-1 vs. n-2 model agreement,
inclusion of outliers, threshold for large vs. small vs. no
change both for precip change and temperature amplification 
factor). 
Question 3): Do we do similar figures for IS92 data which would either replace
the current figures on IS92 in the text (I think this would be 
perfectly acceptable since it is simply a way to present 
in a different way published results).
Question 4): How do we incorporate the SRES results within the current 
executive summary 
I hope that by thursday I will have all data to do all relevant figures. 
I need to get CCC control and MPI-DMI data from Bruce and dig out the old
IS92 data. If not by thursday then hopefully by friday. Once I have the 
data I can easily directly calculate all the thresholds necessary for 
doing the relevant figures. I will then circulate all the material to you.
Needless to say that any data based on SRES that is circulated among us
should NOT go any further (except for the chapter of course) until we decide 
what to do with it (a paper or something like that).
In the mean time, I will never tire to keep asking you to please work on
the section revisions and let's get those out of the way.
Cheers,  Filippo
