Myles and Curt,
Attached are the NH and SH averages from the new variance corrected
analyses (HadCRUTv). When the paper comes out in JGR (probably early next
year) you'll see that variance correction is only possible from 1870.
So in these files I've patched on the 1856-1869 data on the front so they
are the same length. This early data is the same as the original
version (HadCRUT). For the global series I still think the best way
of producing this is by averaging the two hemispheres. HadCRUT is what
you all probably have - it is on the CRU web page. Again I would
produce the globe by averaging the hemispheres so what Chris Folland has
for the globe may differ slightly as the HadC produce this as one domain.
The way the variance correction is achieved is by reducing the high-freq
variance of each grid-box series. This means that when I update the series
for 2000 some values for the last few years (1995-9) will be altered
slightly.
I don't know much about Chapter 2, but I don't recollect there being
any power spectrum diagrams. Probably left for the detection chapter.
Do make sure the axes and units are well explained. Don't leave anything
for the skeptics to cling to !
Cheers
Phil
