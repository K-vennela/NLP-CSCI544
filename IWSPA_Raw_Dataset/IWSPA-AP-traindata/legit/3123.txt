sounds good Phil, I agree on the forecast. I think its at least 
'plausible' ;)
by the way, please remind me what input you need from me at this point 
on the Wengen paper. I've attached a review paper I've got in press in 
"AREPS". Not sure if I sent this to you before. Its mostly a re-tread of 
our '04 Rev Geophys review (which is getting lots of citations if you've 
noticed!), but a little bit of newer stuff.
talk to you later,
mike
