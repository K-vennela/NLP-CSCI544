Donald Trump has won the Maryland Republican primary, according to the Associated Press.
In all recent polling, Trump held a healthy double-digit lead over John Kasich and Ted Cruz, respectively. Trump led Kasich 47 percent to 27 percent in a Monmouth University survey conducted earlier in April, while Cruz finished in third place with 19 percent.
Trump visited the state twice in the last week, rallying supporters in Berlin on Wednesday and in Hagerstown on Sunday.
Maryland allocates 24 of its 38 Republican delegates by congressional district level on a winner-take-all basis. Eleven of the remaining 14 delegates are allocated on a winner-take-all basis to the candidate receiving a plurality of the statewide vote. 
The remaining three Republican National Committee delegates are bound to supporting Trump, as the winner of the state's primary.
