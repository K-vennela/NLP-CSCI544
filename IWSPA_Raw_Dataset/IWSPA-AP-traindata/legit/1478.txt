Donald Trump has won the Rhode Island Republican primary, according to three television networks.
The frontrunner led his GOP rivals with 38 percent support in a poll conducted April 19 to 21 by Brown University's Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy. Kasich followed with 25 percent, Cruz had 14 percent and 17 percent of likely voters were undecided.
Trump held one event in the state in the week leading up to the primary, rallying supporters Monday in Warwick.
Rhode Island awards 13 of its 19 delegates proportionally on a statewide vote, of which three are Republican National Committee members from Rhode Island. For the remaining six delegates, three will be proportionally allocated from both of the state's two congressional districts.
A candidate must earn 10 percent or more in a given district in order to receive one of its three delegates. Unless Trump wins with more than 67 percent in a given district and no candidate receives less than 10 percent, all three candidates will receive one delegate per district.
