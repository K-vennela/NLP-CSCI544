Keith and Phil,
you will have seen Stephen McIntyre's request to us.  We need to talk about 
it, though my initial feeling is that we should turn it down (with 
carefully worded/explained reason) as another interrim stage and prefer to 
make our input at the peer-review stage.
In the meantime, here is an email (copied below) to Mike Mann from 
McIntyre, requesting data and programs (and making other criticisms).  I do 
wish Mike had not rushed around sending out preliminary and incorrect early 
responses - the waters are really muddied now.  He would have done better 
to have taken things slowly and worked out a final response before 
publicising this stuff.  Excel files, other files being created early or 
now deleted is really confusing things!
Anyway, because McIntyre has now asked Mann directly for his data and 
programs, his request that *we* send McIntyre's request to Mann has been 
dropped (I would have said "no" anyway).
So it's just the second bit, that we review part 2 of this response, that 
needs to be answered.
Cheers
Tim
