A Note from Mo
Dear Friends,=C2=A0
When I came back to the Hilltop last summer to build and launch GU Politics=
, I had hoped that we would build something special. Today, almost one year=
later, I'm floored by what we've been able to accomplish. I had no idea th=
at we'd pull off a major policy address by a leading presidential candidate=
, or a millennial town hall with the Speaker of the House. I had no idea we=
'd pull together two classes of Fellows that include a former Mayor, former=
Governor, former head of state, top journalists, and political operatives =
from both parties. I had no idea we'd bring four former 2016 Presidential c=
andidates to campus to share their reflections on running. I especially did=
n't know just how much the students here would impress me on a daily basis.=
They challenge us, push us, and educate us as much as we do them. All that=
in under a year. I may be biased, but I'd call that a good start. At the e=
nd of the day, I think students are fully embracing our unofficial motto: P=
ublic Service is a Good Thing. Politics Can Be Too. Thank you for joining u=
s on this journey that has been our first year. We can't wait to see what n=
ext year brings!

Advisory Board (SAB). The 12 members of the 2016-2017 SAB accomplished so =
much this year, and we wil be forever grateful to them for their enthusiasm=
, creativity, and hard work. Some of the highlights of their time together =
included:=C2=A0
- Launching GU Votes, a civic engagement initiative
- Creating and running their own programming, including the Iowa Mockus, Tr=
ivia Nights at The Tombs, and the "House of Cards" watch party
- Taking us behind the scenes of the Iowa caucuses with #HoyasInIA
While we are so sad to see them go, we are pleased to introduce the members=
of the 2016-2017 Student Advisory Board. They will be joined in the Fall b=
