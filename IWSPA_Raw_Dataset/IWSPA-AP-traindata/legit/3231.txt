Hm, clearly coordination between the two (if it really ends up as two) 
groups is absolutely essential, otherwise we would look entirely 
stupid. The first thing that comes to my mind is that nitrogen would be 
emphasizing a component of our overall idea which otherwise would not 
receive great attention - hence it could be, perhaps, amalgamated. They 
probably see it the other way around: In their problem, climatic 
variability comes second in importance. My view on this is that all of 
our model intercomparisons have shown that models essentially do crazy 
things with interannual variability, simply because nobody ever has 
tested them for that in any detail. Esser's model would probably be the 
last candidate to use here, since it is "less mechanistic" than any of 
the others - in fact, Colin and I seemed to agree to "not necessarily" 
include it into this proposal. These are just some thoughts for the 
moment.
I just finished a very first, rough draft of our outline, and I attach 
it to the end of this message. I have just sent it to Martin Heimann, 
but I have still not yet talked to him. I also send this whole thing to 
Colin, hoping that he will catch the thread through it without 
problems. Gerard Dedieu is the one I want to approach next - Alberte is 
already talking to him about this in the context with other things.
Cheers,
Wolfgang
