Hi Oyvind,
I was off work yesterday so I couldn't check the tables until today.  Keith and I have
spotted some corrections that need to be made, some my mistakes and some due to other
changes.  Sorry!  Anyway all are shown as tracked changes (plus explanation comments) in
the attached file.  Hope this is all clear and ok.
Cheers
Tim
