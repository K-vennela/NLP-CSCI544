Dr. Solomon,
It is not clear what makes the Wegman Committee Report in your opinion a
"new low". In scientific study, one part is clearly physical (growth
rates of trees, IR absorption, etc.) and a separate part is the
statistical treatment of the data.
Dr. Wegman's report is clearly focused on the latter. He is well
qualified to analyze statistical methods, as chair of the National
Academy of Sciences' (NAS) Committee on Applied and Theoretical
Statistics, and a board member of the American Statistical Association.
The conclusion of the Committee headed by Dr. Wegman is clear - the
statistical methods of MBH 98/99 cannot be relied upon to support the
claim that the 90's were the hottest decade of the past millennium. If
one wants to argue with Dr. Wegman's conclusion, it will be necessary to
show how he has misunderstood or misrepresented the statistical methods
used in those studies.
Obviously this does not prove that the 90's were not the hottest decade
of the past millennium, only that the MBH 98/99 analyses cannot be used
to support that claim, nothing more and nothing less.
Anyone interested in paleoclimatology in general, and dendrochronology
in particular, should read the recent NAS report and the Wegman
Committee Report (or in fact anyone interested in the use of statistics
in climatology).
Your last comment seems to reflect a belief that it is scurrilous to
"question unquestioned science". Wouldn't there seem to be a long
honored history of exactly this type of action, both before and after
Einstein? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting your remarks.
