Viv
attached is the text you sent with some suggestions and comments (track changes must be
on).
I am also sending a small piece of text that could be expanded if needed (this to be
inserted where you describe the treering input) - but at this stage I think you need to
have a look at comments and consider the specifics of the lake and tree sampling (the
latter if any).
I thought it best to send these comments rather that plough on doing stuff you don't want.
I think the "hook" needs to be the important opportunity to assess recent changes in lake
and tree productivity and see if any evidence for response to climate , as well as
searching for unprecedented evidence of climate change. I realise this is predominantly a
lake project with a link to trees and models , but the links must be more than token . I
can provide more background as to where we are with tree-ring work in Euro-Siberia if
needed . I think the model stuff also needs specific justification . Is Simon going to
contribute here?
Don't get hung up on the "decline or changing sensitivity issue" in trees . This is NOT a
great problem in Scandinavia, Ural/Yamal and is anyway a divergence in trend and quite
subtle and evident in wood density mostly. We are also of the opinion that it could be
partly a statistical processing artifact - we are exploring this now.
If you plough through my comments and suggestions and then return the text with specific
requests of what you wish to do I will then try to oblige thursday
cheers
Keith
