=09
While most nonprofits understand that they need to focus on efficiency and =
productivity in order to achieve their missions, not all understand how to =
do this. Furthermore, in order to achieve ultimate success or "profitabilit=
y" -- however that is measured -- nonprofits must shift the paradigm in whi=
ch they operate and begin thinking like for-profits.=A0
Most high performing organizations share a particular mindset that helps th=
em succeed, and the ultimate winners are those enterprises that are constan=
tly distinguishing themselves from the competition. Such a corporate busine=
ss model has a practical application within the nonprofit sector too. For e=
xample, this can take the form of recruiting and managing talent, gathering=
and maintaining metrics, innovating, marketing strategically, enforcing ac=
countability, competitively pursuing donors and so on. No matter what your =
organization's business objectives might be, operating within such a cultur=
e can make the difference between not reaching your mission and exceeding i=
t.
=09
Please join Lynn Ivey, nonprofit consultant, to learn more about how high p=
erforming nonprofits operate and how to develop a "for-profit" mindset for =
yours. With careful application of key approaches you can increase your imp=
act, achieve a greater scale, and continue to transform your organization a=
nd serve your community.
