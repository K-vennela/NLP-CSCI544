Ben,
Thanks for the plots. I gather from Karl that you'll be in Seattle and not at the HC
review.
I'll be in Seattle also and am missing the HC review, so we can catch up on things.
Last week was the first LA meeting of AR4. You have likely been contacted by
Kevin and also maybe by Brian Soden about writing something on tropopause heights.
It would perhaps be useful to send them these figures and maybe also to David Parker.
For our chapter Kevin is co-ordinating the U/A and circulation sections. I'm doing
the surface T/P and extremes and the final summary. I've been too busy to think about
anything
yet !  We have a mix of abilities in the LAs, but Brian, David P, Dave Easterling and
Albert
Klein Tank of KNMI are solid. The Iranian, Argentinian, Romanian, Kenyan don't seem up to
too much, but this is life in the IPCC - remember Ebby !
The fact that HadCRUT2v is close to PCM may be fortuitous, but good nonetheless. If
you
subsample PCM with CRU coverage, you say the PCM trend will reduce. The paper and report
with Adrian shows that if you look at the full ERA-40 surface T data, then the reverse
happens.
Not a large increase though. Most comes from the SH, so there are issues of what ERA-40
is doing over the Southern Oceans, Antarctica and Australia are key. I'll be talking about
this
work in Seattle.
I don't have any IDAG work to give you - not done a lot. Plan to look at the 1740 event
in Europe, when time permits. If you want any of my ppt for your IDAG talk, you can look
through in Seattle.
Good to catch up in a weeks time. Hope you and Nick are well. Away next week in Delhi
at a GCOS workshop.
Cheers
Phil
