Hi Mike and others,
I just read the AP release. As always, there is a bit of journalistic 
license that was applied to interpreting what I said. The opening 
statement in the release is utterly the  words of the reporter. Some of 
the quotes are probably accurate, but of course do not include 
qualifiers, etc. I also talked with this journo before talking with you and 
would phrase things a bit more carefully now after hearing your 
concerns. So, I am not deceiving you in what I told you over the phone. I 
would not express things the same way as you in any case, because I 
do think that we have some legitimate differences of opinion on some 
issues, although I think we agree much more than we disagree. Be 
that as it may, talking over the phone to journalists in a rapid-fire 
manner is not the best way to convey ideas and information and I 
would have re-phrased or re-expressed some of what was written if I 
had seen it before it was released. This was not an option provided to 
me.
I think that it is a bit harse to say that the paper should not have been 
published. While I might wish to change some wording in the paper 
and express things a bit differently knowing what I know now, I don't 
think that the paper is fatally flawed, like you do. I should also point out 
that I have received a number of emails from respected scientists in 
global change research who do not appear to share your opinion. On 
the other hand, I have also received a couple of emails from certified 
nuts, which is what you are obviously most concerned about. I am not 
happy with such people, but I have also been savaged by similar nuts 
like John Daly in the past. So, I guess I can't win.
Finally, this whole global change debate totally sucks because it is so 
politicized. It reminds me too much of the ugly acid rain/forest decline 
debate that I was caught in the middle of  years ago. I am quite happy 
to leave global change to others in the future.
