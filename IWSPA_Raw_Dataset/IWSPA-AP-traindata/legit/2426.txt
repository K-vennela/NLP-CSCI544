Jim,

We have no reason to do anything to you. Your letter to me about you workin=
g with the ADL ruins your credibility. I am still almost in a state of shoc=
k that you have gone so far off the deep end. Whatever issues you have, I h=
ope you get the help you need. Your Bill non-White Esque style attack on th=
e Party will be ignored by the Party, perhaps the ADL will enjoy the spin, =
but the rest of us will continue on with the mission at hand. Its a good th=
ing the NSM owned the nukeisrael site, or your friends in the ADL would hav=
e it now, as you said in your own words below. Are your ADL Lawyers going t=
o take us to court, please try it, we stole nothing. I do not intend to eng=
age your rhetoric any further, after your ADL collaboration e-mail, it is p=
lain and simple that either you have completely lost your mind, and threw a=
way all the work you have done, or well I am not even speculating any furth=
er.=20

Honor and The Oath
Open Letter to Members of the Party:=20
NSM Party Comrades,=20
Honor and The Oath Open Letter to Members of the Party: NSM Party Comrades,=
I am addressing this publically, but it is directed at active Party member=
s.=20
When I first joined the NSM I knew it would be something I would stick with=
the rest of my life. It was not a club, a gang, or some fleeting thrill fo=
r the moment: it was a commitment to a way of life, and a direct link to ma=
ny of our Forefathers who fought for Blood and Soil.=20
Fellow Party members, most of you have taken the Oath of Loyalty to the Par=
ty, and those that have not yet taken your Oath, as read in the membership =
handbook, are expected to do so as soon as possible. It is a commitment, an=
d proves you are serious about helping us to bring about changes in our Nat=
ion. It also creates Solidarity, and Kinship with your fellow Brothers and =
Sisters in our struggle.=20
In this modern day materialistic Society to some an Oath, or pledge of Loya=
lty means nothing. For those of us that live by the Old Ways, breaking an O=
ath defiles your Honor, and leaves you with nothing but an empty shell that=
once held your life force. If a man cannot stay true to his Oath, then he =
is no man but rather a castrated maggot devoid of any trace of purity or an=
Aryan Soul. Your Oath also holds you to the battlefield, until this fight =
for our Race and Nation has been won.=20
Members of the SS swear Loyalty to the F=FChrer
I often reflect about so-called Comrades that have abandoned their Oaths to=
the Party, and I wonder how they can live with themselves, as the rest of =
us face such a large scale enemy in Zog, and they give up without a fight, =
or before the fight is finished. We at Party HQ always hear a multitude of =
excuses from the Oath breakers. Sometimes their reasons are based in seriou=
s issues (still there is no reason serious enough to break your Oath) but m=
ore often than not it is trivial matters, such as personal problems with an=
other member, so and so had their feelings hurt, or this or that person was=
not thanked enough for their work, or did not get promoted, or did not lik=
e a certain rule in the chain of command, or Religion, or insert excuse her=
