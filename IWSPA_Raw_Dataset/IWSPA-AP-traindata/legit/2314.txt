Hi Peck et al.,
I've increased the axis labelling font size by another pt in all plots.
I attach two versions of 6.10, one in the grey (same as before except for bigger axis
labelling) and one in brown.  Brown looks like some old curry stain (or worse!).  Note that
conversion from postscript to PDF or GIF tends to alter the colours, which alter again on
different printers compared with the screen.  So there's not much point in me playing
around much more with the colours.
Also attached are new versions of 6.13 and 6.14.  Both have the bigger axis fonts and the
matching grey shading as 6.10.
6.13 has thicker lines for all models, so they show up better on the new darker grey
shading.
6.14 now has the EMIC forcing shown without any smoothing.  I have used a vertical scale
for the volcanoes which is half that of the solar and anthropogenic forcings.  Only one
spike (1258) hits the bottom of the plot with this choice of scaling, and only a couple
overlap the solar forcing lines.  What do you think now (Fortunat too)?  Oh, and I also
start now at 1000 rather than 900 AD.
Cheers
Tim
