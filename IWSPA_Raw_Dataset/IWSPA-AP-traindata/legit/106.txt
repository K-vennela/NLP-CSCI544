Good Afternoon
We wanted to make you aware of of a major change to Google's search 
algorithm that may cause your website to disappear from search results,
reduce your web traffic by up to 60% and significantly the number of sales inquiries you receive.
Brand XLerator is well positioned to help law enforcement OEMs to respond
to this announcement due to our deep understanding of the law enforcement
industry and our close association with Vistelar, a conflict management training
company with vast connections within your industry.
Our experts have many of years of experience helping law enforcement OEMs
increase sales by 400% to 1000% -- and you'll be hearing more from us soon.
However, this Google announcement is so important we wanted to get something out to your right away.
Our team has put together a brief video explaining the upcoming change, and
what you can do about it. Click to watch.
Make sure that your business doesn't leave prospects and, more importantly, money on the table.
Regards
Allan Haas
