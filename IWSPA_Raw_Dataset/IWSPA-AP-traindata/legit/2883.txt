1) SCHOOL'S OUT: A school once run by BERNIE SANDERS' wife is shutting its doors. POLITICO's Kimberly Hefling reports that Burlington College, which Jane Sanders ran from 2004 to 2011, will close its doors on May 27 because of financial and accrediting problems. The closure is directly related to a big-ticket purchase that Jane Sanders spearheaded during her tenure. 
The school made a big real estate purchase to replace cramped campus space, acquiring 33 acres along Lake Champlain. The hope was that the scenic Vermont property would attract new students and donors. But the play did not work and the school, with around 70 students, will now shut its doors.

2) IS BENGHAZI's POLITICAL POWER WANING?: Before he left, the top counsel for the House Select Committee on Benghazi determined nothing could have been done to prevent deaths the night of an attack on a state department facility. Exchanges between Lt. General Dana Chipman and Leon Panetta show Chipman believed Panetta had taken the right steps on the night of the attack, POLITICO's Rachael Bade reports. Not that this revelation is likely to end scrutiny. Going forward, Republicans, led by Rep. Trey Gowdy are likely to press for more information. HILLARY CLINTON, though, benefits from releases like this. Aggressive attempts by House Democrats to release information that supports her
essentially lengthen the debate: Zombifying a line of attack. It's still out there, but every leak like this diminishes its power. <<link>> 
3) LADIES FIGHT: A splash across The New York Times front page seems to have driven at least a newscycle's worth of stories about DONALD TRUMP and women. <<link>> One of the subject's of the Times' piece, Rowanne Brewer Lane, complained today that the piece cast in a negative light an experience that, she said, was not negative. <<link>> Fox News' Megyn Kelly chimed in that Trump had "no doubt" used some controversial language about women. <<link>> And Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus sort of addressed it - defending Trump but also calling for "a degree of
diversity" when Trump picks his vice presidential canidate. <<link>> 
4) MAYBE TRUMP? Much attention has been paid to Republicans who might be endangered by DONALD TRUMP at the top of the ticket. But what about Democrats in Trump Country? POLITICO's Burgess Everett and Seung Min Kim talk to red state Democrats who sound, if nothing else, Trump curious. "The people will have a chance to vote. If Donald Trump is elected president there will be a great opportunity to sit down and have a conversation about what that agenda looks like," explained Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. The North Dakota Democrat is one of several senators up for reelection in 2018 who will be wondering what impact Trump has on their political futures. <<link>> 
5) PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE: In the category of vice presidential watch: POLITICO's Edward-Isaac Dovere picks up on an interesting move from Housing and Urban Development Sec. Julian Castro. He is set to announce changes to a controversial program that sells bad mortgages on the agency's books. The issue has been a sticking point for progressive activists, who have criticized the former Houston Mayor as being insufficiently liberal. Whether this is enough to quash those concerns is an open question, but it is an interesting move from a candidate oft-mentioned as a potential running mate for HILLARY CLINTON. <<link>> 
BLAST NOTE: You may have missed this Jeff Greenfield piece for POLITICO Magazine on why, this cycle, being a VP choice isn't as great an honor as it has been. <<link>> Oh. And yes, this more than qualifies for our VP selection theme song: <<link>> 
TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, JOHN KASICH says no, DONALD TRUMP says nuh-uh. HILLARY CLINTON says Bill Clinton will be involved, but not that involved. Howard Wolfson steps up, BERNIE SANDERS takes San Juan. Homer Simpson chimes in, too.
NO KAS: JOHN KASICH rules out a third-party bid that would have been pretty hard to mount anyway. <<link>> 
BRIT BASHING: DONALD TRUMP responds to British Prime Minister David Cameron, tells him he is not dumb. <<link>> 
SO, FIRST DUDE THEN: HILLARY CLINTON says her husband won't be a Cabinet secretary. (ABC) <<link>> But, per CNN, he'll serve as a top economic advisor. <<link>> 
BLAST NOTE: A former president running, say, the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Transportation sounds like a decent spec-script for a sitcom. 
WARREN SHOT: The New York Times looks at whether Elizabeth Warren could have beaten HILLARY CLINTON. <<link>> 
WOLF HALL: Clinton 2008 aide Howard Wolfson, most recently seen as a potential architect of MICHAEL BLOOMBERG's candidacy, is hosting a fundraiser for HILLARY CLINTON. <<link>> 
'SINCERE' PRAISE: HILLARY CLINTON wins plaudits for her outreach to black women. (Huffington Post) <<link>> 
IF YOU HAVE TO LISTICLE IT ... : "13 Times HILLARY CLINTON was cooler than you thought." (US Weekly) <<link>> 
BERN BABY BERN: DONALD TRUMP keeps insisting BERNIE SANDERS should mount a third-party candidacy. (Business Insider) <<link>> 
SAN JUAN ARDIENTE: BERNIE SANDERS was in San Juan and says he'd be an ally for Puerto Rico. (CNN). <<link>> 
THE LESSON IS NEVER TRY: Last night, on a live episode of "The Simpsons" Homer Simpson "endorsed" BERNIE SANDERS and seemed to imply he'll stay in Springfield even if DONALD TRUMP is elected. Yup. (Newsweek) <<link>> 
WHAT'S NEXT: Kentucky has a primary tomorrow! And so does Oregon! HILLARY CLINTON's been ahead in Kentucky but BERNIE SANDERS has been campaigning hard there and Clinton recently spent money on ads (and is in the Bluegrass State today). Sanders is favored in Oregon.
THEY SAID IT: "I mean, I view myself as a person that - like everybody else - is fighting for survival. I, that's all I view myself as." - DONALD TRUMP in an interview with Megyn Kelly. Master of his own self perception. <<link>> 
MAGIC NUMBER: 135. That's the number of delegates on the line for Democrats in Kentucky and Oregon tomorrow. (Kentucky has 61, Oregon 74.)
