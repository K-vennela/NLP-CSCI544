Hi Amy and Jordan,
I wanted to let you know that I asked Ellen Thrower to check on hotels for potential WLF conference dates.  I tend to have trouble getting large enough hotel space since so many groups host conferences/events in the fall, so wanted her to start checking around now.
The Marriott Marquis (union) is available on September 29th & 30th and potentially available September 22nd & 23rd.  They are booked for all of October. This is where the conference was hosted in 2014 and is the largest space I've been able to use in the past. I've asked to put soft holds on those dates for now.
Happy to start moving forward whenever is appropriate!
Claire
