Hi Nanne,
Thanks for your comments. I've asked Julie Cole, who is attempting a 
revised draft, to incorporate your suggestions. Hans or you should also 
provide a revised paragraph 7 that is more to your liking than what I wrote.
I'm requesting that Julie wait until the end of this week (Friday, Jun 22) 
to give the others time to get their comments in also. Then, after Julie 
provides me w/ her revised draft, I'll try to make a few more small changes 
and sent that onto the group for suggested final changes.
I hope this sounds acceptable to all concerned?
thanks,
mike
