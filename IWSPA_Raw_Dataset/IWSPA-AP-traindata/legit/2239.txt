I haven't even received confirmation that Munger's coming yet (let alone whether or not he's bringing money).
The Potarazu family has written $332,250 to us since '13. Munger has written $100,600 (and that's only if you reach back to 2008). I don't understand why we'd be rewarding someone for giving to OFA over us.
I also don't understand why everyone seems to hate Sreedhar so much. He's hands down the most consistent donor in the Mid-Atlantic region and causes far fewer headaches than others that come to mind.
