Dear Keith and Ed,
Please, find attached the new version of the SH figure for the IPCC.  I have
now included the New Zealand record. All the records have been scaled to 4
C amplitude. Variability in the Tas record is reduced compared to New
Zealand and Patagonian records. The reference lines is the mean used for the
calibration period in each record, 15 C for New Zealand, 14.95 C for
Tasmania and 0 C for the Patagonian records (they show departures). Please,
let me know if you want to introduce some changes in the figure. The
opposite phase in the Patagonia-New Zealand records is so clear before 1850,
which is consistent with our previous TPI. For instance, in the instrumental
record the 1971 and 1976 are the coolest summer in northern Patagonian
during the past 70 years, but the warmest in New Zealand reconstruction!!
This out of phase relationship between regions in the Southern Hemisphere
points out to the difficulty of using few records to get a hemispheric
average. Cheers,
Ricardo
