Comrades,
On Friday Feb. 29th and Saturday March 1st the NSM was very busy at the
Detroit HQ and also in Ohio. On Friday a Documentary Film crew followed four
of us through Downtown Detroit as we passed out flyers advertising the March
on Washington DC. Most of the White people we could find Downtown accepted
the flyers we were passing out, of course not everyone appreciated the NSM's
anti-immigration stance, but that is just too bad for them. We soldiered on
passing out flyers until it was time to pick up another Comrade from the
Airport. After that we met up with the film crew for a detailed interview at
a meeting hall in the Suburbs. One of the film crew was curious why so many
houses in Detroit are burned up, gutted, and/or crack houses. We all know
the answer to that!
On March 1st we drove to the Lewisburg, Ohio area for an open NSM Public
Meeting, and the Burn the Hate in 2008 Book Burning. Mark Martin of NSM Ohio
conducted an interview with the film crew that was with us in
Detroit earlier in the day. When we pulled into Lewisburg we encountered
absolutely no opposition, just an NSM Flag flying high in the park
and around 50 of our Brothers and Sisters waiting to ride over to the
meeting hall.
The meeting began soon after, and featured various speakers. After the
meeting a long caravan of vehicles departed to head off to private property
for the book burning. We began the book burning by lighting a series
of torches, then the bonfire, and then set the jewish filth into the pyre's.
The degenerate books were soon cleansed by the flames, and we all watched
attentively while the ashes fell from the nights sky. NSM Radio/TV filmed
the March 1st event, as did the Documentary film crew.
Another successfull NSM event, and special thanks to all that traveled to
get to the event, and especially NSM Ohio for sponsoring another great
event. Hail Victory!
