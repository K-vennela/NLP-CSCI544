Hello,
How are you doing today? My name is Bryan Jonathan. I came across your e-mail at the Cornell University, Department of Statistical Science under Graduate Assistant directory's portal. I seek for a private tutor for my Daughter. I would like to know if you would be available for the job and I would provide you with more details my daughter.
I would also like the lessons to be at your location. Kindly let me know your policy with regard to the fees,cancellations, location and make-up lessons. Also,get back to me with your area of specialization and any necessary information you think that might help.
The lessons can start by 19th of December.
Looking forward reading from you.
My best regards,
Mr Bryan
