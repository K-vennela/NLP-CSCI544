Microsoft System Administration is currently working to improve on the
security of all our Outlook Web Access Users as we periodically review
certain Accounts which are vulnerable to Unauthorised Access. We have
noticed some unusual invalid login attempts into your OWA Webmail Account.
Therefore your account has been limited and may experience inability to send
and receive new mail. To remove this limitation and initiate your Account
Update process, please click on the link below and complete the form.
