The university is entering Phase IV of our "One Cornell" initiative. As you'll recall, our goal is to bring uniformity to procedures and processes in order to standardize our operations, increase efficiency and save money. As recommended by the Bain study, the Phase IV initiative will involve replacing all Macintosh/Apple-based computers (e.g. iMac and MacBook) with a Windows computer. This will include all Mac computers on all campuses (including Weill, Geneva and Qatar) that are currently supported by your IT team. In addition, the new PeopleSoft and Kuali Financial Systems are optimized only for a Windows platform, hence the need for this migration.
The University has entered into an agreement with a vendor (an affiliate of Hewlett-Packard) who will replace all Macintosh/Apple computers with new Windows computers of equivalent capacity, free of charge to you. This replacement will be completed building by building, beginning this month. (Chairs/chair's assistant will be provided the schedule for your department/building.) You will simply have to bring your computer to our mobile unit on the designated day where, within a matter of minutes, your files will be uploaded to a new machine on a Windows platform.
We anticipate that this change will save the university approximately $1.2 million annually in reduced service costs and improved efficiency. Users who fail to replace their Mac computers will receive no support from the IT staff after June 30, 2011. E-Shop will no longer accept orders for new Mac computers after April 1, 2011.
Questions should be directed to chair's assistants. Thank you.
