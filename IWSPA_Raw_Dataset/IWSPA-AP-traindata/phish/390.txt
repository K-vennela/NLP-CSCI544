Hello,
How are you doing today? My name is Cody Coster. I came across your
e-mail at the Cornell University, Department of Economics under Ph.D
Student's portal. I seek for a private tutor for my Daughter. I would
like to know if you would be available for the job and I would provide
you with more details my daughter.
I would also like the lessons to be at your location. Kindly let me
know your policy with regard to the fees,cancellations, location and
make-up lessons. Also,get back to me with your area of specialization
and any necessary information you think that might help.
Once you confirm your availability, I would provide you with more
helping details.Â  The lessons can start by 4th of March.
Looking forward reading from you.
My best regards,
Mr Cody.
