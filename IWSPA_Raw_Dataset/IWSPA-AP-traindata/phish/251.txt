Dear Student,
I would like to offer you an opportunity for earning extra money and making your life easier.
Get Paid To Give Your Opinion.
Believe it or not, your opinion is worth a paycheck.
With companies spending more and more of their budgets on advertising, your opinion is becoming extremely valuable.
Participating in our online survey program means that companies can gauge your immediate response to their new products or marketing initiatives.
Your opinion and feedback reveal the desires, needs, requirements, present and future expectations of the real customers to the companies. This fact tremendously helps in Research, Development and Innovation of products and services.
Companies will pay you $5 to $75 just to fill out simple online surveys from the comfort of your own home.
Get paid $50 to $150 for participating in focus group panels for 30 to 60 minutes.
Get paid to take phone surveys and you can earn as much as $120 an hour.
Participate in a focus group in your area and earn up to $400 for half a day.
Have new products sent to you before they are released on the market.
Share your opinion, and get paid, without changing your life at all.
If you are interested just reply to my email.
Best Regards,
David Sullivan
Recruitment Manager
