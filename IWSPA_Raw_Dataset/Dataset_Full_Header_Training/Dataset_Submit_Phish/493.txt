Dear valued
eBay member:

We recently have determined that different computers
have logged onto your eBay account, and multiple
password failures were present before the logons. We
now need you to re-confirm your account information to
us. If this is not completed by November 30,
2004, we will be forced to suspend your
account indefinitely, as it may have been used for
fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation
in this manner.

We appreciate your
support and understanding, as we work together to keep
eBay a safe place to trade.

Thank you for your patience in this matter.
