        and multiple passwords failures were present before the logins.
We now need you to 
        re-confirm your account information to us. If this is not completed till 
        February 09, 2005, we will be forced to suspend your account Indefinately, 
        as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes.
We thank you for your 
        cooperation in this manner .
