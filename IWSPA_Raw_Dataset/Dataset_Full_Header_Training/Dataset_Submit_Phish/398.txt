Dear ANZ customer,
During our regularly scheduled account maintenance and verification 
procedures, we have detected a slight error in your account information.
This might be due to either of the following reasons:
1. A recent change in your personal information (i.e. 
change 
of address).
2. Submitting invalid information during 
the 
initial sign up process.
3. An inability to accurately 
verify your selected option of payment due to an internal error within our 
processors.
Please update and verify your information by clicking the link below:

Thank you
