PayPal is constantly working to ensure security by regularly
  screening the accounts in our system. We recently reviewed your account, and we
  need more information to help us provide you with a secure service. Until we
  can collect this information, your access to your account features will be
  restricted. We would like to restore your access as soon as possible, and we
  apologize for the inconvenience. 

Why is my account access
  restricted?

  Your account access has been restricted for the following reason(s):

  A recent review of your account determined that we require some
  additional information from you in order to provide you with a secure
  service. 

  (Your case ID for this reason is PP-369-182-271.) 

We have reason to believe that your account was accessed by a
  third party as different computers have logged into your PayPal
  account and multiple password failures where presented before the logons. We
  now need you to re-confirm your account information to us. We understand that
  having restricted access can be an inconvenience, but protecting your account
  is our primary concern. 

  (Your case ID for this reason is PP-367-400-601.) 

How can I restore my account
  access?

      into your account and complete the secure verification form:
