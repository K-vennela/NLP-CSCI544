Dear FCU domain.com card holder,
As part of our security measures, 
                  we regularly screen activity in Federal domain.com Unions (FCU) network for anti-fraud.
We recently 
                  noticed the following issue on your account: A recent review 
                  of your account determined that we require some additional 
                  information from you in order to provide you with secure 
                  service. Case ID Number: PP-065-617-349 For your protection, 
                  we have limited access to your domain.com card until additional 
                  security measures can be completed. We apologize for any 
                  inconvenience this may cause. Please log in to your FCU account to 
                  restore your access as soon as possible.
