Place or Update domain.com Card on 
    File 

Dear 
      eBay member,

During our regularly schedule account 
      maintenance and verification we have detected a slight error in your 
      billing information on file with eBay. 
Your card 
      will be used for identification only and will not be charged at any time. 
      By having this type of identification from all users, eBay remains a safe 
      place to buy and sell. Setting up a seller account necessitates valid 
      domain.com or domain.com card and checking account information.
For 
      automatic payments, your domain.com card will normally be charged 5 to 7 days 
      after you receive your invoice. Enter and domain.com the required information. 
      Your account may be suspended for non-payment, and you may be responsible 
      for collection costs.
If you 
      don't want to place your card on file, you can enter a different email 
      instead (only certain types of emails can be used, such as those issued by 
      companies, schools, and paid domain.com Service providers).
