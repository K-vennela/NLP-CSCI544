Below you'll find the releases that the NV Democratic Party put out on this. Flagging that the NV Chair has been receiving<<<link>>> death threats after her cellphone number was posted on social media, and that Bernie supporters defaced<<<link>>> the NV Dems' office yesterday. Suffice it to say that the NV Dems are not happy at all, and are pushing back hard. Their main argument is that the process was not rigged. Also, would flag that the day before the Convention started, both Reid and Sanders put out a statement calling for a "respectful and constructive" Convention.

For the Alaska Democratic Convention, would be great to refer them to this line from the RNC's own research:

Dozens Of Angry Sanders Supporters Walked Out Of The Alaska Democrat Convention During OrganizationChair Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Keynote Speech."The anger over Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was highlighted when more than 25 Sanders supporters walked out of her keynote speech Saturday night at the Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center in Anchorage, though they left in a trickle while a huge crowd remained to hear the Florida congresswoman and Organizationchair call for unity among Democrats to stop the presumptive GOP nominee, Donald Trump." (Alex DeMarban, "At Tense Alaska Democratic Convention, Allegations Of Clinton Favoritism Fly," Alaska Dispatch News<<<link>>>, 5/15/16)
Also, let's refer them to User' tweet highlighting that the Chair received a standing ovation at the end of her speech: <<link>>

NV Dems Statement on State Convention Conclusion
Las Vegas, NV - The Nevada State Democratic Party released the following statement on the conclusion of yesterday's 2015 State Convention:
"At approximately 10:00 p.m. on Saturday night, the Director of Security for the Paris Las Vegas Hotel informed the State Party and representatives from both presidential campaigns that the property could no longer provide the necessary security under conditions made unruly and unpredictable. Paris Las Vegas Hotel security requested a prompt conclusion to the event. Therefore, recognizing the business still to be conducted by the convention, the State Party Chairwoman accepted a motion to agree to the Party Leader and Elected Official (PLEO) and At-Large Delegate slates as submitted by the presidential campaigns. She also accepted a motion to adopt and elect the State Central Committee pursuant to the rules and as submitted by the county party chairs. This allowed the State Party to properly adjourn the State Convention."

Subject: MEMO: NV Dems State Convention - Final Credentials Report
Date: Saturday, May 14, 2015 
Following the reading of the final credentials report today at the State Convention, a rogue member of the Credentials Committee decided to create chaos and disruption by providing misleading information about ineligible Sanders Delegates and Alternates.
There were 64 Sanders Delegates and Alternates whose validity was challenged because of the following issues:

  *   They were not registered Democratic voters in Nevada by May 1, 2016.
  *   Their information - such as address, date of birth and name - could not be found or identified, and they did not respond to requests from the party and campaigns to correct it.
Of these 64 Delegate and Alternates, six were allowed to be seated after their appropriate information was provided and 58 were denied because of the reasons outlined above.
Any insinuation of unfairness is totally inaccurate. The Nevada State Democratic Party abided by the unanimous rules set forth by the Credentials Committee, which was comprised of party leaders and officials with an equal division of both Clinton and Sanders campaign supporters.
