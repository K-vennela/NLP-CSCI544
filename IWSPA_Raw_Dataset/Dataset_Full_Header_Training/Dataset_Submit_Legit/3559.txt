I will take it all to heart.   I will get my head around it. 




What would help me a lot,  is the favor to push the bob z/Graham to us.  I have really worked hard on the bob relationship, he really likes me, you will need some exec to manage it for you, and we might not have much say, but I will have more than otherwise.  And it will be deal driven anyway and im good at that..
