Jane Sanders: Bernie will provide tax returns when Clinton releases transcripts<<<link>>>

Jane Sanders said Tuesday that her husband will make his tax returns public when Hillary Clinton releases transcripts of her paid speeches for Wall Street.

CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Sanders about when she might release her husband's old tax returns, as the senator from Vermont has said his wife prepares them each year.

"He's counting on you to release them. You did release the 2015 tax returns. What about earlier years? How's that looking?" Blitzer said.

"You know, what's interesting is we released the 2014," Sanders said. "Hillary Clinton hasn't released a transcript yet."

She then confirmed that she'll provide the returns when Clinton publishes her Wall Street transcripts, before trying to turn the interview away from the topic.

"Honestly, Wolf, these are not the issues that are of concern to the American people," she said. "I implore you as a leading, wonderful host of a major show, please talk about the issues that concern the American people instead of delegate math and who can win or who can lose."

Earlier in the show, Sanders said: "Everybody just keeps on talking about delegate math, delegate math. And I'm more of a fan of history and social studies and literature."

Heading into primaries across the Northeast on Tuesday, she said she and her husband's campaign "expect to do best" in Rhode Island, which is the only state with an open primary Tuesday. But she also said Pennsylvania and Connecticut "look good."

And, regardless of the results, Sanders said her husband won't throw his support behind Clinton until he officially loses the nomination.

"We have always said we will support the democratic nominee. But not in April. In July," Sanders said.
