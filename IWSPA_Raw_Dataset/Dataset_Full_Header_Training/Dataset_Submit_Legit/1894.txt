Aaron can you reach out and see if ADL would be on board with doing something like this? You can show them the draft if yu want.

I think this is good-- especially the last paragraph.

2 things:

1. The sentence:"According to Politico, Jewish leaders on both sides of the aisle were dismayed by Trump's refusal to combat"
Is there suppose to be something at the end of that sentence? Maybe anti-semitism?

2. Want to call everyone attention to the article below because:
A. Some of these groups may be hesitant to issue this statement with us for the reasons articulated (but I think we should try)
B. JCPA is also not on our list and I think we may need to reach out
