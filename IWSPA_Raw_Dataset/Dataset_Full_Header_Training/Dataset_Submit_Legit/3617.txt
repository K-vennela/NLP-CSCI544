*Republicans Continue to Reject A Potential Trump Presidency as Risky,
Divisive & Unpredictable: Wednesday Edition*

Day after day, Republicans are continuing to reject Donald Trump's
unpredictable, risky and divisive candidacy. Trump has for years proven
himself to be a loose cannon whose hateful language and dangerous policies
will do serious harm to working families and put America=E2=80=99s security=
 at
risk, and Republicans are continuing to acknowledge that a President Trump
would be too big a risk.

*Read the growing list
<<<link>>
ebuke-trump-as-he-captures-republican-nomination/>
of Republicans and conservatives unwilling to support a President Donald
Trump and fresh condemnations of Trump:*

*Eliot Cohen, Counselor to U.S. Department of State under President George
W. Bush
<<<link>>
ml>:*
"Mr. Trump=E2=80=99s temperament, his proclivity for insult and domain.com and =
his
advocacy of unpredictability would make him a presidential disaster =E2=80=
=94
especially in the conduct of foreign policy, where clarity and consistency
matter."

*Jeb Bush:
<<<link>>>=E2=80=
=8B =E2=80=8B*=E2=80=9CFirst,
not all Hispanics are Mexican=E2=80=A6 Secondly, not all Hispanics eat taco=
s.
Thirdly, showing your sensitivity by eating an American dish is the most
insensitive thing you can do. Fourthly, to say this, next to all things he
already said, is a further insult. It=E2=80=99s like eating a watermelon an=
d saying
=E2=80=98I love African-Americans.=E2=80=99=E2=80=A6 If we lose in November=
, we Republicans have
ourselves to blame.=E2=80=9D

*Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen [R-FL]:
<<<link>>>* On
supporting Donald Trump: "No, I'm not. And who would have ever thought when
I did that interview that talking about having a transgender son would be
more comfortable than saying I'm not going to support my Republican party
nominee?"

*Rep. Reid Ribble [R-WI]:
<<<link>>>* "Ribble...remains
deeply opposed to Donald Trump while his party begins to rally around him.
=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s an unrecoverable relationship, let me put it that way=
,=E2=80=9D Ribble says
of his attitude toward the New York developer, a candidate he says lacks
the temperament to be president."

*Ken Cobb, Chair Beltrami County, Minnesota Republicans:
<<<link>>
rump-some-state-republicans-want-party-emphasize-local>
*"Speaking on my behalf ... I am concerned about our presumptive nominee,
that he is at odds with the principles that make our party what it is,"
Cobb said. "I'm concerned that he will do considerable damage just by
association to our candidates who are conservatives."

*John Weaver, former Chief Strategist for John Kasich:*

=E2=80=9CI think a combination of his rhetoric, his inability to bring peop=
le
together, which is what you have to do in swing stages like Michigan, ...
are going to put Michigan out of reach for him."

*Minnesota State GOP Convention Delegate Walter Hudson:

=E2=80=9CWe want to send a clear message that Republicans in Minnesota
categorically reject the divisive candidacy of Donald Trump.=E2=80=9D
