Think there's any kind of diddy you=FD guys could do off of this a la "GOP =
senators in denial about Trump...But don't do their jobs to hold SCOTUS sea=
t open for him"?

GOP senators in denial about Trump

Republican lawmakers refuse to acknowledge the business baron as their stan=
dard bearer even as he closes in on the nomination.

By BURGESS EVERETT 04/28/16 05:44 AM EDT

Donald Trump declared himself the presumptive Republican nominee after his =
romp across the Northeast Tuesday night.

Republican senators trying to save their majority this fall apparently didn=
=92t get the message.

Fully aware that the GOP nominee could make all the difference in whether t=
hey keep or lose their slim, 54-seat Senate majority this fall, Republicans=
 of all ideological stripes clearly aren=92t ready to accept the bombastic =
TV reality star as their standard-bearer. A dozen GOP senators interviewed =
on Wednesday acknowledged only that Trump is doing well =97 quite the under=
statement after his clean sweep and mathematical elimination of Ted Cruz fr=
om winning the nomination without the help of a contested convention.

Some said they=92ll domain.com until the July convention to weigh in on Trump, le=
t alone decide on an endorsement.

=93He=92s very close to wrapping it up. =85 I think it is likely that he is=
 going to be the nominee,=94 said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. =93I=92ve al=
ways supported the Republican nominee, and I don=92t think this year will b=
e different. But I=92m going to domain.com and see what happens at the convention=
.=94

Blocking out the business mogul is, of course, a lot easier said than done.=
 Vulnerable senators will have to run parallel campaigns that try to levera=
ge Trump=92s positives =97 his popularity with crossover voters drawn to hi=
s devil-may-care campaign style =96 without being dragged down by some seri=
ous negatives. For starters, how to distance themselves from Trump=92s rhet=
oric on women and Latinos, and the controversies he=92s stirred on issues r=
anging from immigration to abortion.

It=92s a headache that has plenty of Republicans who are not up for reelect=
ion this fall breathing a sigh of relief.

=93I=92m just glad I=92m not on the ballot,=94 said Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev=
.), who outperformed Mitt Romney in his swing state in 2012.

Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado on Wednesday became the third GOP senator to =
endorse Cruz, who just a few weeks ago was seen as the party=92s best bet o=
f blocking Trump from the nomination. But otherwise, the movement to stop T=
rump has slowed to a crawl on Capitol Hill. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) touted =
his vote for Cruz in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, only to watch his pick lose t=
o Trump by 35 points in the Keystone State a few hours later.

=93Republicans will vote for a Republican and that will be somebody other t=
han Donald Trump,=94 Gardner insisted on Wednesday.

Any shift among Republican senators in welcoming Trump as the likely head o=
f their party are subtle at best. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Cor=
ker (R-Tenn.) praised Trump=92s =93very good foreign policy speech=94 on We=
dnesday, and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) is bullish that Trump would run a di=
fferent campaign for the general election than he has in the primary race.

=93He=92s going to have revamp things he=92s doing, and I think he=92ll be =
able to,=94 Hatch said in an interview. =93He hasn=92t won it yet, but if h=
e does, I=92m going to support him.=94

Many Republicans still want to stop Trump but acknowledge they are powerles=
s to do so. After all, these are the folks who backed Jeb Bush or Marco Rub=
io.

Endorsements barely move the needle, and Cruz is running out of opportuniti=
es to stop the New Yorker. His pact with John Kasich to block Trump=92s pat=
h sputtered out of the gate, and Republicans aren=92t exactly convinced tha=
t Cruz=92s choice of Carly Fiorina as his running mate will transform the r=
ace.

=93That alliance with Kasich sure did wonders,=94 Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.)=
 said sarcastically. He views the increasingly likely nomination of Trump w=
ith =93fear and dread.=94

The head of the Senate GOP campaign arm wouldn=92t even touch Trump.

=93In a year-and-a-half, I=92ve not answered any questions about the presid=
ential race. Trying to think of why I should start today,=94 said National =
Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi when a=
sked whether Trump is the presumptive nominee. =93I=92m going to decline.=
=94

Democrats have made it clear they=92ll spend every day until the election h=
anging Trump around the neck of every vulnerable Republican incumbent if he=
=92s the nominee. In response, Republicans are doing all they can to stake =
out their independence.

Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) has been on the floor all month whacking the Hous=
e for not taking up his opioid prevention bill. And back home, he=92s touti=
ng his ability to forge consensus with Democrats.

His argument is that voters still care about accomplishments in a purple st=
ate like his own, not abrasive rhetoric that heaps blame on both parties.

=93I=92m not Donald Trump. And nobody perceives me as Donald Trump,=94 Port=
man said Wednesday. =93You won=92t hear me giving a lot of red meat speeche=
s. I never have. That=92s not my thing. You will hear me talking about how =
we work together to solve problems.=94

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) plans to distinguish himself by leaning on his n=
ational reputation as a two-time presidential hopeful himself. His opponent=
, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.), is working diligently to tie the 2015 GOP=
 nominee with the favorite for the 2015 nomination.

=93My name ID is 100 percent. They know me, so they=92ll be making their ju=
dgment on me rather than anybody else,=94 McCain said of Arizona voters.

Not everyone is eager to show their hand about how they intend run alongsid=
e, or against, Trump. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who quipped about a campai=
gn of =93The Ronald and the Donald=94 last month, declined to discuss the m=
atter on Wednesday. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) similarly rebuffed questions abo=
ut how he=92d run with Trump at the top of the ticket and said he had =93st=
opped analyzing=94 the unpredictable presidential race.

Even senators who are shoo-ins for reelection want to domain.com until the die is=
 cast before speaking of Trump as the presumptive nominee.

=93People are still deciding that,=94 said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) =
=93I=92ve really not gotten into the race. Obviously, I=92ve got one vote l=
ike everyone else does in my state. I voted in our primary.=94

So who=92d he vote for?

=93Nice try,=94 Lankford responded.
