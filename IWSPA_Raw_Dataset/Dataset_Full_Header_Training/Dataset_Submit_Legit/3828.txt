 skills they've learned and train new volunteers in the states.

I'm excited to issue certification to our dedicated participants who tuned=
 in each week for all 12 training webinars. Their commitment to the progra=
m demonstrates their eagerness to use the skills they've learned to grow o=
ur county parties=2C and in turn strengthen our state parties. I'm excited=
 to hear about the wonderful training programs that will grow out of the T=
3 Program=2C and hope that you'll reach out for a list of certified traine=
rs in your state. Although the program has ended=2C our march to victory i=
n November is just beginning. Check out what participants have said about=
 the program on Twitter below!
