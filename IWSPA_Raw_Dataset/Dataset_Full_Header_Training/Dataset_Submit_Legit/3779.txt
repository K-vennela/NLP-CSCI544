We have to change the tone. our direction and framing on Trump and his fore=

we are to talk about his foreign policy speech below. That means music shou=

As he=92s done throughout his campaign, Dangerous Donald Trump is proving t=

His maiden policy speech on Wednesday, devoted to foreign affairs, earns an=

The 5,000-word speech lacked specifics by normal political standards, if no=

is that the businessman has the brains and strength to solve a given proble=
m, and everybody else is a pathetic loser, so trust his instincts and tempe=

=85

For prepared remarks, or for that matter even an after-dinner talk, Mr. Tru=

 =93disciplined, deliberate and consistent.=94

Mr. Trump isn=92t known for close readings of his briefing books, if such d=

Mr. Trump repeatedly states outright falsehoods, often based on wrong assum=

aking =93millions of dollars a week=94 by selling Libyan oil. There is zero=
 evidence of that. The nuclear deal with the United States and other major =
powers has not made Iran a =93great power,=94 nor has Tehran violated the c=

Mr. Trump says he knows how to negotiate, and to him that seems to mean put=

Trump's unreal foreign policy: Our view
<<<link>>
cy-isil-china-editorials-debates/83608222/>USA TODAY // EDITORIAL BOARD
As anyone who watches reality television knows, the genre might be entertai=
ning, but its correlation to actual reality is tenuous.

Which is a good place to start with the  much-awaited foreign policy speech=
 delivered Wednesday in Washington by presidential candidate Donald Trump.

As with The Apprentice, the show that helped him become a household name, t=
he Republican front-runner sought to provide appealing fare for a certain c=
lass of people. In this case, the primary audience was voters opposed to tr=
ade, resentful of immigrants, distrustful of foreign governments, and wistf=
ul for a time when America wielded more power in a simpler world.

In reaching out to this group, Trump vividly portrayed a world that does no=
t exist: America=92s allies would be more respectful after being lectured t=
o, while its enemies would be dealt with by bluster. China would fall into =
line after enduring unspecified economic pressure. And troubled regions of =
the world would be stabilized through U.S. disengagement.
=85

Things might happen that way on TV. But not in reality. Or perhaps we shoul=
d say real reality.

THE SACRAMENTO BEE // THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Then, he gave a rambling, vague and incoherent speech Wednesday full of pla=

fortable. Our longtime allies certainly won=92t be confident.

WASHINGTON POST // ANNE APPLEBAUM
If you weren=92t already convinced that parody is now the central art form =
of our era, then Donald Trump=92s grand foreign policy speech yesterday was=
 the proof.
=85

The multiple inconsistencies and internal contradictions have already been =
listed by others. On the one hand, he said that =93your friends need to kno=
w that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them.=94 On the =
other hand, he threatened to =93walk=94 if those same friends didn=92t pony=
 up to his demands. He wants to invest heavily in the military, but he want=
s to stop using the military. He doesn=92t want to do =93nation-building=94=
 but does want to promote =93regional stability.=94 There was no sense that=
 he knew what either of those terms actually meant.
=85

Anyone who sits down and analyzes the speech from start to finish will, of =
course, worry about the contradictions, the inconsistencies, the impossible=
 claims, the detachment from reality.

Those expecting a coherent, well-ordered view of the world and a strategy t=

ASSOCIATED PRESS// LOLITA C. BALDOR AND SAGAR MEGHANI
Donald Trump strained to lay out a clear vision of his "America first" fore=

he called a post-Cold War era replete with U.S. national security failures.

Yet the Republican presidential front-runner outlined no strategy for how h=

and international critics =97 Republicans at home as well as Democrats =97 =
who see him as domain.com for the responsibilities of commander in chief.
=85

Trump also contradicted his own broad-brush approach to foreign policy. He =
said at one point that the best way to achieve his goals was through "disci=
plined, deliberate and consistent" policy. Later, however, he exhorted the =
nation to "be more unpredictable" in how it combats enemies.
