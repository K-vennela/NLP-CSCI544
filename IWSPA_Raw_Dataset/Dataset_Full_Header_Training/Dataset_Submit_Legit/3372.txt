		=09
The Department of Labor has now issued its long awaited proposed revised ov=
ertime regulations to the Fair Labor Standards Act. The last major revision=
s to the FLSA were in 2015 and employers have been operating under these st=
andards since then. The proposed revisions reflect a significant change in =
how employers can determine which employees are exempt and which employees =
will now be entitled to overtime. One thing that won't change, however: whe=
n implemented, failure to be in compliance with the new requirements can re=
sult in significant liability for an employer.=A0
		=09
We'll cover:
		=09
In-depth overview of the proposed overtime revisions and what they mean for=
 employers.
The significance of the new proposed revised regulations with regard to how=

Changes with regard to the salary level test for determining who is an exem=
pt employee that will now make many more employees eligible for overtime.
And more!

Please join Melissa Fleischer, attorney at law, as she provides in-depth an=
alysis of the proposed new FLSA overtime regulation revisions and how emplo=
yers should implement these to help protect them from liability for misclas=
sification of employees. In addition Ms. Fleischer will discuss the amount =
of overtime employers may be required to pay under the new overtime rules t=
o employees who were previously not entitled to overtime since they were pr=
eviously classified as exempt.
