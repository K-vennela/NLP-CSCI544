Subject: RE: R: Re: R: Invoices Balance Hi Mesfer,  I thought that in my previous mails was clear that HT gave TCC green light to pay legal fees for SAR 10.000, equivalent around to 2.300, if it means that we can receive back the remaining balance of eur 34.350, net deduction of legal fees.  If my assumptions made above are correct, you can go ahead. Look forward to your reply.Kind regards,  Simonetta Gallucci

Subject: RE: R: Re: R: Invoices Balance Hi Mesfer,  in this case I think that the only practicable solution is that TCC pay straight the amount net deduction. We apply today currency change of 4.3547 from Bank of Italy (<<link>>), so we consider a deduction of eur 2.296,37; it means that remaining amount TCC should pay is eur 32.053,63.  Do you agree?Thanks again,  Simonetta Gallucci

Subject: Re: R: Invoices Balance Dear Mesfer,  I think that the best practice to manage this matter is to proceed as follows: - you send us a wire transfer for the total amount of eur 34.350- your legal advisors send us an invoice, issued to HT (you should have all details) for the amount agreed (SAR 10.000)- once we receive your payment we will go ahead with the wire transfer for your legal advisors Does it work for you?Thanks again for your support. Kind regards,  Simonetta GallucciFinancial Controller

Oggetto: Invoices Balance Dear Mesfer,  as anticipated by our Account Manager Emad I write to request you an update about our invoices balance.  Here below a short recap of the situation:  Invoice No. AmountCollected amountBalance157/2012€ 370.500,00€ 351.975,00€ 18.525,00045/2013€ 28.500,00€ 18.525,00€ 9.975,00048/2013€ 39.000,00€ 33.150,00€ 5.850,00 From an accounting point of view, the income of eur 18.525,00 received on Jan. 21st 2015 should be allocated to balance our invoice No. 157/2012, instead of considering it as an advanced payment for the invoice No. 045/2013.  It means that for us the invoice No. 045/2013 is totally due and it remains also a balance to receive for the invoice No. 048/2013 (eur. 5.850); expected total amount is eur 34.350. If it was applied a withhold tax, we need to receive as soon as possible the related certificate; otherwise we consider the pending balance abovementioned.  I kindly request you to give me a feedback about this matter by next Wednesday, in order to solve it.Best regards,  Simonetta Gallucci
