Talking Points =96 With NDAA, House GOP Leads American Families Down =93Ano=
ther Road to Nowhere=94

Republicans=92 Defense Authorization: =93Another Road to Nowhere=94
Democrats firmly believe in a strong national defense.  In a time of growin=
g threats and turmoil abroad, we know we must have a defense budget that me=
ets the challenges of our time, provides long-term certainty to our militar=
y, and strengthens the security of American families.

But instead of giving our military and our budget certainty, Republicans ar=
e once again asking Congress to vote for a blatant, dangerous and irrespons=
ible budget gimmick.

=B7         This year, the Republicans taking $18 billion from the Overseas=
 Contingency Operations (OCO) account means that funding for our combat tro=
ops will end on April 30, 2015 =96 a dangerous step.

=B7         Furthermore, the Republicans are taking this $18 billion and us=
ing it for items not requested by the Administration.

Just as when House Republicans tried and failed to do a somewhat similar bu=
dget gimmick last year, Defense Secretary Ash Carter has made clear that th=
is Republican budget gimmick is a =93road to nowhere=94 and drastically und=
ermines national security.  As Secretary Carter testified<<<link>>
e.gov/News-Article-View/Article/744202/carter-dods-fy17-budget-request-take=
s-long-view> on April 27:

Republicans=92 approach is =93another road to nowhere,=94 =93deeply troubli=
ng and flawed for several reasons.  It=92s gambling with warfighting money =
at a time of war =96 proposing to cut off our troops=92 funding in places l=
ike Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria in the middle of the year.=94

That=92s why the Administration has issued a veto threat<<<link>>
domain.com/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/114/saphr4909r_20160516.pd=
f> against the bill:

=93H.R. 4909 fails to provide our troops the resources they need to keep ou=
r Nation safe=85 By gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the saf=
ety of our men and women fighting to keep America safe, undercuts stable pl=
anning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their fa=
milies, baffles our allies, and emboldens our enemies.=94

The Republican gimmick before the House is both bad budgeting and harmful t=
o military planning; perpetuating uncertainty and instability in the defens=
e budget and damaging the military=92s ability to plan and prepare for the =
future.  It=92s dishonest and dangerous.

Republicans are breaking the Bipartisan Budget Act less than six months aft=
er it was signed into law.  Instead of resorting to blatant and reckless bu=
dgetary stunts, House Republicans should join with Democrats to fully suppo=
rt our men and women in uniform and protect our national security.

Do Your Job, House Republicans
For months, House Republicans have blocked action on President Obama=92s ur=
gent request for an emergency supplemental to confront the rapid spread of =
the Zika virus.

Now, with more than 1,200 Americans =96 including more than 110 pregnant wo=
men =96 already with confirmed cases of Zika, House Republicans are telling=
 American communities desperate for help to make do with less than a third =
of what America=92s top public health officials say is needed to protect Am=
erica=92s families.  As Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institu=
te of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health,=
 said<<<link>>
uci-stalled-funding-raises-zika-threat/84234424/>:

=93If we don't get the money that the president has asked for, the $1.9 bil=
lion, that is going to have a very serious negative impact on our ability t=
o get the job done.=94

The growing threat of Zika demands passage of the President=92s full $1.9 b=
illion supplemental now, not a woefully inadequate proposal tied to an appr=
opriations bill that is six months away from the President=92s desk.

Democrats are sending a clear message to the Republican Congress: do your j=
ob to keep the American people safe, and don=92t shortchange the resources =
needed to confront this very serious threat.

Every day, we learn more and more about the danger Zika represents to expec=
tant mothers.  But House Republicans=92 response is to obstruct the strong,=
 smart action Americans need, and to make American communities domain.com months =
for an entirely inadequate Republican response:

=B7         The House GOP has voted twice to block emergency resources to p=
rotect American communities from Zika;

=B7         Now, Republicans are pushing a bill with a funding level less t=
han one-third of the amount of the President=92s emergency request that fur=
ther depletes the ability of the U.S. to respond to the ongoing global thre=
at of Ebola.

Republicans=92 radical and dangerous refusal to address the threat of Zika =
in a serious way could have tragic consequences for families across America=
.

Again and again, Republicans have given lip-service to helping families and=
 communities in crisis =96 but they have relentlessly obstructed real actio=
n and the resources needed to make a difference:

=B7         Zika =96 Republicans voted twice to block meaningful emergency =
funding to address Zika;

=B7         Opioids =96 Republicans voted twice last week to block the $600=
 million in fully paid-for vital new resources to address the opioid epidem=
ic that kills 78 Americans every day.

=B7         Flint =96 Republicans are blocking any action to help the thous=
ands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water.

Furthermore, instead of coming together with Democrats to pass a budget res=
olution that will create jobs and grow the paychecks of hard-working Americ=
an families, Republicans have decided not to pass a budget at all.

Today, Republicans moved to begin bringing appropriations bills to the floo=
r without having enacted a budget, the final admission that Speaker Ryan ha=
s given up on trying to pass the Ryan Road-to-Ruin Budget proposal.  Here=
=92s what was too weak to satisfy the radical forces that have seized contr=
ol of the Republican Party; a budget that would:

=B7         End the Medicare guarantee for seniors;

=B7         Make $6.5 trillion in cuts =96 the sharpest cuts ever proposed =
by the House Budget Committee;

=B7         Devastate investments in good-paying jobs, education, and Ameri=
can infrastructure;

=B7         Repeal the Affordable Care Act and dismantle the affordable hea=
lth care of 20 million Americans.

Hard-working families deserve a Congress that protects their safety and inv=
ests in their future.  Democrats will continue to press for action to keep =
American communities safe, and we will continue to make a simple appeal to =
House Republicans: do your job.
