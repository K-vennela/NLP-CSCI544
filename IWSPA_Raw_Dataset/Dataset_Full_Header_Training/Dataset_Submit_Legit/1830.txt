Time to re-examine Nevada=92s caucus system<<<link>>
inion/time-re-examine-nevada-s-caucus-system>

By Roberta Lange
Special to the Review-Journal

On Feb. 20, voters made their voices heard in the Democratic presidential r=
ace at precinct caucuses across Nevada, many of them for the first time. Th=
e contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders was energetic and hard=
-fought, a clear reminder of why the country needs an early state with Neva=
da=92s demographic, regional and cultural diversity.
But despite the substantial innovations the Nevada State Democratic Party i=
ncorporated this year, the caucus process remains difficult for too many pe=
ople. The neighborhood meeting format may have made sense in an earlier tim=
e, but it simply doesn=92t make as much sense today.
We sought out input over the past two months, and we=92re listening. Long l=
ines and technological mishaps are not acceptable, and they turn voters off=
 from taking part in an important civic duty.
But before we look at how we can improve things in future elections, let=92=
s remember how we got here in the first place.
Nevada has actually been a presidential caucus state by statute since 1981.=
 When Nevada and South Carolina were formally moved up on the presidential =
calendar for the 2015 election cycle, the Organization wan=
ted the balance of adding one primary state and one caucus state to join Io=
wa and New Hampshire before Super Tuesday. We were able to become an early =
state because the Nevada Legislature had defined us in state law as a caucu=
s state.
The reality is that Nevada has been a caucus state for decades, and the onl=
y change in 2015 was our early-state status =97 and the increased attention=
 from voters, candidates and the media that came with it.
In the 2015 legislative session, Nevada Republicans led a poorly timed effo=
rt to shift our state to a presidential primary system and change the rules=
 in the middle of the game. The push demonstrated a total lack of understan=
ding of the politics surrounding the presidential primary calendar.
This plan, introduced less than a year before the presidential nominating p=
rocess began, created serious uncertainty and would have put Nevada at risk=
 of losing its early slot on the calendar. Local county registrars were voc=
al in expressing their logistical concerns. Democratic legislators were rig=
ht to prevent this plan from becoming law.
Opposing the Republicans=92 misguided proposal was never about preserving t=
he caucuses for the sake of the caucuses. It was about preserving Nevada=92=
s vital role as one of the four early states.
With the caucuses in the rear-view mirror, now is the right time for Nevada=
ns to re-examine our existing caucus system and foster a thoughtful discuss=
ion about how we move forward to make this process more convenient and acce=
ssible.
Whether it=92s shifting to a state-funded primary or substantially revampin=
g the mechanics of the party-run caucuses, we will need to work with the Ne=
vada legislature and the Organizationto protect our priorities as Democrats: to inc=
rease voter access and retain our important position in this process.
A presidential primary, managed and paid for by the state, could divert lim=
ited resources away from critical and underfunded services such as educatio=
n and mental health. It would also repeal the same-day voter registration c=
urrently enjoyed by Democratic caucus-goers in Nevada. If Republicans are s=
incere about increasing voter participation, their calls for changing the c=
aucus system must include adopting same-day voter registration.
Nevada=92s caucuses empowered our diverse population to be heard in 2016, h=
elping ensure that Western values are represented in the Democratic Party a=
nd our national political discourse. We need to make certain that happens a=
gain in 2015 =97 in a way that=92s easier and opens the door for more Nevad=
a voters. We look forward to continuing this conversation and hearing your =
ideas in the months ahead.
Roberta Lange is chair of the Nevada State Democratic Party.
