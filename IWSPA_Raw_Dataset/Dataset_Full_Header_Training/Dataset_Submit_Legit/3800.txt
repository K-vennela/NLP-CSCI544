Have any of you heard of this? They want to pitch us, but I wasn't sure who the right person is to connect them with. Is this something any of you would be interested in? If not, I'll decline.

Anu - I am reaching out because one of my clients has a new turnkey solution for online video chat events that offers the dynamics of an in-person event at domain.com scale.

I think it could really domain.com the DNC, its organization, down and up ballot races, fundraising efforts, persuasion campaigns, constituents relations and more.

In fact, via my sister April Mellody, the Deputy CEO for Communications at 2015 Democratic National Convention, we are talking with Kelli Klein, the digital director about the technology tomorrow and how this may work at the convention.

That said, I wondering who may be best at the Organizationto try and get meeting with to do a demo the platform, which is called Shindig [info below].

I would really appreciate any guidance you may have. I look forward to repaying the favor.

Shindig Overview <<link>> and below some of the use cases we thought of:

Convention/Campaign Appearances: candidates, speakers and surrogates can maximize time, and reach geographically distributed organizations, interest groups, and other entities with high-touch and tremendous efficiency. These are tele-town halls on steroids. They allow principals to not only address the entire online audience and take questions from audience members in front of the online audience, but also allow them to "work the room" and privately mingle with the audience members in small clusters giving high value people their couple of minutes of special attention and recognition.

[Note: there is also a green room function that allows a PA to screen people before putting them on stage with the principals.]

Constituent Outreach: In the face of increasing demands for transparency, principals can begin doing more regular online presentations. The events are controlled by the principals, providing a more reliable, constituent-friendly way to engage, and yielding video, which you can post and use across platforms.

Strategy Meetings: In responding to the daily flow, managers can convene their teams much more effectively on Shindig. Individuals can privately discuss issues that come up in real-time finding solutions to issues that may arise. All the business is conducted in one place and no second and third phone calls are needed to be made.

Opinion Research: The platform is a new rapid-fire way to achieve large scale low-cost focus groups.

Training: Motivation and GOTV tool. Shindig allows senior staff and principals deal with large groups at one time and fire them up more personally, bettering managing organizations.

Fundraising: Great for individual appeals, building in-house crowd-funding and training your staff and volunteers to domain.com contributions.

Using Shindig for fundraising more than pays for the platform. Hope to hear from you or members of your team sometime soon.

All the very best, Ellen
