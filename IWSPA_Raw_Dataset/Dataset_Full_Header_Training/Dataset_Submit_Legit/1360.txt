Today in the fight for a full and functioning Supreme Court: Republicans ar=
e hoping that Trump, the most divisive candidate in history, will win the e=
lection and appoint justices that will implement his radical agenda for the=
 country, young leaders join Members of Congress to tell Senators to #DoYou=
rJob and a new report details the impact that a domain.com Supreme Court will ha=
ve on jurisdictions across the country.

Tomorrow, the People For the American Way Foundation (PFAWF) and the Consti=
tutional Accountability Center (CAC) will release the new report, "Material=
 Harm to Our System of Justice: The Consequences of an Eight-Member Supreme=
 Court." Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Elliot Mincberg, and  Elizabeth Wydra will hol=
d a press call to discuss the new report. To RSVP or to request an embargoe=
d copy, please email user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>.

Donald Trump Wants to Use the Supreme Court to Implement His Dangerous Agen=
da.
While we have a real, highly-qualified consensus nominee that Republicans r=
efuse to act on, Trump has put forward a hypothetical group of extreme judg=
es who would do real harm to Americans by banning abortion, turning back pr=
ogress against discrimination, and imposing Trump's radical agenda on the c=
ountry.

With only eight justices, the Supreme Court has been unable to reach decisi=
ons on important issues like women's access to contraception and is set to =
accept the fewest number of new cases in 70 years, delaying or denying just=
ice to millions in the process. Just like they shut down the government, no=
w Republicans are shutting down the Supreme Court in the hopes of allowing =
Donald Trump to appoint justices who will impose his radical and divisive a=
genda on America.

Young Leaders Join Members of Congress to tell Senators: #DoYourJob.
Today, national youth-led and youth-serving organizations released an open =
letter to U.S. Senators calling for fair consideration for President Obama'=
s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. You can read the full letter and =
release HERE<<<link>>
members-congress-tell-senators-doyourjob>.
Sen. Cory Booker: "It's energizing to see so many young leaders at the fron=
t of the growing chorus of voices urging Senate leaders to do their job and=
 provide a fair process for the consideration of Chief Judge Merrick Garlan=
d. The decisions made at the Supreme Court don't just impact us today, they=
 impact generations to come."
Sen. Al Franken: "It's been more than three months now since a vacancy open=
ed on the U.S. Supreme Court, and during that time, we've seen a whole lot =
of partisan bickering, obstructionism, and political maneuvering. But you k=
now what we haven't seen: Senate Republicans doing their job as outlined by=
 the Constitution."
Rep. Ruben Gallego: "As a member of Congress who was elected to do my job, =
I take my constitutional duty seriously... It's time for the Senate to do t=
heir jobs and give Judge Garland a fair hearing and a timely vote."
Rep. Linda S=E1nchez: "This Supreme Court vacancy is critically important f=
or all Americans, but especially for Latinos living in the United States.  =
We are an especially young community with more than 14 million millennials.=
 So our message is simple: The President has done his job, now it is time f=
or Republican Senators to do their job."
Oscar Conejo, Hanover, New Hampshire: "As an undocumented student, I know j=
ust how critical the decisions are that they make on important issues that =
affect me and my family, from education to immigration and so much more."
Consuelo Hernandez, Tucson, Arizona: "I'm here today because I'm tired of c=
onservatives in the Senate choosing politics over precedent and chaos over =
constitutional duty... By choosing not to give Chief Judge Merrick Garland =
the fair and timely consideration afforded past nominees, conservatives are=
 abandoning their constitutional duties and turning their backs on the cons=
tituents like me who put them in office."
Max Levy, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: "Even though we don't always agree, w=
e work hard to foster productive dialogue on our campus. Right now, some Se=
nators are saying we shouldn't even hold a hearing for President Obama's Su=
preme Court nominee, and that's just plain wrong. Dialogue is healthy for d=
emocracy. I know that's true on my  campus, and it's true for the Senate."
Mary Marston, Concord, North Carolina: "Young people now make up the larges=
t voting bloc in America and many are just becoming politically active. It =
is critical that our elected officials follow through on their constitution=
al commitments to keep young people engaged in the democratic process."
Zach Wahls, Iowa City, Iowa: "I see the marriage between my moms-the possib=
ility of their marriage-as our legal system keeping up its end of the Ameri=
can promise to a fair hearing and due process...We got a fair hearing, and =
we need to make sure that America can get a fair hearing, too."
Mapping a Divided Court: An eight-member Supreme Court means a legal patchw=
ork across the country.
Today, the Alliance for Justice<<<link>>
ourt-2> released a memo highlighting how a deadlocked Supreme Court could m=
ean that laws will be applied differently in different parts of the country=
.

"But with only eight justices, the Supreme Court can find itself deadlocked=
 in a four-four tie. By rule, a tie vote affirms the lower court that heard=
 the case before it was appealed to the Supreme Court...a tie leaves the di=
sputed legal question unresolved, as if the Court never heard the case at a=
ll. That means that people who live in circuits that have yet to decide the=
 issue don't know what the law is, and elsewhere the same law has different=
 meanings based solely on geography...But whether the Court formally deadlo=
cks or agrees to decide nothing, the result is the same: A nationwide patch=
work of inconsistent and uncertain law, including constitutional rights tha=
t wax and wane just by crossing state lines."

The Supreme Court cannot do its job with only eight members.
