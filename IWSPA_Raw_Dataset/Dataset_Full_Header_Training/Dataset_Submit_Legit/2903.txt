For the call today
For this opportunity - all of if
For being a friend in addition to a boss

I can't tell you how happy I am we can talk again, because you still got it - I wasn't sleeping for these past few weeks (but something tells me you knew that). 

I'll spare you the sappy email for once and just say: it's not lost on me, thank you.
