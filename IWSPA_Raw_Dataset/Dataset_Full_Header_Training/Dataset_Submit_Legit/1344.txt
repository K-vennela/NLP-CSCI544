Hey Andy,

Attached is the list of donors (for your region) who have maxed the past fe=
w years but have yet to max this year. As we discussed on the Vice Chair ca=
ll today, we would like the Vice Chairs to go through these lists and see i=
f there are people you are willing to contact. We can make call sheets for =
the people you would like to call if that's preferable.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks,
Alex
