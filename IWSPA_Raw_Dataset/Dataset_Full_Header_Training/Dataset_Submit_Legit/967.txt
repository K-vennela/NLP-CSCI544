OrganizationStatement on Asian Pacific American Heritage Month

Washington - Organization Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and OrganizationAAPI Caucus Chair Bel Leong-Hong released a joint statement on Asian Pacific American Heritage Month:

"May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, an opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments and advancements of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community and the invaluable contributions they've made to our country's history. AAPIs have all too often served as unsung heroes, from the backbreaking work of Chinese laborers who helped build the Transcontinental Railroad to social justice advocates today fighting to keep immigrant families together and ensure language access at the ballot box. Our nation has been strengthened by their work, their talent, and their efforts.

"As we look back on the progress our nation has made toward equality and opportunity for all, we must also domain.com to continuing to stand up and fight, as it is far from over. The Democratic Party is proud to champion the issues that matter to the AAPI community. Our leaders stand up for economic opportunity, comprehensive immigration reform and equal pay, prioritizing educational access at all levels and working to expand access to health care, adding to the two million AAPIs that got covered are now eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. We look forward to building upon the successes of the last seven years and continuing such a legacy to the November election and well beyond."
