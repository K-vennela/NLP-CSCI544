My suggestion is that the Organizationput out a statement saying that the accusatio=
ns the Sanders campaign are not true.  The fact that CNN notes that you are=
n=92t getting between the two campaigns is the problem.  Here, Sanders is a=
ttacking the Organizationand its current practice, its past practice with the POTUS=
 and with Sec Kerry.  Just as the RNC pushes back directly on Trump over =
=93rigged system=94, the Organizationshould push back DIRECTLY at Sanders and say t=

Jake Tapper: Jeff, is there anything to the Sanders charge of money launder=

Jeff Zeleny: Well Jake, the term money laundering is definitely strong. The=
re is nothing to that exact phrase. The Clinton campaign believes that the =
Sanders campaign is trying to fire up their own donors here. One official c=
alled it shameful. But there are some concerns from state party officials w=
here their money is. This comes from a joint fundraising account, the Hilla=
ry Victory Fund, it's a joint account that she raises money for her campaig=
n, the national party, the state party. Some of the state parties have not =
seen as much money as they thought they would. Bernie Sanders could be rais=
ing money like this as well. He's decided not to do this. This is just the =
beginning of this here. Some state parties want their money so they can use=
 it for their own local races.

The Bernie Sanders campaign is accusing Democratic presidential front-runne=
r Hillary Clinton of =93looting=94 money from a joint account meant in part=
 for state parties, the latest brawl between the camps over precious fundra=
ising dollars in the closing weeks of their primary race. The dispute is ov=
er the Hillary Victory Fund, established by Clinton last summer and compris=
ing her presidential campaign, the Organization and 32 sta=
te party committees. The joint effort so far has raised $61 million, but on=
ly 1 percent ultimately stayed in state party accounts, according to an ana=
lysis by Politico of federal election records. The analysis, which was chal=
lenged by the Clinton campaign, said the fund had transferred $3.8 million =
to the state parties, then quickly transferred $3.3 million of the money to=
 the DNC.
=85

Schwerin also said the operations are being run jointly by the Organizationand stat=
e parties =93to elect progressives across the country in November." To be s=
ure, raising money may become more challenging as the campaigns drag on -- =
and when the prevailing candidate shifts to a general election battle. The =
Sanders campaign, for example, reportedly raised $25.8 million in April, do=
wn from $44 million in March and $43.5 million in February. Clinton reporte=
dly raised $26.4 million last month. The Sanders campaign signed a similar =
joint-fundraising agreement with the Organizationthat appears largely inactive. How=
ever, he has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars through his donor list=
 for several progressive House candidates, according to Politico. This is n=
ot the first time the Sanders campaign has accused the Clinton camp of fund=
raising shenanigans. Last month, the campaign sent an open letter to the DN=
C accusing the Clinton campaign of "apparent violations" in fundraising.

he won=92t shy away from a fight. The Sanders campaign escalated its condem=
nation of the Clinton campaign=92s fundraising methods on Monday, seizing o=

 charge highlights a broader divide between the rival candidates. Clinton h=

party loyalty, and individuals above institutions. He has elevated the prof=
ile of a select pool of progressive Democratic candidates fighting for elec=
tion to Congress, and cultivated a grassroots network of intensely-devoted =
small-dollar donors. The trigger for the Sanders campaign=92s most recent c=
riticism was a deep dive from Politico into the inner-workings of the Hilla=
ry Victory Fund, a fundraising venture for the Clinton campaign, the Democr=
atic National Committee, and 32 state Democratic parties. It found that sta=

Sen. Bernie Sanders is planning on taking his presidential bid all the way =
to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this summer. And it l=
ooks like his rhetorical shots at Democratic presidential rival Hillary Cli=
nton will go with him. Leading up to Indiana's primary on Tuesday, Sanders =
has proved more than willing to continue drawing contrasts with Clinton on =
major issues. During a Monday campaign rally in Indiana, Sanders reiterated=
 his usual attacks on Clinton's campaign-finance structure, pausing for boo=
s and cracking jokes about Clinton's private speeches to Goldman Sachs. "We=
 said, 'Hell no' to super PACs. We don't represent Wall Street or the billi=
onaire class," Sanders said.

On Monday, the Sanders campaign and the Republican National Committee blast=
ed out to reporters a Politico story within four minutes of each other. The=
 story said that the Clinton campaign has benefited massively from the mone=
y it has raised for Democratic state parties, which have received comparati=
vely little in return. "Secretary Clinton has exploited the rules in ways t=
hat let her high-dollar donors like Alice Walton of Walmart fame and the ac=
tor George Clooney and his super-rich Hollywood friends skirt legal limits =
on campaign contributions," Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said. He a=
dded an apparent reference to a line from the Politico story that quoted st=

"If Secretary Clinton can't raise the funds needed to run in a competitive =
primary without resorting to laundering, how will she compete against Donal=
