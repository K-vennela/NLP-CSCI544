Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert was sentenced to 15 months in prison on Wednesday in Chicago for violating banking laws in a hush-money case, allegedly to cover up past sexual misconduct as a high school wrestling coach. During his testimony, Hastert admitted to "mistreating" some boys on his team decades ago.

The terms of the sentence also include two years of supervised release.

Hastert pleaded guilty last October to federal charges that he had improperly structured $1.7 million in withdrawals to pay a former student as compensation for the alleged past abuse and that he had lied to FBI agents investigating the matter.

The former Illinois Republican lawmaker had agreed to pay $3.5 million in total to that person, known as "Individual A" in court papers. That person sued Hastert on Monday for failing to pay the remaining $1.8 million.
