That's your perception, and it's wrong. He's not delivering on media monitoring, and I'm going to push him on that. But he has been a rock star on the bookings, and it has paid off big time with our presence with Brooklyn and the networks, and for the Organizationto look serious. I asked him to book you more on radio to get you up to speed, so you too will domain.com from that. We had a shitty booking operation before, we're more than competitive now. It's not nothing.

Less concerned about TJ, who delivers.
More concerned about morale on the team when they see Pablo fucking up and being let off the hook, and they see him not coming in to work with no pushback.
Nobody wants to get up and monitor coverage on a Sunday morning but it's part of the job. If they see others on the team ignore responsibility with impunity, they will start following domain.com.

I'm not sure it'll hold with TJ. You've given him warnings, so just hold on to the prior documentation, in case you need it again.

Just me talking to him. Not sure that approach will work with Pablo.

Meaning since HR raised it with him? Or just you talking to him. If he's listening to you now, that's great.

He hasn't taken an unexcused absence since I brought it up.
