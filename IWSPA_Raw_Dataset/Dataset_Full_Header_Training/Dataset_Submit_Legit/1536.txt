Demanding a retraction from NYT?
- We're talking to NYT
- It was a total con job

How big an issue should Bill Clinton [and affairs] be in the campaign? The =
fondling, the assualt--?

- Says he is a Constitutionalist
- Wanted to put list out to quell fears over his conservatism because he is=
 from New York
- Says Federalist Society and Sessions vetted

You're still doing OK in your financials?
- I want to give back, put back... Make America great again

Balanced budget?
- Some people say in 20 years, way less than that

Obamacare?
- You don't even have to repeal it, will collapse of its own weight
- New numbers on Obamacare will come out in November right before the elect=
ion and they are trying to change it
- Open it up to competition
