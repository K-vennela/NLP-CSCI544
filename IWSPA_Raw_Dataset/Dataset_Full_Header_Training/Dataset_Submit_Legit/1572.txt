Dear Ahmed

Thanks for your e-mail.

Can you please let me know the platforms that are you interesting in? Are you interesting as well in all infection vectors?

I suggest to you to have a look on the quotation that I sent to you a couple of hours before and extract from it the information that I need to issue to you the quotation. Otherwise give me until tomorrow afternoon and I will send to you all the requirements
 to allow me to issue a quotation.

Best regards
