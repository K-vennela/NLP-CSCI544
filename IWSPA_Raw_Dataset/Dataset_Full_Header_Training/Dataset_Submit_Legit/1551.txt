One of his longest speeches I've seen in a while
Repeatedly brought up the need to get to 1,237 and that he only cares about=
 the 1st ballot

Trump Rally in Hagerstown MD at 4pm

Maryland jobs down
- Happens to correlate with Congressional vote to allow China into WTO
- Manufacturing jobs disappearing

Build a wall
- Believe me, that wall will be built

Unfair system
- Abraham Lincoln couldn't have broken 50% with 17 people running
- Don't care about 2nd-3rd ballots
- Cruz is a liar. Never dealt with someone who can lie like that

My folks were meeting with the RNC.
- Boats and yachts waiting to take delegates around. I want to become a del=
egate
- Cruz is wining and dining. He is bribing people essentially
- Cruz can't do it on the first ballot. I only care about the first ballot

Dishonest media
- Might be even worse than lyin' Ted

Kasich
- Blames "phony" poll for forcing him to campaign in FL instead of OH
- He's a nice guy, but he shouldn't running

Self-funding
- Spent the least, but am winning

Again talks about how many companies he has in Delaware

Did well in the South even though Cruz was supposed to
- Threatens to move to AL if he doesn't win Maryland
- Evangelicals don't like Cruz

Cruz is working really hard to-- I don't want to use the word 'bribe'-- to =
bribe delegates
- They are trying to steal it on the 4th ballot from the guy who was on the=
 cover of TIME magazine as part of the biggest political movement
- If it goes to a 2nd or 3rd ballot, I'm winning by millions of votes

Kasich winning a little bit over Hillary
- Hasn't had any negative ads
- I have 55,000 negative ads run against me: "It has to be true, I saw it o=
n Fox"

Probably will win all 5 states on Tuesday
- Complaining about unfair system in PA

Crooked Hillary Clinton vs the Communist
- This guy [Bernie] is crazy
- He wants to take 100% of your money in taxes
- If you look at his tax return, maybe that's why he made so little
- I really want to 'fight' Hillary
- Election between Crooked Hillary and Wonderful Donald would have the high=
est turnout

They talk about changing personality and looking presidential
- I think I look really good
- Says he thinks he looks better than Kasich
- I knocked out all of these people, no one else did
- I don't like Cruz now, but in a few weeks, I think he'll be my best frien=
d
- You think this is easy? Ranting and raving

Like my opponents after they are defeated
- I beat Jeb and Walker who were supposed to win
- Compliments Marco

We have to be careful about changing
- Would be a shame if we became presidential and started losing
- Nobody is the history of political parties has had so many opponents

Nikki Haley was against me
- Turned out to be an asset because she is weak on borders

Unfair to say you need the 1,237
- Very hard when you had all these people running
- "Think I'm gonna get there. So I'm not complaining about it. Although I a=
m."
- I don't get what Kasich is doing. If he wasn't in the race in NY, I would=
 have got 90%

Cruz is buying all these delegates
- Can you imagine if we got to a 3rd or 4th ballot and he won?

If I lose, I don't think you're ever going to see me again
- These other politicians are vicious to each other, then when one loses, t=
hey say the other one will be great

On the cover of TIME magazine with you people
- I think I have great hair. No bald spot

Can't build the wall if you don't vote for me on Tuesday

Can you imagine if someone with millions of votes less got the nomination?
- We don't want violence, but we have the most loyal supporters

Doesn't matter unless we win
- We have to beat Crooked Hillary
- She's as crooked as they come

Carrier Air Conditioning
- Trump says if he were president, not one company would leave the country
- Some might leave the state, but that's different, that's OK because we lo=
ve our country
- Don't need incentives to keep them here (loans, abatements, etc.), just t=
hreaten to tax them
- China and Mexico are abusing us

Trade
- Trump admits tariffs will make products more expensive: "Maybe a little, =
maybe a lot."
- We will create millions of jobs, so it washes out
- Watching a bully getting beat up is almost more said than watching a norm=
al person

We don't have many protesters anymore because we dealt with them properly
- We might have to get some of our own so they show the crowds

Says some people have said such vicious things
- My mom would cry if she was still around
- Now these same people want to endorse

Build the wall
- It will be taller than the ceiling
- I build great buildings. Buildings are harder to build than wall

Putin said great things about me
- Why would I disavow it? I agree

Lindsey Graham
- He's a nice guy, but was upset because I beat him so badly
- He keeps endorsing people and they keep losing

We need unpredictability

You're going to go vote on Tuesday
- We need a mandate
- We're like fighters. If we knock them out, the judges don't matter
- We will take out Hillary. We will hit her hard. We haven't focused on her=
 yet

Win, win, win
