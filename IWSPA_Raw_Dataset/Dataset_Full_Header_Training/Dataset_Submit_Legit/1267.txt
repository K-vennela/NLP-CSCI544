Research pls take another look.

"Mike Pence's endorsement of Ted Cruz is no surprise as both politicians have built their careers obsessing over a social agenda rather than focusing on economic ones most important to Hoosiers. After Mike Pence signed the embarrassing and unnecessary RFRA law that could cost our state $250 million and will continue to scare jobs away from Indiana, Ted Cruz supported the governor and advocated that the federal government adopt a similar law. Mike Pence signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation; Ted Cruz has said rape victims should be forced to carry pregnancies to term. Ted Cruz has campaigned for president on an extremist, divisive ideology, and Mike Pence has put that same extreme ideology into practice, causing Indiana to fall behind the rest of the nation. This endorsement may grab headlines, but Mike Pence has said he would vote for whoever is the Republican nominee - even if it's Donald Trump." - Indiana Chairman John Zody
