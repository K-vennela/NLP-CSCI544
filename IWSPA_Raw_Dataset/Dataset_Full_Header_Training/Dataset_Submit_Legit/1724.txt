Hi Mesfer

Thanks for your fast re-action.

About the maintenance, let me suggest to you to consider the Attack Vecktor Service fee as well to allow the customer to be more powerfull in it's action on infect the target. ( We are speaking about the 0 Day domain.com). Based on our experience this service
 is really appreciate from the customer point of view. But this will be you final decision. Let me know your final decision and I will revert to you with the quotation asap.

I'm confident to recevied the pending amount as per your suggestion, really appreciate.

Right now I can't confirm you any available dates due the fact we need to check with the department dedicated.

Hi Emad,

Thanks for your email.

Send me an official quotation for the yearly maintenance only.

For the deducted TAX amount, I’m following up with our finance and you will receive it before this Thursday. What I need from you is a confirmation that your team is available in your side to conduct the advanced training in Italy within the last two weeks
 of Jun as per our client’s preference.

Best Regards,

Dear Mr. Mesfer,
I’m Emad Shehata, nice to meet you.
As per the e-mail sent by our Sales Manager (see you here below) regarding the still open financial issue, I'd like to inform you that the Yearly Maintenance
 and the domain.com Service (now called Attack Vector Service) will expire on 31 May 2014.



The delivery was performed on January 2013, and expiration date should have been on January 2015 but, agreed by the parties, was extended until 31 of
 May 2014.



After the expiration the customer will able to use the product and receive data from targets but not to make new infections, not to receive new updates
 not the ticket support.
Based on the agreement we have in place, I would summarize the costs of the maintenance renewal fee and the Attack Vector Service fee:



Yearly Maintenance fee                              € 114.000,00                                      ( 20% of € 570.000,00 that it was the Total Amount
 of the PO)
Attack Vecktor Service fee                          €  50.000,00                                      (as reported in the original offer signed by you)
Total Amount                                                   € 164.000,00 




Please let me know if you need a formal Offer in order to arrange your PO before the expiration date.



Best regards

For the future communications, please keep my colleague Emad Shehata or myself as reference. You can find our contact details below.

Before confirm the training we need you to solve the financial issue. I'm summarizing the situation of the last invoices:

Please keep us informed.

Dear Mesfer,

Hope you are doing well.

I just got a call from our financial department and unfortunately the situation regarding the official receipt for the tax deduction is becoming
 critical.

Can you please update me and advise how to proceed?

Thank you and best regards,

Mostapha

Dear Mesfer,

Thank you in advance for the final payment.




As I told you before, this deduction will be rejected from our financial department without an
official receipt. BTW, why is it 15% this time and not 5%?

Anyway, would you be available for a call tomorrow morning?

Thank you,

Mostapha
