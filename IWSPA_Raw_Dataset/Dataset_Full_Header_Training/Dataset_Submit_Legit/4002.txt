Dear OrganizationMember,

The Republican Party is in chaos. In less than a week since becoming the GOP's presumptive nominee, Donald Trump continues to take reckless and dangerous positions. Not only has he been continually criticized<<<link>>> from all sides on his refusal to release his tax returns, his own tax plan is irresponsible<<<link>>>. While he claims that the wealthy will "probably going to end up paying more," in reality his tax plan would give the top .1% an average tax cut of over $1 million. Furthermore, Trump continues to express ongoing support<<<link>>> for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. It is clear that he does not have the temperament or judgement needed to occupy the White House.

2016 is going so badly for the RNC that they put out a second autopsy<<<link>>> over the weekend. Donald Trump defended<<<link>>> his comments that Senator John McCain was not war hero, saying "there are many people that like what I said. You know after I said that, my poll numbers went up seven points." His reckless temperament and divisive rhetoric will backfire on Republicans. While the list of Republican leaders who refuse to support Donald Trump<<<link>>> continues to grow longer, and domain.com polls indicate that Republican voters believe their primaries have been divisive, 75% of Democrats say they are excited and energized by our primaries. The Democratic candidates for President are substantive and are sharing a message for moving American forward. The contrast couldn't be clearer.

Finally, Republican Senator Jeff Flake admitted this week that if the Republicans lose the presidential election they "ought to approve [Chief Judge Garland] quickly." In response<<<link>>> to this statement, OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said, "Senator Flake's comments are a reminder that Republicans are playing political games with the Supreme Court. Chief Judge Garland is the most qualified nominee to immediately serve on the Supreme Court, with more federal judicial experience than any other nominee in history, he should get a fair hearing and a vote."

Have a safe and happy weekend.
Best,
Stephanie
