Hi Joanna, the Chair of the Organization, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, will be in Los Angeles on Wednesday May 4th. She's a fan of Jimmy Kimmel's and so if you're not entirely booked up for that night let me know if he'd want to have her on for a few minutes.

If you want to talk by phone about possibilities, let me know. Best regards, - User.
