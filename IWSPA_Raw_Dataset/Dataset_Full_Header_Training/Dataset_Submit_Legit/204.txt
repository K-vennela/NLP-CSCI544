Hi,

In the master node error log I have one error that is repeating many times per day. I noticed that when this error occurs in the same time I have email from the system that The component 'RCS::ANON::XXX' is now active.

It looks like system can't get response from anon and generate error, and when anon response, system is sending email.

Is this alright?

log and email in attachment.

best regards
