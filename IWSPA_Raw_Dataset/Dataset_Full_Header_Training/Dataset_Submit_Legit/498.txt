*MEDIA ADVISORY*

TOMORROW, April 27th at 10:00 AM ET: Democrats Host Media Call To Discuss the Catastrophic Implications of a Trump Presidency
Throughout his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump has made consistently ignorant and alarming statements and taken positions that jeopardize Americans domestically and abroad. Despite 73 straight months of private sector job growth, he has peddled utter fiction in predicting a recession and warned against investing in the stock market. He has threatened to pull back from NATO, refused to say that he wouldn't use nuclear weapons in Europe, and even said that he would punish women who obtain abortions.

Tomorrow, OrganizationChair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Congressman Seth Moulton (MA) and Congressman Ted Lieu (CA) will host a media call to discuss the catastrophic implications of a Trump presidency, in advance of Donald Trump's foreign policy speech at the National Press Club.

WHO: OrganizationChair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Congressman Seth Moulton and Congressman Ted Lieu
WHAT: Media Call
WHEN: TOMORROW, April 27th at 10:00 AM ET
RSVP: Please email Jenna Price, user@domain.com for dial-in information
