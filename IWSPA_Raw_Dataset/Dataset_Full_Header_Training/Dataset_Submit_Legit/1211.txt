Do we want to give Mike Allen some more dates for a possible Playbook breakfast with DWS?

When we couldn't do a joint one last time with Reince, he just had Reince on solo.

Not sure Mike would be interested in doing her as a solo guest but I can always ask.

That said, is there any news we want to make? Mike will certainly push hard for her to create a headline or two. If DWS definitely wants to do it, we should try to line up an event now before we need to get approval from the campaign for things like this.
