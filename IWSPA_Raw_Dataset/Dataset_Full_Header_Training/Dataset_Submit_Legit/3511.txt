These were pulled from our last set of TPs plus Shu-Yen's script and have been signed off by AFT. Research pls double check.

Thanks

*         I am proud to lead the American Federation of Teachers, a union of 1.6 million education professionals.

*         We are a union of professionals that champions fairness; democracy; economic opportunity; and high-quality public education, healthcare and public services for our students, their families and our communities.

*         This week, we celebrate Teacher Appreciation Week. But unfortunately I need to speak with you about someone who doesn't appreciate teachers: Donald Trump.

*         We all know Trump has disparaged and denigrated women, Latinos, and Muslims, among other large swaths of the public.

*         Trump doesn't respect teachers or the education profession either.

*         Trump has called for eliminating the department of education.

*         He has fleeced students with his fraudulent Trump University scheme.

*         Trump has embraced the type of so-called reforms that de-professionalize and disrespect teachers. He would eliminate seniority and weaken our ability to negotiate contracts.

*         Let's remember that one of Trump's top surrogates, and possible running-mates, is Chris Christie.

*         Chris Christie as governor has been vehemently anti-teacher. We all remember the YouTube video of Christie screaming at a teacher during a town hall meeting.

*         Christie suggested last year that teachers should be making minimum wage<<<link>>>, after he vetoed and stood against<<<link>>> minimum wage increases.

*         As an aside, Chris Christie's polling numbers have dropped to 26 27 percent since he endorsed Trump. To put that in context - that's only two three points better than Richard Nixon's approval rating on the day he resigned from the presidency.

*         You might know that XX% 60% of the workers who make up our union are women.

*         Donald Trump is viewed unfavorably by 7 out of 10 women, and he's given them plenty of reason.

*         Last month we marked Equal Pay Day, the day in 2015 when women's earnings have caught up with men's earnings from 2015. On average, women earn 79 cents to their dollar, and it's worse for women of color. But Trump doesn't support closing this gap with legislation.

*         Instead, Donald Trump said that women would have pay equity if they did 'as good a job' as men.

*         Donald Trump simply doesn't have the judgment or temperament to be President, and the American people know it.

*         For years, GOP leaders have pushed a cynical and feckless political strategy that exploits unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all for political gain.

*         They have sold hardworking Americans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while strangling America's middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich those already at the top.

*         Donald Trump's impending nomination after Tuesday's results is the ultimate, sad culmination of the success of that strategy. Trump is the modern Republican Party.

*         Trump's Republican opponents didn't stand up to him because after years of elevating extreme voices in their party, they didn't want to alienate them.

*         The Republican establishment is having trouble coming to terms with their nominee, and even some of them are acknowledging Trump is dangerous and lacks the judgment to be Commander in Chief.

*         Thank you.
