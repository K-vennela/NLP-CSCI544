In Indiana, Cruz Mocks Trump's "Battles with Venereal Disease"<<<link>>>

<<link>>

by Patrick Svitek

Bracing for a devastating loss in Indiana's primary, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is throwing the kitchen sink at frontrunner Donald Trump.

Hours before the polls close Tuesday in the Hoosier State, Cruz promised to tell reporters at a stop in Evansville "what I really think of Donald Trump" - before unloading on the billionaire as a "pathological liar," "utterly amoral" and a "serial philanderer."

"He doesn't know the difference between truth and lies," Cruz said in remarks that were broadcast live on national TV. "He lies - practically every word that comes out of his mouth. And in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying."

Cruz continued: "The man cannot tell the truth, but he combines with it being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don't think this country has ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and goes, 'Dude, what's your problem?'"

Cruz did not let up, going on to call Trump "utterly amoral" while making reference to the billionaire's attacks on Cruz's wife. "Morality does not exist for him," Cruz said of Trump.

"Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it," Cruz told reporters, referring to remarks Trump made to radio personality Howard Stern in 1997. "This is not a secret. He's proud of being a serial philanderer. I want everyone to think about your teenage kids. The president of the United States talks about how great it is to domain.com adultery, how proud he is, describes his battles with venereal disease as his own personal Vietnam."

Cruz's remarks came the same morning that Trump, in a TV interview, invoked a tabloid report that tied Cruz's dad Rafael to the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy. Cruz has previously denied the story.

On Tuesday, he mocked Trump's allegation.

"Let's be clear: This is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is kooky," Cruz said in Evansville. "While I'm at it, I should go ahead and domain.com yes, my dad killed JFK, he is secretly Elvis and Jimmy Hoffa is buried in his backyard."
