Thanks. See my note about messaging (infrastructure, guns vs. tax returns) for next week re Zac. Just let me know best way to proceed.

How about this for a quote? Don't want to give her anything else:

"We have spent significant time and resources building out our infrastructure and operations in perennial battleground states like North Carolina. Come November, we are confident that North Carolinians will embrace the forward-looking agenda of our nominee and reject the divisive and reckless positions of Donald Trump." - Mark Paustenbach, OrganizationNational Press Secretary

FYI -  RNC has provided some details about their operations on the ground in NC so I would like to offer counterpoint from the Organizationif available.

I'm wrapping up the North Carolina story - is there anything you can say for use in print about the importance of the state this cycle, what operations you have put in place there or why it might flip again for the Democratic nominee in 2016?
