Expanding Overtime Pay

*         Since he took office, the President has worked to ensure that our=
 economy rewards hard work and responsibility. That's why, today, the Admin=
istration is updating and strengthening overtime pay rules to make sure mil=
lions more Americans are paid fairly.

*         Every week, millions of Americans work more than 40 hours but do =
not receive the overtime pay they deserve.

*         And since 1975, the share of full-time workers automatically qual=
ifying for overtime based on their salaries has plummeted from 62 percent t=
o 7 percent today. In short, this important policy has not kept up with the=
 times.

*         The President is fixing that. At his direction, the Department of=
 Labor is taking action to:

o   Extend overtime protections to 4.2 million additional workers who are n=
ot currently eligible for overtime under federal law.  They will now be eli=
gible for overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours in a week.

o   Raise the salary threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 a year, or from $455=
 to $913 a week.

o   Raise Americans' wages by an estimated $12 billion over the next 10 yea=
rs, with an average increase of $1.2 billion annually.

o   Update the salary threshold every three years to ensure it does not ero=
de.

o   Raise the "highly compensated employee" threshold - from $100,000 to $1=
34,004 - above which only a minimal showing is needed to demonstrate an emp=
loyee is not eligible for overtime.

o   Respond to employers' concerns by making no changes to the "duties test=
" and allowing bonuses and incentive payments to count toward up to 10 perc=
ent of the new salary level.

*         Today's action takes into account input from 270,000 public comme=
nts and extensive outreach meetings with workers, employers, and concerned =
citizens.

*         The President will continue fighting to grow our economy and ensu=
re that an honest day's work should get a fair day's pay.
