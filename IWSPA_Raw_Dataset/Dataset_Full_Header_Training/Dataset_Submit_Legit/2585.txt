Continued Economic Progress - And Combatting Money Laundering, Corruption a=
nd Tax Evasion

*         Today, the President highlighted that our economy continues to gr=
ow: April marked the 74th consecutive month of private sector job growth in=
 America.  Over that record streak of job growth, our businesses have creat=
ed 14.6 million new jobs in all.  Unemployment is falling and wages are ris=
ing.

*         That's real progress, but the President made clear that there's m=
ore work to do - and too many Americans are still hurting. That's why he ca=
lled on Republicans in Congress to do their part and take common-sense step=
s to help working Americans.

o   To create new jobs, they should invest in our infrastructure - our road=
s, bridges, and schools.

o   To reward some of the hardest-working people in America, they should ra=
ise the minimum wage.

o   To level the playing field for American workers and crack down on unfai=
r foreign competition, they should pass smart new trade agreements.

o   And they should reform our tax code to promote growth and job creation,=
 close wasteful loopholes, and simplify the tax code for everybody.

*         Only Congress can fully close the loopholes that wealthy individu=
als and powerful corporations can take advantage of, often at the expense o=
f middle-class families. The President has put forward plans to do just tha=
t, but because Congress likely won't act on those plans, the Administration=
 will continue to do what it can on its own to make the tax system fairer.

*         Today, the President built on those efforts by:

o   Requiring banks and other financial institutions to know, verify, and r=
eport who the real people are behind shell corporations that set up account=
s at those institutions.

o   Second, we're plugging a gap in our tax rules that foreigners can explo=
it to hide their assets to evade taxes.  The Treasury Department and the IR=
S are issuing a proposed rule to make sure foreigners can't hide behind ano=
nymous shell companies formed inside the U.S.

*         Taken together, these steps go a long way in helping to combat mo=
ney laundering and tax evasion, but additional tools are needed to promote =
transparency and strengthen law enforcement. And only Congress can help on =
that front, so the President will continue to push Congress to do their par=
t and:

o   Pass legislation to require "beneficial ownership" transparency.

o   Pass legislation to give law enforcement additional anti-corruption too=
ls.

o   Approve eight tax treaties that have been pending for years to give U.S=
. officials a complete set of tools to fully investigate and crack down on =
tax evasion by Americans with offshore accounts.

o   Strengthen existing law to improve reciprocal transparency.
