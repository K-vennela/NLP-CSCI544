That hasn't always been the case. We've had comms staffers at ASDC meetings before, especially when we are anticipating a reporter presence. This one might get particular attention given larger factors at play.

Jonae added that they typically don't have a communications staffer attend the ASDC meetings. Usually someone from comms only goes to staff the Chair.

According to Jonae, it is open press but the DNCC session on Friday morning is closed.

User has advised that him or Mark will be accompanying the chair.
