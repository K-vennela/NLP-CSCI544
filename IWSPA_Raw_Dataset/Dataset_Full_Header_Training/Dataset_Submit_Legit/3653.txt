Alexis at RCP is writing on what Earnest said, that POTUS will be more engaged beginning in Summer. She wants to know if we can expect him to be more visible on campaign trail in June. Let me know what you want us to say. On background I made the usual points about him being a particularly powerful voice given strong record, 74 mos of job growth vs 800,000 jobs lost per month, etc.. I also pointed out that his support since 2015 has been helping us build the national infrastructure, voter file, support for state parties, etc... so the usual.

Let us know if there's anything in particular you'd want us to highlight --- especially on the record.
