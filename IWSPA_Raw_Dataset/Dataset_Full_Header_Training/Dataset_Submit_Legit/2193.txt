Is there a time we could meet after 3:30pm today?

Here are the type of questions they are going to ask:

Our intention is to provide the interested public --in a year of peak inter=
est in campaign politics- with as full an accounting as possible of how pre=
dictive modeling works.  We at the Graduate School of Political Management =
like to say that we focus on the "how" and not the "who" or "what" of domain.com=
ics.  This approach has enabled us to attract practitioners and students fr=
om Democrats, Republicans, third parties, and parties in other countries.

So while we would be delighted to hear about persuasion models in use in pr=
evious cycles, we certainly don't expect you to go public with information =
about specific candidates and contests this cycle.

That said, we would like you to go beyond the case studies and slide decks =
on your web sites.  Dan and Scott: take us step by step in how a persuasion=
 model is constructed, tested, sold to clients such as Sam and Jesse, imple=
mented, and then refined.  Sam and Jesse: as you make models available to s=
tate parties and candidates, how do they react (I imagine there is a range =
of reactions), and how do you work with those who embrace models to impleme=
nt them and learn from the implementations?

In addition to step-by-step details, step back and tell us your assessment =
of the state of voter persuasion modeling in an historical context, say 201=
0 to 2020.  Has progress been made?  Are there persistent obstacles?  What'=
s the near future look like?

TP=92s below =96 let me know if you need anything else.

DVTF

We=92re focused right now on the presidential, but we=92re also looking ahe=
ad, to building the long-term infrastructure our party needs to be successf=
ul.

=B7         We can be proud as Democrats of what we=92ve achieved, winning =
the White House the last two presidential elections, but also what we=92ve =
been able to do over the last 7 years under Democratic leadership.

=B7         But the landscape has been much tougher to Democrats down the b=
allot. Since 2008, we=92ve lost 69 House seats, 13 Senate seats, more than =
900 state legislative seats, 30 state legislative chambers and 11 governors=
hips.

=B7         We lost our majorities in Congress in 2010, and despite making =
significant investments, 2015 was a tough year.

So early last year the Chair commissioned a Democratic Victory Task Force t=
o look at what we needed to do as a Party in a holistic way.

=B7         We wanted to build toward another White House victory, but we r=
ecognized that there was a major need to protect and build on our strengths=
, and fix our weaknesses.

=B7         The Task Force issued a set of recommendations and this past No=
vember we released their final report and Action Plan.

Here=92s what you need to know about that, and what it means.

  *   The Organizationhas reinvigorated our State Party Partnerships, to ensure tha=
t we are supporting Democrats in all 50 states.
  *   We=92re investing in infrastructure to ensure that the hard work and =
knowledge our teams build up in every campaign continue to help Democrats i=
n the next cycle, and the one after that.
  *   And we want more voices involved all across the country, helping tell=
 the story of our party, its values, and how Democratic leadership is affec=
ting the lives of millions.

Voter File

More than ten years ago the Organizationbegan a national voter file, so that every =
state party works together =96 so we know where our voters are.

That gave us a powerful edge over Republicans, who have a completely fragme=
nted approach to their voter files. And it made the difference in 2015 and =
2012.

Now, for the first time ever, all of our major Presidential Primary campaig=
ns had access to our voter file from the beginning. That means that both of=
 our major campaigns started this election with a better voter file than Pr=
esident Obama=92s team had at the end of 2012.

And because they=92re both using it,

  *   every single door that our candidates have knocked on
  *   every single phone call their volunteers have made,
  *   every voter contact at a town hall or county fair=85
=85Is now a part of our national database and is going to make a tremendous=
 difference for whoever emerges as our nominee.

And in 2014, we expanded our data-sharing agreement to include campaigns do=
wn ballot, so it=92s not just the presidential campaigns that domain.com, it=
=92s our entire party.

We=92re also modernizing the Party in other ways

  *   Since 2013, we have quintupled the size of our digital team, to boost=
 fundraising and provide training and support to our state parties.
  *   We=92ve organized a team of experts in messaging, branding, and polli=
ng to review the way we communicate, and we=92ve built an in-house Communic=
ations team to hold Republicans accountable every single day.
  *   We=92ve built out a state-of-the-art media monitoring operation to tr=
ack and inform our rapid response operation.
  *   And our teams are providing training, disseminating best practices, s=
haring technology and design assets, and building community among State Par=
ty staff and the rest of the Democratic family.

Trump Contrast

  *   Trump won=92t rely on data, just earned media and large rallies:

     *   Republicans have already buried their post-2012 autopsy report=92s=
 calls for inclusiveness, so it=92s not surprising that Donald Trump is als=
o dumping their efforts at data and analytics.
     *   Democrats are happy to maintain the substantial digital edge we=92=
ve had in the last two presidential elections, and we=92re going to continu=
e to build on our ability to engage and understand voters.
     *   Remember that Hillary Clinton has earned 2 million more votes than=
 Trump, and Bernie Sanders earned more votes than Ted Cruz and John Kasich =
through last week=92s primaries, so we won=92t argue with Mr. Trump=92s str=
ategy.

Q&A:
Primary on Dem side

=B7         We=92re working with both of our campaigns and have always been=
 neutral.

Sanders Campaign domain.com:

=B7         It has been dismissed, there=92s nothing to add beyond the offi=
cial statements our senior staff made.

Data integrity post December incident:

  *   We=92ve moved past it and working well with both of our campaigns, AN=
D campaigns up and down the ballot. All of that is feeding into our modelin=
g heading into the general election, which gives us a big advantage over th=
e GOP, who have not been using the same list, don=92t have agreements with =
all the states, and have had a fragmented approach to the interfaces their =
campaigns have used.

What about the separate October incident the Sanders camp had flagged?

     *   We=92re confident in the integrity of our system. [Pivot to=85] Ou=
r data edge gives us an enormous edge over Republicans up and down the ball=
ot.

Being taken over by presumptive nominee

  *   We=92re working with both campaigns. Above my pay grade on the how an=
d when, but because we=92re well integrated with both already, it should be=
 seamless.

Hi Tom, Sam MCabe is going to speak at a Microsoft panel next week that is =
open press. He has his core tech/data file talking points, but we need to g=
ive him some of the general points on the following. Can you please flesh i=
t out for him with our stock language? Thanks.

=B7         DVTF --- national voter file

=B7         Investing in states and infrastructure

=B7         Confident we=92ll be united, and both of our candidates have be=

And Q&A for what NOT to talk about:

both of our campaigns and have always been neutral.
