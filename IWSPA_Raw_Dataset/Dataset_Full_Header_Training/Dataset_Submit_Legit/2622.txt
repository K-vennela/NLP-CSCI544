Interesting line from the Speaker. Wonder if he thinks voter ID and anti-LGBT laws are inclusive too...

"I want to show people that conservatism is actually a very inclusive and aspirational mindset. It's a happy way of life.

"But more importantly, how our principles-applied to the problems of the day-provide the best and most enduring solutions that give young people more control over their lives and their destiny and guarantee a more prosperous future."
