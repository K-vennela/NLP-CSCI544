That's right.  There is no meeting so we are good.

So since there's no actual meeting we don't need to advise it to press, right?

Dear OrganizationExecutive Committee Member,

The Executive Committee Convention walkthrough is just about upon us.  Many of you have reached out to my office with questions about the detailed schedule, so I wanted to make sure we provided you with that information below as you make your travel plans.

If you still haven't made arrangements with the Radisson Blu Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square and are intending to come to Philadelphia for the walkthrough, you can either have my office book the room on your behalf by responding to this email with the dates you'd like to reserve the hotel for (and we will make the reservation on your behalf), OR you can make individual reservations by calling the hotel reservations director, Kelly Kelly directly at (215) 789-6103.  Please note: the lower room block rate for our hotel has officially passed.

As a reminder, since the Executive Committee conducted this quarter's business in a special phone meeting in February, there will be no meeting taking place in Philadelphia, just the Convention walkthrough.  This will be the last opportunity for Executive Committee Members to get an advance walkthrough of the Convention facilities prior to the Convention in July.

Please see the schedule below for your reference,

Best,

Stephanie
