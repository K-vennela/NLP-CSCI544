OrganizationTalking Points on the Ted Cruz / Carly Fiorina Ticket

*         This is a desperate attempt by a desperate campaign to change the=
 narrative after netting only a single delegate in last night's contests.

*         By selecting a VP candidate when he is less than halfway to the n=
omination, Ted Cruz is even more delusional than John Kasich, who has only =
won his home state, and Marco Rubio, who gave a victory speech after a thir=
d place finish in Iowa.

*         It's fitting that Senator Cruz, best known for shutting down the =
U.S. government, would select Carly Fiorina as his VP, best known for almos=
t shutting down a great U.S. company.

*         As CEO of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina:

o   Cut HP's stock value in half

o   Laid off 30,000 workers<<<link>>
y-fiorinas-record-not-so-sterling.html?smid=3Dtw-nytimes&smtyp=3Dcur&_r=3D2=

o   Outsourced American jobs<<<link>>

o   Sold computer equipment to Iran<<<link>>

o   Received a $40 million golden parachute<<<link>>

 fired

o   Earned status<<<link>>
CEOs-of-All-Time.html?page=3D3> as one of the "Worst American CEOs of all T=
ime"

*         Don't be fooled: Cruz and Fiorina are not "outsiders." Cruz has b=
een in politics for decades and has collected a government paycheck since 1=
999, and Fiorina is only an "outsider" because California voters overwhelmi=
ngly rejected her candidacy, even in a banner year for Republicans.

Here's what some others have had to say about Fiorina's disastrous tenure a=
t HP:

"A consummate self-promoter, Fiorina was busy pontificating on the lecture =
domain.com and posing for magazine covers while her company floundered. She pa=
id herself handsome bonuses and perks while laying off thousands of employe=
es to cut costs. The merger Fiorina orchestrated with Compaq in 2015 was wi=
dely seen as a failure. She was ousted in 2005." -CNBC Portfolio's list of =
worst CEOs of all time<<<link>>

"The stock price dropped by 50% only to rally 10% on the announcement of he=
r firing. She fired 28,000 people before she herself was fired, departing w=
ith the 21 million dollar golden parachute that is financing her campaign."=

"Call her the anti-Steve Jobs. During her 1999-2005 tenure as CEO of Hewlet=
