Couple things here:

Attached the doc I put together a while back when Trump was supposedly releasing his list of potential nominees.

Here's the article where Grassley said he believes Trump would nominate the right type of justice based on the fact Trump previously mentioned Bill Pryor as a potential nominee.

Des Moines Register: Grassley: Trump Would Nominate 'Right Type' To Court<<<link>>>

Last week, Grassley said it would be a 'gamble' to let Trump fill the vacancy:

Huffington Post: Chuck Grassley Admits It's 'A Gamble' To Let Trump Fill SCOTUS Vacancy<<<link>>>

Bill Pryor's Greatest Hits:

*         Called Roe v. Wade "the worst abomination in the history of constitutional law."

*         Opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest.

*         Urged Congress to repeal Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

*         Was the only Attorney General in the nation to file an amicus brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the federal remedy for victims of sexual assault in the Violence Against Women Act was unconstitutional.

*         In 2005, Lambda Legal called Pryor "the most demonstrably antigay judicial nominee in recent memory."

And here is a release Rachel and I put together about all of Trump's potential nominees to prepare for him possibly releasing a list. He should definitely be pressed to release it now - all of these judges fall right into our narrative over the past few weeks (terrible for women, for voting rights, for the LGBT community). It never went back around RR2 so here it is:

SL: Whom Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley Are Holding Out For

Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley have long been waiting for this day - to see whom their party's frontrunner would consider nominating to the Supreme Court. The day has finally come, and it's nothing pretty.

"The Supreme Court nominating process is serious, Donald Trump is not. Again and again he has demonstrated he lacks the experience and temperament to be an effective commander-in-chief. So it comes as no surprise that his list of top picks for the Supreme Court is full of red flags.

"The justices judges he wants to elevate to our highest court have a history of making the same sort of unpredictable, extreme decisions that we see every day from Trump. It's bad enough that Senate Republicans refuse to uphold the Constitution, do their jobs and hold hearings on President Obama's eminently qualified nominee. But, it's worse that the reason for the obstruction is their hope that Trump would get to nominate one of these judges.," - OrganizationPress Secretary Mark Paustenbach

No one is more qualified to immediately serve on the Supreme Court than Chief Judge Merrick Garland - but Senate Republicans continue to say they won't meet with Chief Judge Garland, hold a hearing or vote on his nomination.
