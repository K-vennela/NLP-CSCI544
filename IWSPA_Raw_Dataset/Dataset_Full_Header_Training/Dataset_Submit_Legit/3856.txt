Constitutional Responsibility Project Releases First TV Ad, New Pennsylvani=
a Poll, and Announces Major Recess Activities

Sen. Toomey's Refusal to Do His Job Puts Large Block of Swing Voters in Pla=
y, New Pennsylvania Ad Buy Puts Spotlight on Sen. Toomey's Obstruction and =
CRP Launches Supreme Court Obstruction Tour

Washington, DC - Today, the Constitutional Responsibility Project released =
its first television ad. The 30-second spot<<<link>>> s=
howcases Sen. Pat Toomey's (R-PA) unprecedented refusal to consider any Sup=
reme Court nominee and calls on Sen. Toomey to put the Constitution before =
his politics. The ad will air in the Philadelphia media market over the Sen=
ate recess.

In addition, the Constitutional Responsibility Project, in conjunction with=
 the League of Conservation Voters, released a new survey of Pennsylvania v=
oters conducted by Hart Research. The survey found that Pennsylvania voters=
 are paying close attention to the news about the Supreme Court vacancy, su=
pport giving Judge Garland a hearing and an up-or-down vote, and strongly d=
isapprove of the positon Senate Republican leadership has taken on this mat=
ter. In addition, support grows for confirming Judge Garland once voters le=
arn more about his background. Finally, while voters were largely unaware o=
f Sen. Pat Toomey's decision to follow GOP leadership in opposing a hearing=
 for Merrick Garland, when they learned of his inaction voters were substan=
tially less likely to vote for Toomey.

A full memo from Hart Research Associates outlining the survey's findings a=
nd polling method can be found HERE<<<link>>
s/2016/04/WN9-PA.pdf>.

Key findings from the Constitutional Responsibility Project and the League =
of Conservation Voters survey include:

  *   By a margin of 56 percent to 37 percent, Pennsylvania voters say the =
Senate should hold hearings and give Chief Judge Garland an up-or-down-vote=
.
     *   Independent voters agree with this position by an event larger mar=
gin - 60 percent to 36 percent.
  *   After voters hear the pros and cons on Senator Toomey's positon on th=
e Supreme Court vacancy, feelings toward him become notably less favorable.
     *   Independents move from a small net positive view of Toomey (24 per=
cent positive, 18 percent negative) to a large net negative opinion of him =
(24 percent positive, 50 percent negative).
  *   At the start of the survey, 43 percent of voters said they were incli=
ned to vote for Senator Toomey over his Democratic challenger. After being =
told about his stance on Judge Garland's nomination, 46 percent of voters s=
aid they are less likely to support Senator Toomey.
  *   16 percent of voters said they would be more open to voting for the D=
emocratic challenger as a result of Senator Toomey's opposition to hearings=
 and a vote for Judge Garland.

"The results of this survey show that Sen. Pat Toomey is badly out of step =
with his state on the question of whether the Senate should consider the Su=
preme Court nomination of Merrick Garland," said Geoff Garin, President of =
Hart Research Associates. "He is particularly at odds with Pennsylvania's i=
ndependent voters, who are likely to hold the balance of power in this Nove=
mber's elections. If Sen. Toomey continues his partisan stance, it is likel=
y to swing many voters to his Democratic challenger and endanger his re-ele=
ction chances."

"This poll shows that Pennsylvanians strongly believe that Senator Toomey a=
nd others must give the president's nominee both a fair hearing and a timel=
y vote, and LCV members couldn't agree more.  Nearly 150,000 of them have s=
igned a petition calling on the Senate to do its job, including nearly 5,00=
0 in Pennsylvania alone," said Tiernan Sittenfeld, Senior Vice President of=
 Government Affairs, League of Conservation Voters. "There is clearly a wel=
l-funded and radical opposition hell-bent on ensuring that Senator Toomey a=
nd other obstructionists stay the course, but we will continue to engage in=
 this Supreme Court vacancy fight in a far bigger way than ever before beca=
use the stakes have never been higher for climate change and so many other =
critically important issues."

"Despite widespread disapproval from his constituents, Sen. Toomey is still=
 willing to follow Mitch McConnell's lead and deny Chief Judge Garland - an=
 exceptionally qualified nominee by any standard - the fair hearing and up-=
or-down vote he deserves. Our new ad will help remind voters that Senator T=
oomey is playing politics with Constitution instead of doing his job," said=
 Stephanie Cutter of the Constitutional Responsibility Project. "This ad is=
 just one of element our recess campaign, which will include more than 50 e=
vents in Pennsylvania and eight other states."

As the Senate enters a weeklong recess, the Constitutional Responsibility P=
roject, in coordination with Americans United for Change and other coalitio=
n partners, will launch a mobile billboard campaign across nine states over=
 nine days to showcase the need for nine Supreme Court justices. From April=
 30 to May 8, the campaign will hold over 50 events taking place in Arizona=
, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvan=
ia, and Wisconsin, and will rally voters who are tired of their Senator's r=
efusal to live up to their constitutional responsibilities and give Chief J=
udge Garland a fair hearing and up-or-down vote.
