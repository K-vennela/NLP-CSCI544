No worries. I was replying the first email but both you have anticipated me a couple of times and I had to change my reply, accordingly.

Hi Emad,

I suggest to keep separate the reply about the report and the business situation with the partner.
Like I wrote yesterday to Daniel, you can use the standard reply prepared by Eric (here below) and conclude with your few words like I wrote at the end of this email.
No more written comments.
If he needs specific information we can to arrange a conf call and be more detailed by voice.

Marco

As a matter of company policy, we do not disclose either the identities or the location of clients because they rely on confidentiality
 in conducting their investigations.   However, here is a statement from Hacking Team regarding the recent Citizen’s Lab report.  

Statement on Citizen’s Lab/Kaspersky report of June 24, 2014:

Hacking Team is aware of the ongoing efforts of Citizen’s Lab to attack our business by attempting to disclose confidential
 information, systems, and procedures that we use.  This report is only their latest effort.  It is evident that the primary complaint of the authors is about repressive government, however, Citizen’s Lab has chosen to target a private business operating in
 full compliance with all relevant law.

We believe the software we provide is essential for law enforcement and for the safety of us all in an age when terrorists,
 drug dealers, sex traffickers and other criminals routinely use the domain.com and mobile communications to carry out their crimes.  We sell only to government agencies such as police forces.  We do not conduct digital investigations.  Those are carried out
 by law enforcement and are, of course, entirely confidential as is any law enforcement investigation.  

The June 24 report does not include our customer policy, however, we invite you to read the policy which describes the steps
 we take to avoid abuse of our software.  We believe this policy is unique in our industry and a strong, good-faith effort to prevent misuse of our products.  We have both refused to do business with agencies we felt might misuse our software, and we have investigated
 cases either discovered internally or reported in the press that suggest abuse.  We can and have taken action in such cases, however, we consider the results of our investigations and the actions we take based on them to be confidential matters between us
 and our clients.

# # # 

For the same reason that we do not disclose customer identities, we do not confirm or describe any investigation we might undertake
 on the basis of questions being raised about possible use of our software.   I understand this does not answer your questions, but I hope you will accept our position that HT operates with a high ethical standard and that we take our customer policy very seriously.

We want to reassure you and the client that:
- HT is fully committed in confidentiality, we will never confirm or deny the identity of our clients.
- the report contains information that is related to old events or was already public, there
 is no evidence that recent versions of RCS are affected in any way.

No no, no apologies please, working at weekends is very highly appreciated! So, dear Emad, a big thank you for your engagement today and in the future!

In fact, we have not created any official answer / internal policy for this kind of clients’ inquiries. 

I exhort  Marco to take a position on this taking into account the thread which occurred a couple of days ago.

Thanks,
David
