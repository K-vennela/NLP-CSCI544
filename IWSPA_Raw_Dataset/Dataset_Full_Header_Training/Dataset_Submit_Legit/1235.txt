Good Afternoon,
Is a Representative from the Organizationavailable to be on the News with Ed Schultz on RT America Tuesday evening to discuss the Democratic primary and moving the campaign toward focusing on Trump?

We would be looking to do this between 8 - 8:30 PM ET if possible.

We have studios in Washington DC, New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, but could arrange a studio elsewhere if necessary.

I hope we can work this out.

Thanks,

Brent Jabbour
Booker
