Prepared Remarks for Delivery: OrganizationChair Rep. Wasserman Schultz at Alaska State Convention

ANCHORAGE -- Tonight, OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz addressed the Alaska State Convention. Below you will find excerpts as prepared for delivery:

"As chair of the DNC, I've committed myself to getting to know my fellow Democrats with visits to all fifty states - and I'll be honest, it's been a little easier to reach those lower forty-eight.

...

"But I know I'm not the only one here tonight who travelled a great distance to be at the convention - I understand there are even as many as 40 high school students coming all the way from Juneau, and who registered to be delegates - let's give them a hand for being the future of our party.
"And let me just thank everyone else here who has travelled from across our country's largest state to show your support.
"Your enthusiasm, energy, your commitment, and your dedication to our party will make all the difference on Election Day.

...

"Here in Alaska the Organizationhelps fund direct mail campaigns to reach voters and help get them to the polls on Election Day.
"We fund salaries for critical staff under our state party partnerships. In fact, Kay Brown can tell you, she was one of the first State Party Partnership employees we ever hired.

"Since 2009, the Organizationhas directly provided the Alaska Democratic Party more than $625,000 in direct support.
"But it's not just the funding -- the Organizationhas been out-pacing the GOP in how we offer direct support to our state parties with training, and bench-building; we share our deep research and communications capabilities in Alaska and across the country.

...

"But of course, our number one advantage comes from our candidates, and the contrast they're offering Alaska voters and the American people.
"I couldn't be more proud of the two candidates at the top of our ticket.

"From Day One, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have been running smart, substantive campaigns focused on the issues that matter.

"We've watched them engage honestly with voters, answer thoughtfully at town halls and debates, and deliver an aspirational message that speaks to the hopes and dreams of the American people...

"And no matter which one of our candidates becomes the nominee, we will be united coming out of our convention and headed toward Election Day.

"In the words of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders 'Trump will not be president.'

...

"I'm inspired here tonight - I wish everyone could see how much dedication the Democrats of Alaska have.
"Don't believe for a second that just because the pundits like to paint Alaska red and say it isn't a battleground state means you're sidelined.

"In every presidential election since 2000, the percentage of Alaskans casting their vote for the Democrat has increased - from 27% in 2015 to more than 40% in 2012.
"This has already been an exciting election year nationally - working together, I know we can Dump Trump and, eventually turn Alaska Blue.
"I know we can count on you to keep working hard throughout this election.
"So thank you for all you've done to support our party, and thank you for everything you will do to bring us all the way to victory in November.
"Now on to victory! Thank you, Alaska Democrats!"
