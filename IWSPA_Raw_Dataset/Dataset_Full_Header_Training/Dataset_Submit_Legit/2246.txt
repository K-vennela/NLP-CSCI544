CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 2 earned an estimated $3.5 million overseas bringing its total to $145.8 million.




We had two new openings this week.  France debuted with $1.6 (50% bigger than the launch of CLOUDY 1) with several weeks of rolling school vacations ahead of us.  The Netherlands bowed to $.825 including previews.  Excluding previews, the opening is about even with CLOUDY 1 which had the domain.com of launching at the start of school vacations.  This year's school holidays begin next week.



Among our holdovers, Spain's cume now stands at $6.7, Turkey at $1.7 and Norway is $1.4
