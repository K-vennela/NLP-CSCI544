One tweak, framing in last sentence, so that we don't dismiss Trump outright but rather raise the GOP's divisive politics. And instead of "getting" 20 million people health care, "making" it "accessible."

Eric drafted this last night

SL: Is Thin-Skinned Trump's Prez Run an Attempt at Payback for 2015 White House Correspondents' Dinner?

Body: From the New York Times<<<link>>>:

That evening of public abasement, rather than sending Mr. Trump away, accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world. And it captured the degree to which Mr. Trump's campaign is driven by a deep yearning sometimes obscured by his bluster and bragging: a desire to be taken seriously.

So in addition to rescuing the U.S. economy, rescuing and the auto industry, creating over 14 million new jobs, getting unemployment to under 5%, getting making providing health coverage accessible to 20 million previously uninsured Americans while slowing the growth of health costs, killing Osama Bin Laden and taking out key ISIS leaders, 30,000 other terrorists, President Obama may have led the Republican Party to having to own the results of years of their ugly and divisive politics. a Democratic successor And he did it using nothing but his comedic chops.

Thanks, Obama!
