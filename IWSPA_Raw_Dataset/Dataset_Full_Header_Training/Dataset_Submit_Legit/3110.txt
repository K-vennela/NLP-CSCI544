Post-Indiana Primary Talking Points
May 3, 2015 

Topline Message:

=B7         The results of the primaries in Indiana are the culmination of =
a disastrous week for the Republican Party.

=B7         With Ted Cruz=92s capitulation, the GOP=92s problems now extend=
 far beyond their convention.

=B7         Donald Trump simply doesn=92t have the judgment or temperament =
to be President, and the American people know it.

=B7         In Indiana, like in other primaries over the past few weeks, th=
e vast majority of Democratic primary voters said our primary had energized=
 them, and majorities would support either one of our strong candidates. A =
majority of Republicans, on the other hand, conceded that their primary has=
 been divisive and 53% said they feel betrayed by the Republican Party.

=B7         The next President of the United States will be nominated at ou=
r Democratic convention in Philadelphia.

Republicans Had Their Worst Week Ever

=B7         In just seven days, Republicans saw their former House Speaker =
call one of their candidates =91Lucifer in the flesh,=92 watched a desperat=
e, mathematically-eliminated campaign announce a Vice Presidential pick and=
 get ridiculed for it, and then kicked off the Indiana primaries with accus=
ations that Ted Cruz=92s father was tied to Lee Harvey Oswald. That last al=
legation was made by Dangerous Donald Trump based on a tabloid story he saw=
 in the National Enquirer.

=B7         Now the GOP is stuck with the tabloid-touting reality TV star a=
s their presumptive nominee, a divisive candidate whose ugly campaign rheto=
ric is tied to dangerous proposals that would drag America backwards and ma=
ke our country less safe.

=B7         More than 7 out of 10 Democrats are energized by our primary. L=
ast week, in Connecticut and Pennsylvania respectively, 67% and 71% of Demo=
crats reported feeling energized by our primary. Today in Indiana it was th=
ree-quarters of Democratic voters who said our primary has energized our pa=
rty, and a majority of Democrats who voted today expressed support for eith=
er one of our candidates.

=B7         In Indiana, domain.com polls showed that 53 percent of Republican pri=
mary voters say they feel betrayed by the Republican Party. A majority of R=
epublicans concede that their primary has been divisive, and easily a third=
 of Republicans would prefer to stay home or support an alternative candida=
te than vote for Trump in November.

=B7         And the Republican Party is less popular than it=92s been in mo=
re than two decades.

A Crisis of Their Own Making

=B7         For years, GOP leaders have pushed a cynical and feckless domain.com=
ical strategy that exploits unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the =
poor, the LGBT community and more, all for political gain.

=B7         They have sold hardworking Americans the empty promise of trick=
le-down prosperity, while strangling America=92s middle class with backward=
s economic policies that only enrich those already at the top.

=B7         Donald Trump=92s impending nomination after Tuesday=92s results=
 is the ultimate, sad culmination of the success of that strategy. Trump is=
 the modern Republican Party.

=B7         While the Republican establishment comes to terms with their no=
minee, even some of them are acknowledging Trump is dangerous and lacks the=
 judgment to be Commander in Chief.

o   Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on Sunday said that he=92s tro=
ubled by the fact that Donald Trump doesn=92t listen to anyone, and raised =
serious questions about Trump on foreign policy. Between his contradictions=
 and threatening our most important alliances, Donald Trump would put our c=
ountry on a dangerous path.

Democrats United

=B7         Democrats will emerge united from our primary and our conventio=
n.

=B7         Both Senator Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders have been cl=
ear they=92ll work hard in November to ensure we don=92t let a Republican l=
ike Trump drag our country backward.

We=92ve cautioned our candidates to maintain a tone that helps us build tow=
ard the general election, recognizing that as we funnel down the home stret=
ch of any campaign the intensity level will rise.

=95         Ultimately, Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders are drawing s=
harp differences with one another, but their differences remain focused on =
how to best move America forward.

=B7         Because the Party=92s platform is a statement of our values, th=
e Organizationis committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both o=
f our campaigns will be represented on the Platform Drafting Committee, and=
 just as we did in 2015 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to par=
ticipate.

=B7         Democrats know that we=92re stronger when more voices are heard=
, and when we stand together to move our country forward, we=92ll see that =
in Philadelphia at our convention.

saying he would allow states to restrict women=92s rights, to saying aborti=
on laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial appointments.

The GOP=92s Problem with Women Voters

=B7         All of the Republican candidates have made it clear that the GO=
P doesn=92t stand with women.

=B7         Donald Trump is viewed unfavorably by 7 out of 10 women after a=
n ugly primary in which he has regularly made offensive comments and shown =
a deep disrespect for women.

=B7         John Kasich said that he wants to see Roe v. Wade repealed<http=

punishment that would lead to, he evaded the question by saying that it sho=

=B7         Ted Cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped, she=
 should be forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to term.

=B7         In the past, the Republican candidates have opposed ensuring eq=
ual pay, family leave, and voted against the Violence Against Women Act.

=B7         Last month we marked Equal Pay Day, the day in 2015 when women=
=92s earnings have caught up with men=92s earnings from 2015. On average we=
 women earn 79 cents to their dollar, and it=92s worse for women of color. =
All of the Republican presidential candidates would stand against protectio=
ns that ensure greater equality in the workplace.

=B7         John Kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we d=
on=92t need workplace protections, just a =91change of heart=92 among major=
 employers.

=B7         Ted Cruz voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act three times an=
d ridiculed the legislation as a =91show vote.=92

=B7         Donald Trump stated that women would have pay equity if they di=
d =91as good a job=92 as men.

Advantage, Democrats

=B7         Democrats are winning where it matters.

=B7         Senator Clinton has earned more votes, well over XX 12 million =
=96 and far ahead of Donald Trump =96 while Senator Sanders has  earned mor=
e than XX 9 million votes (well ahead of Ted Cruz and John Kasich), while a=
lso garnering more than seven million individual campaign contributions fro=
m low dollar donors.

=B7         If there is an enthusiasm gap, it clearly favors Democrats.
