DONALD TRUMP
TRUMP SUGGESTS RAFAEL CRUZ HELPED ASSASSINATE JFK: “Donald Trump on Tuesday alleged that Ted Cruz’s father was with John F. Kennedy’s assassin shortly before he murdered the president, parroting a National Enquirer story claiming that Rafael Cruz was pictured with Lee Harvey Oswald handing out pro-Fidel Castro pamphlets in New Orleans in 1963…‘His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being - you know, shot. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous,’ Trump said Tuesday during a phone interview with Fox News. ‘What is this, right prior to his being shot, and nobody even brings it up. They don't even talk about that. That was reported, and nobody talks about it.’ ‘I mean, what was he doing - what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death? Before the shooting?’ Trump continued. ‘It’s horrible.’” [Politico, 5/3/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP RESPONDS TO “MOST RECENT OUTBURST FROM TED CRUZ”: “Ted Cruz is a desperate candidate trying to save his failing campaign. It is no surprise he has resorted to his usual tactics of over-the-top rhetoric that nobody believes. Over the last week, I have watched Lyin’ Ted become more and more unhinged as he is unable to react under the pressure and stress of losing, in all cases by landslides, the last six primary elections --- in fact, coming in last place in all but one of them. Today’s ridiculous outburst only proves what I have been saying for a long time, that Ted Cruz does not have the temperament to be President of the United States.” [Donald J. Trump for President, Statement, 5/3/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP SAYS HE WOULD “PROHIBIT” MILITARY LEADERS FROM TALKING TO PRESS: “If he becomes commander in chief, Donald Trump won’t let military generals speak to “the dishonest press,” out of fear they’ll spill national security secrets. ‘A general should not be on television,’ the Republican front-runner told a crowd of supporters during a rally at Carmel, Indiana, on Monday. ‘I don't want our generals on television. I will domain.com them.’” [Military Times, 5/3/16<<<link>>>]
EXPERTS WARN OF BACKLASH OVER TRUMP’S CHINA TRADE POLICIES: “Starting a trade war might be cathartic for workers who have lost jobs, but it is unlikely to create a lot of factory work. ‘There’s no way a tariff of this kind could deliver the kind of benefits that he’s talking about, and it’s quite wrong to think that the big problem for American workers has been foreign trade,’ said J .W. Mason, a professor of economics at John Jay College and a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank. ‘But I think it could be very destructive for the rest of the world.’” [New York Times, 5/3/16<<<link>>://domain.com/>]
TRUMP FALSELY SAYS HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT MIKE TYSON’S RAPE TRIAL: “‘Do you still think Mike Tyson got a raw deal when he endorsed you?’ Trump was asked. ‘I don’t know anything about it. I know he endorsed me. I heard he endorsed me,’ Trump stated. ‘I don’t know anything about his trial. I really don’t.’ Trump, a longtime friend of Tyson, opined at length about the trial on television, in newspapers, and in magazines. Trump has claimed Tyson was ‘railroaded’ in the case and on several occasions offered criticism of Tyson’s defense attorney. Trump said in 1992 that Tyson could pay the victim with money from a fight to avoid serving time in prison. Trump also called into question whether the victim had been raped at all.” [Buzzfeed, 5/2/16<<<link>>#.yrDpoekV8>]
TRUMP NOW PAYS TWITTER TO PROMOTE HIS TWEETS: “Mr. Trump’s campaign has joined Twitter’s regional ad targeting, having four of his posts appear in the feeds of selected Twitter users in Indiana, regardless of whether they are followers of the candidate. In a sign of growing technical sophistication within the Trump campaign, the Twitter posts are being aimed at particular audiences within the state. For example, a post with a video featuring the endorsement of Bobby Knight, theformer Indiana University basketball coach, was targeted at basketball fans as identified by Twitter.” [New York Times, 5/3/16<<<link>>>]

TED CRUZ
CRUZ AIDE SAYS CAMPAIGN IS BRACING FOR IMMEDIATE STAFF CUTS AND “A VERY SOMBER” SPEECH TUESDAY NIGHT: “Cruz has spent the past week camped out in Indiana, securing the support of the state's governor and announcing retired technology executive Carly Fiorina as his running mate. Yet his aides were pessimistic heading into Tuesday's voting and were prepared for Cruz to fall short. With polls predicting a loss, campaign officials were bracing for immediate staffing cuts ‘at a minimum,’ according to one aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal discussions. The aide said the campaign was preparing for ‘a very somber’ address Tuesday night in Indianapolis.” [AP, 5/3/16<<<link>>>]
CRUZ MOCKS TRUMP’S “BATTLES WITH VENEREAL DISEASE”: “Cruz continued: ‘The man cannot tell the truth, but he combines with it being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don't think this country has ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and goes, “Dude, what's your problem?”’…‘Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it,’ Cruz told reporters, referring to remarks Trump made to radio personality Howard Stern in 1997. ‘This is not a secret. He's proud of being a serial philanderer. I want everyone to think about your teenage kids. The president of the United States talks about how great it is to domain.com adultery, how proud he is, describes his battles with venereal disease as his own personal Vietnam.’” [Texas Tribune, 5/3/16<<<link>>>]
