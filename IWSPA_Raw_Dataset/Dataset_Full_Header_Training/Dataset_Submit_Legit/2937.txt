domain.com that you're surprised with how this played out
-        I'm happy with how it played out

How do you turn around and unite the party?
-        I've gotten lots of calls from people more brutal than Ted was who want to join the team.
-        They're politicians. It was just talk.

Do you care if Ted endorsed you?
-        it would be nice.
-        There are some Republicans whose endorsement I don't really want
-        Don't need them
-        I'll do great on economy and military

George Will: Conservative Duty to make you lose all 50 states
-        he's a loser. A tower guy. I don't want his support
-        says he didn't want to go to Will's speech at Mar-a-Lago because Will is boring and I didn't know I was going to go into politics.
-        He holds a grudge
-        He has no influence.
-        All his columns are bad
-        All Krauthamer does is bash me.
-        I'll have the slowest trigger on nuclear. But I'll prepare it.

Dem candidate will support intervention more than GOP nominee.
-        Krauthammer was pushing for the war in Iraq and as a civilian I was totally against it.
-        We need a strong temperament. The world is laughing at us.

Clip of HRC saying Trump has given no indication that Trump understands gravity of being Commander in Chief.
-        It's just words. Just another politician talking.
-        Sanders said she has poor judgment.
-        He also says she was unqualified, but I won't go there.
-        Re: emails, she should suffer like others who have done far less
-        Shouldn't even be allowed to run

You've said things that people think you will change in General. Muslim ban?
-        We have to be vigilant. Have to be very careful. Obama doesn't say the term.

So that policy is still on the table?
-        Well, I don't know if it hurts me.
-        I've been guided by common sense, and what's right.
-        We have to be careful.
-        We have to figure out what the hell is going on
-        Thousands and thousands of people are "being placed" around the country with no documentation.
-        In Europe, they're destroying countries with the migrations.

Punishment for abortions?
-        he was asking a rhetorical standpoint and I gave an answer.
-        Says his answer was a great "academic answer"
-        Says nobody thinks he supports punishing women

Wallace: You will need to turn democrats to you. How will you turn around your negatives with married women?
-        We have tremendous numbers of democrats.
-        Says lots of democrats in NY wanted to vote for Trump but weren't allowed
-        Women want security
-        Our military has been decimated
-        Gen. Orierno (sp) says military is unprepared

But women want someone steady. You shoot from the hip.
-        I don't shoot from the hip.
-        In recent states, I won with women in every state by massive majorities.
-         "I'm doing really well with the men."
-        HRC doesn't know anything about jobs. Her husband passed NAFTA

Joe: you will have more populist Republican and more interventionist Democrat in this general.

Heilman: you're heading into a $1 billion general election. Will you accept super PAC support
-        I'm going to be making a decision over the next week.
-        We will need money for the party
-        I don't even want some Republicans' support
-        It will be HRC, because system is rigged against Bernie
-        I'll have to decide if I want to sell a few buildings, not sure I want to do that.
-        Don't want money for myself. Want it for the party.

VP selection?
-        Says the names being floated are generally right
-        "More than likely, I'll go the political route"
o   want someone who can help get legislation passed so he won't have to use EOs like Obama

Not a General?
-        One of my strengths will be the military
