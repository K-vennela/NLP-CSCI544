Jenna and I were on three pitch calls with Pablo yesterday, of which two sh=
ows would work well for our team.

The third show is hosted by Armstrong Williams. He's rather conservative an=
d I am not sure what the upside would be. Need more information on his audi=
ence.

Maggie Linton is a Democrat who is quietly looking to use her show as a pla=
tform to stop Trump.

I have done a number of interviews with Pratt, and he's done quite well as =
of late. We had a lengthy discussion after one of his not-so-good interview=
s, and he's taken coaching well.

If he doesn't do it then either User or I should do it because this would b=
e a good opportunity. We can't punt for fear of messing up.
