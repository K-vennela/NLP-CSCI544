Assume Trump will also be meeting with other Members of Congress.

We should tee something up now; please reply with suggestions.

May be another chance to highlight Senators who want Trump to pick the next=
 SCOTUS nominee.

Unsure if this went around

RNC head says Trump, Ryan to meet next week<<<link>>
/2016/05/06/rnc-head-says-trump-ryan-to-meet-next-week.html>

Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus said Thursday that presu=
mptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan wo=
uld meet next week in an effort to clear the air after Ryan said he was "ju=
st not ready" to back Trump in the general election this fall.

"I think it's going to work out," Priebus told Fox News' Sean Hannity. "In =
some cases people are not going to be instantly on board, and I now that ca=
n be frustrating for some people. But i think everyone has to ... allow a l=
ittle bit of the steam to get out and get everybody settled down. And I thi=
nk this is going to come together."

Priebus spoke hours after Ryan confirmed CNN that he was "just not ready" t=
o support or endorse Trump. The Wisconsin Republican suggested that he want=
s the real estate mogul to do more to unify the party first, but added that=
 he hoped to support Trump.

Trump fired back in a statement, saying, "I am not ready to support Speaker=
 Ryan's agenda."

"Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about =
what is best for the American people," the statement continued. "They have =
been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to =
put them first!"

Preibus told Hannity he had spoken to both Trump and Ryan Thursday and said=
 both men were "committed to sitting down and actually talking this out."

Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton=92s campaign also has been eager to=
 point out any rifts in the party, and quickly blasted out a message claimi=
ng Ryan had joined the =93growing list of conservatives rebuking Trump."

Also Thursday, the Associated Press reported that Illinois Gov. Bruce Raune=
r will not endorse Trump in the general election and will not attend the co=
nvention. Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., who is expected to face a tough re-electi=
on fight against Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, has said he is also skipp=
ing the convention.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican chief executive in a traditionally =
Democratic state, declined again Thursday to endorse a GOP candidate, despi=
te the departures this week of Ted Cruz and John Kasich that left Trump the=
 last man standing.

"I said I was not going to get involved, and I would not endorse any candid=
ate and that I was going to stay focused on Maryland," Hogan told reporters=
, according to The Washington Post. "And I=92m not going to take any more s=
tupid questions about Donald Trump."

By contrast, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who endorsed Cruz ahead of this week'=
s primary, has said he will back Trump, telling TV station WTHI "I look for=
ward to supporting our presumptive nominee. I think Donald Trump will do ve=
ry well in the Hoosier State."

Fox News confirmed Thursday that 2015 Republican presidential nominee Mitt =
Romney =96 a vocal Trump critic -- has no plans to attend the convention, w=
hile former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush both have confir=
med they will not attend either. A source close to former Senator and 1996 =
Republican nominee Bob Dole said he would =93briefly=94 attend the conventi=
on but primarily to attend a lunch hosted by his law firm.

"This was a very contentious primary," Priebus said. "I think it's going to=
 take a little bit of time, but I think for the most part this is going to =
come together. Maybe not 100 percent, but i think we're going to get very c=
lose to that and i think people will fall in line."
