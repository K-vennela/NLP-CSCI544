Here's what we're looking at:

-If the hit is from 4-4:10, User can do it at the CNN studio and call into his 4:15 California press call. He must dial in by 4:15.
-If the hit is from 4-30-5, User can do it from the Organizationstudio but would miss the last 15 minutes of the press call. The OrganizationStudio is only open from 4:15-5.

Adding Walter on here for his awareness since it's his call.
