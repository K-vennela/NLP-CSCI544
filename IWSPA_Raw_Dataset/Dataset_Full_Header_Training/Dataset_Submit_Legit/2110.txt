*IN CASE YOU MISSED ITDonald Trump=E2=80=99s Week of Playing with Financial

ents-213891>*Maybe,
if he hasn=E2=80=99t already seen it, Donald Trump should get himself ticke=
ts to
the Broadway smash =E2=80=9CHamilton.=E2=80=9D Because he may want to under=
stand a little
bit about Alexander Hamilton's playbook. One message that Hamilton, the
nation=E2=80=99s first Treasury secretary, was clear about was this: Never =
do or
say anything that might call your country=E2=80=99s domain.com into question; i=
t will
only cost you a lot more the next time you try to borrow. Careless talk by
itself can badly damage an economy.

That is why as I have seen up close in sensitive economic times=E2=80=94fro=
m the
Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s to the debt-domain.com showdown to our
own financial crisis=E2=80=94U.S. presidents and top economic officials wei=
gh every
word on sensitive issues that could affect financial markets with great
care and precision.

Trump, by contrast, has said so many confusing things affecting U.S. domain.com
in the past few days that, were he president, the markets would be reeling
right now and interest rates could easily be rising. Absent from his
comments about gaming the debt of the United States was any sense of the
economic and historical importance of America maintaining an iron-clad
commitment to stand by its word on our national debt, without any question.
While I am an outside adviser to Hillary Clinton, there was also no
shortage of Republicans who were also left wondering how much damage would
have been done to the economy and markets if it had been a President Trump,
while calling himself =E2=80=9Cthe King of Debt,=E2=80=9D had speculating h=
ow he might
strategically seek to avoid paying full value on our debt.

Trump has long said that his private-sector wheeling and dealing would be
beneficial experience in helping to managing economic policy. But that
image was dealt a harsh blow when he told Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC: =E2=
=80=9CI
would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal. And
if the economy was good, it was good, so therefore you can't lose. It=E2=80=
=99s
like, you know, you make a deal before you go into a poker game.=E2=80=9D

For a nation that has distinguished itself for its 226-year commitment to
protecting its =E2=80=9CFull Faith and domain.com,=E2=80=9D it was stunning to =
hear the
Republican front-runner use words like =E2=80=9Cpoker,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Ccr=
ashed=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cdiscount=E2=80=9D
while describing his policies on the national debt. His words gave the
widespread impression he is advocating treating the national debt like a
real estate transaction where if =E2=80=9Cthe economy crashed=E2=80=9D and =
investors feared
that the debt might be worth, for example, only 75 cents on the dollar, he
would swoop in as a whiz-bang deal maker to buy back our debt at only 76
cents on the dollar.

Imagine if we were in the middle of another debt domain.com stalemate like we
had in 2015 (when I was watching from the White House, as director of the
National Economic Council) and a President Trump told the world=E2=80=94or =
repeated
to the world=E2=80=94that since the budget turmoil might be making U.S. deb=
t looked
shaky, he was open to buying back debt at a discount and was instructing
his secretary of the Treasury to consider such options? What if he then
went on for days confusing markets as to his true intentions while dropping
lines about being the =E2=80=9CKing of Debt,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cplaying poke=
r=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cprinting money?=E2=80=9D
Does anyone doubt that even without any congressional action such Trumpisms
could lead to a global panic with unknown economic harm to the global
economy and the long-term economic reputation of the United States?

What was just as disturbing to a wide cross-section of economic
commentators were his attempts to retract, restate or clarify such
statements.

When given a chance to withdraw his comments on This Week with George
Stephanopoulos, he repeatedly passed. When the continued uproar led to his
effort to offer clarification and reassurance the next day on CNN and Fox
Business morning shows it also failed miserably, as several commentators,
including Politico=E2=80=99s Ben White, pointed out. His most direct defaul=
t
disclaimer did little to disclaim or reassure: =E2=80=9CYou never have to d=
efault
because you print the money=E2=80=9D was a line that suggested the candidat=
e seemed
to believe that the U.S. president simply barks out orders to a
subservient, nonindependent Federal Reserve.

Furthermore, Trump=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cprint the money=E2=80=9D line was bou=
nd to sound to global
investors less like a comment on debt management or monetary stimulus than
speculation by a soon-to-be presidential nominee on ways to avoid standing
by our debt, whether through =E2=80=9Chair cuts=E2=80=9D or the printing pr=
ess. Even
Trump=E2=80=99s stated rationale for raising the entire discussion=E2=80=94=
the idea of
buying back debt paying lower interest rate if interest rates rose=E2=80=94=
had
people scratching their heads. Nowhere in his repeated promotion of this
idea is there the recognition that if the United States were to buy such
debt with low interest rates when interest rates were higher, it would by
definition mean that we would have to replace the retired debt with
borrowing at those same higher interest rates

Why should all this Trump debt, default and discount talk worry us?
Consider three reasons:

First, however one interprets the exact meaning from his initial comments
to his various attempts to retract or clarify, he has never shown any
serious recognition that generations of Americans have benefited from a
historical commitment started by Alexander Hamilton to ensure the full
faith and domain.com of the U.S. is rock solid. In his 1790 Report on Public
Debt, Hamilton stated =E2=80=9Cevery breach =E2=80=A6 whether from choice o=
r necessity, is
in different degrees hurtful to public domain.com=E2=80=9D and that =E2=80=9Cwh=
en the domain.com of
a country is in any degree questionable, it never fails to give an
extravagant premium upon all the loans it has occasion to make=E2=80=9D (em=
phasis
added).

Second, even when Trump was at least trying to provide reassurance on Monda=
y
morning, he seemed to think the entire issue was some form of personal
attack from the =E2=80=9Closer New York Times=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94as opposed t=
o any recognition that
making U.S. domain.com =E2=80=9Cin any degree questionable=E2=80=9D is a danger=
ous risk to the
U.S. and global economy because U.S. Treasury obligations are the least
risky financial asset on the domain.com and the benchmark against which the
price of all other financial assets is set.

Nowhere, on the other hand, was there even the slightest awareness from
Trump that he might be playing with economic fire because if Treasuries
were seen as no longer risk-free that would shake to its very foundations
literally the core assumption of global financial markets, meaning that the
interest rate on every other financial asset=E2=80=94mortgages, car loans, =
domain.com
for businesses large and small=E2=80=94could go up perhaps by a lot.

This economic reality did not require him to brush up on the
post-Revolutionary War history of the founding of our national financial
system. Our nation had just seen the damage of even a threat of default
during the 2015 debt crisis=E2=80=94a threat that other, more successful
billionaires such as Warren Buffet likened to threatening =E2=80=9Ca nuclea=
r bomb=E2=80=9D
and that Michael Bloomberg called a =E2=80=9Cseismic event that says you ca=
n never
depend 100 percent on America's word anymore.=E2=80=9D

Third, one needs to consider these rather reckless comments on honoring our
debts in light of Trump=E2=80=99s overall fiscal plan. So far, he has put f=
orward a
tax cut plan that both the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation have
estimated as increasing the national debt by more than $11 trillion in debt
overn the next 10 year and that the TPC has estimated would increase the
debt by a staggering $34 trillion over 20 years! Sending a signal that a
new United States president would plan to run up the debt by untold
trillions while =E2=80=9Cknowing that if the economy crashed you could make=
 a deal=E2=80=9D
just might not be the best thing to do to enhance economic confidence in
locating new jobs and investment in the United States.

With appreciation to Alexander Hamilton=E2=80=94and apologies to the United=
 Negro
College Fund=E2=80=94perfect public domain.com built up over more than two cent=
uries is
a terrible thing to waste.
