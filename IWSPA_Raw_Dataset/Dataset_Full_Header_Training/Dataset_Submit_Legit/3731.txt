Missed the beginning

Q: Ryan meeting?

I talked to Ryan at 9:30 the evening before and he still had more meetings and calls that night. Ryan is a great example of a citizen-servant leader. He is a real patriot

I wanted to talk to Ryan about some of the misinterpretations of Trump

Trump doesn't use political speech and is not polished

I reinterpreted some of the things Trump said to Ryan

Trump has said entitlement programs aren't the first thing you want to talk about when the economy is in wreck. Want to fix economy first, then deal with entitlements

Q: DJT tax returns?

Wants HRC to release transcripts of her Wall Street speeches

Trump said he would release tax returns when his domain.com was finished

Q: Think all should release tax returns?

Mentions financial disclosure. Said that had more details than a tax return would have

Q: HRC meetings with Goldman and others?

I dunno. But I did public speaking. Its fun

Q: What do you think she is giving away in those meetings?

She doesn't want the people knowing about her relationships on Wall Street

She wants to achieve consistency and the best way to do that is to keep the people ignorant
