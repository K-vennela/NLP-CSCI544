OrganizationStatement

On December 18, 2015, the Organization and Bernie 2015 app=
eared in United States District Court on Bernie 2016=92s indication that it=
 would be seeking an injunction in the breach of contract action it filed a=
gainst the Organizationearlier that day. The Sanders campaign alleged that the Organization=
wrongfully terminated its access to the party-administered voter file syste=
m, VoteBuilder, following DNC=92s discovery that Sanders campaign personnel=
 had discovered a flaw in system security and had accessed Clinton campaign=
 proprietary score data.

The parties proceeded in the course of the hearing to settle the immediate =
issue before the Court. The Organizationagreed to restore access to VoteBuilder by =
the next day, and the campaign agreed to cooperate in an independent invest=
igation of the data breach.  The Sanders campaign also agreed as part of th=
is investigation to assume a share of the costs of the investigation.

The Organizationand the Sanders campaign agreed on the retention of CrowdStrike to =
conduct the investigation. Over a five-week period and the commitment to th=
e work of 128 hours, CrowdStrike examined user activity within VoteBuilder =
by three Democratic Presidential campaigns: Hillary for America, Bernie 201=
6, and O=92Malley for President.  Additionally, CrowdStrike conducted a for=
ensic examination of two systems belonging to the Bernie 2015 campaign. The=
 investigation sought to first identify whether any campaigns=92 users acce=
ssed data via the VoteBuilder system in an unauthorized fashion and then de=
termine the nature of any unauthorized access that did occur.

The cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has concluded the independent investigat=
ion agreed to by the Organizationand Bernie 2016.  It identified evidence of unauth=
orized access via four user accounts from the Bernie 2015 campaign.  All un=
authorized access occurred during a one-hour period from 10:41 to 11:42 EST=
 on December 16, 2015.

During that time, the four users conducted 25 searches using proprietary Hi=
llary for America score data across 11 states.  All of the results of these=
 searches were saved within the VoteBuilder system, with the exception of o=
ne instance where a user exported a statistical summary of a search using H=
FA scoring in New Hampshire.

CrowdStrike found no evidence of unauthorized access by the Hillary for Ame=
rica or O=92Malley for President campaigns.

Today, the Sanders campaign also voluntarily dismissed the breach of contra=
ct action pending against the DNC.
