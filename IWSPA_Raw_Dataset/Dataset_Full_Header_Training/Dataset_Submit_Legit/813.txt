...check out what NARAL has been up to this week fighting for reproductive
freedom!

1.      *NARAL launched new paid advertising campaign
<<<link>>
corps.html>
to
demand Congress repeal a discriminatory rule that prevents AmeriCorps
volunteers from referring women for abortion care.* Following a report this
week
<<<link>>
-violated-federal-law-on-abortion-funding>
from
NACHC which claims that AmeriCorps volunteers were serving as clinic
escorts, NARAL mobilized thousands of members and called on Congress to
change the oppressive rule, which disproportionately affects low-income
women and women of color. Check out the petition here
<<<link>>#.VyONddIrL0M>.

*=E2=80=9CLow-income women and women of color shouldn't be getting worse tr=
eatment
and less information than anyone else when it comes to their medical
decisions. It's time for the rule to be repealed so AmeriCorps volunteers
can help women get the care they need.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 Sasha Bruce, NARA=
L Pro-Choice
America Senior Vice President*

2.      *NARAL celebrated Hillary Clinton=E2=80=99s historic wins
<<<link>>>=
 in
the Acela primaries this week.* After winning 4 of 5 primary elections and
basically securing the Democratic nomination last Tuesday, Hillary Clinton
is proving that standing up for reproductive healthcare, paid family leave
and equal pay win elections in a serious way. We are so proud to support
and lift up the only true champion for reproductive freedom in this race.
Let=E2=80=99s take this all the way to the White House!

3.      *NARAL, partners call on Cruz to #FireTroy
<<<link>>>.* In an open letter
<<<link>>
eaders-call-ted-cruz-fire-troy-newman-presiden>,
NARAL president Ilyse Hogue, People For the American Way (PFAW) president
Michael Keegan, and Planned Parenthood VP Dawn Laguens called for the Ted
Cruz campaign to remove anti-choice extremist and Operation Rescue leader
Troy Newman from his so-called =E2=80=9CPro-Lifers for Cruz coalition.=E2=
=80=9D NARAL
denounced
<<<link>>
newman.html>
the
Cruz campaign=E2=80=99s acceptance of Newman=E2=80=99s endorsement in Novem=
ber, citing the
facts
<<<link>>
ist-with-a-histor/207011>
that
Newman has suggested that the 9/11 attacks and AIDS were retribution from
God against legal abortion and that the murder of abortion providers is
=E2=80=9Cjustifiable defense.=E2=80=9D

4.      *New data-driven ad campaign against Sen. Ayotte out as
NARAL endorses Maggie Hassan
<<<link>>
n.html>.
*National Journal
today is out with a story
<<<link>>> on
NARAL's new data-driven ad campaign against Sen. Ayotte (R-NH). The article
highlights how NARAL has used new polling
<<<link>>
ative.pdf>
to
learn that Sen. Ayotte's opposition to reproductive freedom is a
significant vulnerability and that it is particularly off-putting to
independents and Republicans.

Nationally, seven-in-ten Americans support legal access to abortion but
NARAL's polling shows that number is even higher in NH, where it is
supported by 78 percent of voters. Polling
<<<link>>
memo.pdf>
conducted
by NARAL showed that a clear majority of voters (60-75%) were *less *likely
to vote for a candidate for holding this extreme position. Watch the NARAL
ad here <<<link>>>.

5.      *Pro-Choice Legislation in Hawai'i making waves! (get it?)* NARAL
Pro-Choice America this week asked a governor to *sign *a bill into law. S.
2139 will require insurance companies to cover up to 12 months of
contraception dispensed at once and passed the legislature this week, a
practice that research shows increases consistent and correct usage of
birth control. NARAL president Ilyse Hogue sent a letter
<<<link>>

to
Governor David Ige encouraging him to make a stand for Hawai=E2=80=99ian wo=
