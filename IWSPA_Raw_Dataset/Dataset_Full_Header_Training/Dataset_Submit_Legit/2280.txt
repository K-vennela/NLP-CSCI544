There really isn't anything very damaging out there that I've seen. The Republicans in the Texas legislature look to be in favor of pretty massive spending on highway infrastructure, the worst thing I've seen is that they refuse to raise taxes to do so (and want to rely on shifting other spending instead): <<link>> Also, here's an infrastructure report card with info from 2012: <<link>>#p/state-facts/texas

I think you'd have to tie it to Congress if you want to hit on infrastructure.

Yup, talked to them, and they unfortunately do not have this.

Have you talked to the state party and do they have some examples before we do this?

Hi team,

Can you please pull research on how Texas has been impacted by Republican obstruction on infrastructure spending/anything else that you think might be relevant?

Thx!
