Hillary Clinton has won the Connecticut Democratic primary, according to the Associated Press.

Clinton campaigned hard on the message of gun safety in Connecticut, a little more than three years after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.

At various panels featuring the family members of gun-violence victims in Connecticut and elsewhere, Clinton and her surrogates sought to draw distinctions between the positions and past votes of the Democratic frontrunner and Bernie Sanders.

Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy backed Clinton's bid, along with the state's attorney general and lieutenant governor and a host of mayors from across the state.

Both of the state's U.S. senators, Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, also threw their support behind Clinton.



Connecticut allocates its 55 pledged delegates on a proportional basis.
