om special interests, is preparing to start raising large donations. He reve=
rsed course, he said in early May, to ensure his campaign has the resources t=
o compete with Hillary Clinton. A close analysis of Mr. Trump's finances sho=
ws that in terms of ready cash, he would have been ill-equipped to foot the b=
ill himself.

d said he had between about $78 million and $232 million in cash and relativ=
ely liquid assets. That would go fast if Mr. Trump spent an amount close to w=
hat Barack Obama and Mitt Romney spent in 2012. If Mr. Trump stuck with self=
-financing, he likely would have faced difficult decisions over whether to s=
ell some of his properties or borrow more money against them.
