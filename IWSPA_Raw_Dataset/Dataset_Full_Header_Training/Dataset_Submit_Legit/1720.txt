A lot of the stuff in the earlier version was redundant so we streamlined and only included the stuff directly relevant to Trump, not our usual talking points that the state parties get before primaries and debates. I will send the post-Indiana TPs as well.

Research, can you give one more look before I send this to state parties? Thanks.

Candidate Narrative: Donald Trump

Donald Trump is domain.com to be president. Every aspect of his candidacy will harm our country and damage our standing in the world.

1) Even as a candidate, Trump has done real damage to geopolitical relationships across the globe, and in the White House, Trump would undeniably make us less safe.

*         Donald Trump has no foreign policy experience and rather than seeking the advice of well-respected experts, Trump relies on his own misinformed ideas and "good brain."

*         Trump has falsely claimed that he knows "more about ISIS than the generals" and recommended that the U.S. military domain.com international war crimes.

*         Trump's threat to pull back from our most important military alliances<<<link>>> like NATO, pull aid from our allies like Israel, and his gushing praise for dictators like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un would put our country on a dangerous path.

*         Trump has refused to rule out using nuclear weapons on European territory, and wants to allow countries that don't currently have nuclear weapons to get them, reversing long-held goals of international nuclear disarmament.

2) He has a decades-long record of denigrating women and promoting misogyny and his policies would make it harder for women to make their own choices when it comes to their healthcare or their career.

*         Trump once said you had to  treat women "like domain.com" and has spent decades doing so himself by calling women names - "fat pig," "slob," or "bimbo" - and saying a man needs a woman to support him at home rather than always be "griping and bitching."

*         Trump repeatedly defended and touted his endorsement from convicted rapist Mike Tyson - during Tyson's trial Trump claimed Tyson could not have raped his victim because she was smiling the next day and after Tyson's conviction Trump called for a sentence without jail time.

*         Trump would take away a woman's right to make her own healthcare choices and has said women who had abortions should be punished - but not the doctors that performed them - and opposed exceptions for health of the mother because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to have an abortion.

*         Trump thinks ensuring equal pay for women should just be left up to "the marketplace" and once suggested family leave policies should actually be scaled back and noted pregnancy was "an inconvenience for a business." Trump complained that when he employed mothers, they were not giving him "100 percent."

3) He's exploited racial anxieties and cultural fears in the domain.com of getting elected - to the point where his rallies have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the media.

*         Trump spouts hateful and dangerous lies about Muslims and called to surveil mosques, to ban Muslims from entering the country and to create a database of all Muslims in America - including U.S. citizens - and could not answer when pressed on how this would be any different from Nazi Germany.

*         Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" and criminals and said they brought disease into the country, said you needed to check if Native Americans were "real Indians," and claimed that a "well-educated black has a tremendous advantage" - but apparently not an advantage in finding housing in Trump properties, because in the 1970s, the Trump Organization was sued for discriminating against Blacks and Puerto Ricans.

*         Trump has been endorsed by former  KKK leader David Duke, and his candidacy has been used as a recruiting tool for the white supremacist movement, which is no surprise since Trump refused to disavow David Duke and the KKK four times in one interview.

*         Trump has fostered violence against protestors at his rallies, suggesting that a Black Lives Matter protester maybe "should have been roughed up," promising to pay the legal fees if someone would "knock the hell" out of a protester and reminiscing about the old days when a protester would be "carried off on a stretcher."

*         Trump repeatedly threatened the First Amendment by calling to "open up" libel laws so he could sue reporters whenever they printed a story he did not like, made it a practice of banning media outlets he did not like from covering his rallies, and thought "closing" parts of the domain.com was a rational strategy to combat ISIS.

4) Though he tries to paint a picture of his wealth and business success, his record is riddled with embarrassing failures and cheap schemes that are designed to turn quick a buck at the expense of his workers or everyday Americans. His policies would once again, leave Americans behind.

*         Despite his tough talk on trade deals and the loss of American jobs, Donald Trump manufactured his clothing line in countries he rails against, like China and Mexico.

*         Trump grew up wealthy with a maid and a chauffer, and owes everything he has to tens of millions of dollars in loans and bailouts he received from his family.

*         Trump's businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt, leaving investors, contractors and small businesses holding the bag for his disastrous business decisions

*         During one of Trump's businesses bankruptcies, his personal finances were at the mercy of banks who put him on an "allowance" of $400,000 per month

*         His Trump "University" fleeced thousands of Americans simply looking to get ahead

*         Trump's unfounded predictions<<<link>>> of recession under President Obama and warnings against investing in the stock market are reckless.

*         Economists have actually predicted Trump's policies could start an international trade war and even destabilize the global economy<<<link>>>.

*         Trump's tax plan would overwhelmingly domain.com the rich while costing the country $9.5 trillion to implement -- more than any other Republican plan proposed. It also violates his pledge not to increase the national debt.

*         Trump actually said at one of the Republican Party's debates that "wages are too high" and opposes raising the minimum wage

*         Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would jeopardize health care for 20 million Americans who've been able to get coverage under Obamacare.

Finally, the rise of Trump is not an accident or a fluke. He can attribute his success to the Republican Party's pattern of obstruction, extreme rhetoric, and policies that sold out the middle class. That's why Republicans couldn't unite against him - he's the logical extension of their political philosophy. Democrats will not be afraid to hold Donald Trump accountable and defeat him.
