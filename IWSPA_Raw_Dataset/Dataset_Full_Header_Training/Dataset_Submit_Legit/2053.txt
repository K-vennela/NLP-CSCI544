SL: Dangerous Donald's impact on our schools

Donald Trump's dangerous rhetoric has not only been damaging to the domain.com of the electoral process-- now his behavior is affecting our students' experience in our schools. Yesterday, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and Representative Mark Pocan joined a Organizationmedia call to discuss Teacher Appreciation Week and the disaster that Donald Trump has already brought to the American education system.

Read what people are saying below:

Randi Weingarten: Donald Trump's Rhetoric Has Contaminated Schools
<<<link>>>EDUCATION WEEK // ANDREW UJIFUSA

Forget Donald Trump's plans to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education or allegations of fraud against Trump University: The real estate executive has already poisoned public schools, according to American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, by fostering a toxic environment that encourages bullying.

In a conference call with reporters on Thursday set up by the Organization, Weingarten blasted the real estate executive for his "xenophobia" and his "promotion of violence." And she said that it's too late to turn back the clock on the negative effect he's already had on public schools.

...

There have also been reports of incidents like Donald Trump's name being chanted by fans at a Wisconsin high school soccer game, along with "build that wall" and racial slurs. (Trump has pledged to halt illegal immigration from Mexico by building a wall along the southern border, and by making the Mexican government pay for it.)

...

Make no mistake, Weingarten and Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, who was also on the call, blasted Trump for his other positions on education too. Weingarten said she was not surprised that one of Trump's high-profile surrogates is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who has said teachers' unions need a punch in the face.

"What we're seeing is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party be anti-teacher and anti-public education," the AFT president said.

Teachers union: Trump's comments encourage school bullies
<<<link>>>THE HILL // TIM DEVANEY

Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is promoting a "climate of bullying" in schools, the head of a teachers union supporting Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said Thursday.

Teachers call it the "Trump effect."

They say Trump's rhetoric encourages violence and racism - not only on the campaign trail, but also in the classroom.

"Donald Trump appeals to the worst elements of our society," American Federation of Teachers (AFT) President Randi Weingarten told reporters Thursday. His rhetoric "is really creating bullying and violence in schools."

To Get a Sense of Trump's Education Policies, Look No Further Than Christie<<<link>>>

NJ SPOTLIGHT // JOHN MOONEY

What exactly is Donald Trump's education platform? Democrats are hoping voters look to New Jersey and Gov. Chris Christie to find out.

In a campaign defined so far by sound bites and histrionics, it has been anyone's guess as to what the now-presumptive Republican presidential nominee has in mind when it comes to federal education policy, among any number of issues.

But a day after Trump all but secured the GOP nomination by winning the Indiana primary, Democrats weren't waiting to find out, and they used Christie and New Jersey as domain.com A.

In a series of press phone calls, the Organization yesterday enlisted New Jersey's biggest teachers union and two Democratic leaders to discuss how Trump would emulate Christie in his education policies.

The committee followed up with a call with American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten, with much the same message.

None of the criticisms were new. From the unions, it was Christie's full frontal attack on their leadership from Day 1. Trump's own one-liners about gutting the federal education department and the checkered history of Trump University fit the pattern, they said.

Weingarten described a "'bully" culture that Trump was bringing to the presidential race and the country as a whole, one she said that Christie has already embodied in New Jersey.

"It's not a surprise that one of Trump's top surrogates, and possible running mates, is the infamous 'I want to punch teachers in the face' Chris Christie," Weingarten said on the call.
