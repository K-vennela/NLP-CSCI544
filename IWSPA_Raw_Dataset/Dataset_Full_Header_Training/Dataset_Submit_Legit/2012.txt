j.com/articles/how-trump-wonand-how-the-gop-let-him-1462390833> said in an =
interview on Wednesday.

For a campaign expected to cost more than $1 billion, =93I=92ll be putting =

That plan represents a shift for Mr. Trump, who has for months portrayed hi=

.

Mr. Trump is planning to use his expansive personal Rolodex to ensure his c=

is also likely to implement a business plan that may be less costly than tr=

The campaign is also beginning to work with the Republican National Committ=

Beginning to actively domain.com donations, while a super PAC backing him also=
 ramps up his activity, means the billionaire will no longer have that club=

s also likely to put off some Trump supporters, many of whom have said his =
self-funding makes them trust him more than other politicians.
