We'd planned for this for the weekend - as part of our Factivist push. But I'm seeing if we can get the HTML version locked for tomorrow.

Hi, we have a surrogates call tomorrow and would love to push this out. Do you think we'll have an html version or we should just use the PDF?

We don't right this second, but we can make that happen.

This is really helpful. Do you have it in an html/Outlook version that's easy to email out? I prefer to have it in the body of the email so people can scroll through without downloading PDF on their phones.

Hi, all -

We've put together this one pager with a quick description of all our social channels to share with potential surrogates, and Amy asked me to pass it along in case it's useful for all of you!
