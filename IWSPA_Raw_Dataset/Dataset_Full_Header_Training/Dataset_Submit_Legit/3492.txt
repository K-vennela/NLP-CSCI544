In the last week, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has walked back from his pledge to release his tax returns<<<link>>>, vowed to slash taxes for those at the top (like himself), been mocked for pretending to be his own publicist<<<link>>>, refused to address his well-documented history of misogyny<<<link>>>, insulted one of our country's most important allies<<<link>>>, and sat back as his campaign called their selection of a white supremacist delegate a "database error." This is just the latest in a long history of backpedaling, half-truths and lies from Trump. With each day on the campaign trail, Donald Trump gives voters more examples of his recklessness, lack of judgment and unstable temperament. It's obvious that he's domain.com to be commander in chief.

These are just a few of the many reasons why Democrats will head into the general election energized as we fight for the values and priorities of the American people. As we move closer to our convention and the election in November, it's clearer than ever we must elect a Democrat as our 45th president.

Trump's financials: it's "none of your business"

Never mind that Donald Trump previously stated that he "probably wouldn't have a problem with" releasing his tax returns or that if you're running for president, "at a minimum, probably, you're going to have to show your returns." But this week, when he released his Personal Financial Disclosures - they still hid the truth<<<link>>>. His refusal to release his returns breaks from the precedent set by every major-party presidential nominee dating back to 1976. Trump's justification? It's "none of your business." But the hypocrisy doesn't stop there. Trump just announced that all vice presidential hopefuls looking to join his train wreck of a ticket will have to turn over their tax returns for vetting. How ironic<<<link>>>.

Trump's refusal to release his tax returns and the false claim that voters wouldn't learn anything from them anyway, show that Trump is more than willing to keep misleading the American people. If he can't manage to hold himself to his own standards, that begs the question, what is he hiding? From withholding tax returns, to his plans to tear up the most important financial reforms<<<link>>> in decades, Trump and his dangerous ideas shouldn't step foot in the White House. Hardworking American families cannot afford Trump's dangerous ideas on the economy, which would only domain.com those at the very top.

Important Polls

*         According to a poll<<<link>>> from CBS and the New York Times, 84 percent of Republicans say their party is divided now.

*         According to a poll<<<link>>> from CBS and the New York Times, 80 percent of Democratic voters are hopeful about their party's future.

What people are writing in the states

Our nation is in the midst of a worsening infrastructure crisis, but Republicans in Congress have refused to act to ensure safety on our roads and bridges. This week was National Infrastructure Week, which highlights the common interests of labor and business in calling for additional investments in infrastructure. Democrats around the country have shown that from now until November 8th, we're going to hold Republicans up and down the ballot accountable for their divisive and dangerous policies.

Below is a sampling of the work from our state parties:
