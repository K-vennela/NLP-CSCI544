Great news! So the event will be closed to the press, we will have our own =
internal photographer there but that will be just for our own use (PAC news=
letter)
No specific topics just general state of the races followed by 5-10 minutes=
 of Q&A
Just so Mr. Userknows our plan is to both let him and Sean Spicer from =
the RNC speak respectively about what they see happening in the state of th=
e race at the presidential and congressional levels. Also we have confirmed=
 and the event will be held in the Columbus Room at Union Station
Please let me know if he has any additional questions
Thanks for all your help
Raquel,
Moses has come through again, but User has a few additional questions below=
 that I am hoping you can answer so that he can lock it

down. Copying Moses on this, too. Thx

Gordon
