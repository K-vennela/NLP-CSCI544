Donald Trump said on Monday that, =93at a certain point,=94 the United Stat=
es should shoot at Russian planes that barrel roll over U.S. Air Force plan=
es.

Commenting on a Russian SU-27 that conducted a barrel roll over a U.S. airc=
raft on Friday, the second such maneuver a Russian plane has conducted in t=
he past month, Trump told Indiana radio host Charly Butcher that Obama shou=
ld first call Putin to object.

=93Normally, an Obama, let=92s say a president, because you want to make at=
 least a call or two, but normally Obama would call up Putin and say, =91Li=
sten, do us a favor, don=92t do that, get that maniac, just stop it.=92 But=
 we don=92t have that kind of a president. He=92s gonna be out playing golf=
 or something,=94 Trump said.

=93But I don=92t know, at a certain point, you can=92t take it,=94 the busi=
nessman continued. =93I mean, at a certain point, you have to do something =
that, you just can=92t take that. That is not right. It=92s against all, yo=
u know, when you talk about Geneva convention, there=92s gotta be things th=
at are against it. You can=92t do that. That=92s called taunting. But it sh=
ould certainly start with diplomacy and it should start quickly with a phon=
e call to Putin, wouldn=92t you think?=94

He went on to say that, if diplomacy didn=92t work, the U.S. should open fi=
re.

=93And if that doesn=92t work out, I don=92t know, you know, at a certain p=
oint, when that sucker comes by you, you gotta shoot,=94 Trump said. =93You=
 gotta shoot. I mean, you gotta shoot. And it=92s a shame. It=92s a shame. =
It=92s a total lack of respect for our country and it=92s a total lack of r=
espect for Obama. Which as you know, they don=92t respect.=94
