Anthony:

We were thrilled to witness the results of your hard work the past few years. You did so well, your speech was thought provoking and funny and the ceremony was very moving. I also thought the rabbi was amazing and extremely articulate.
Bernie and Amy:

Your heartfelt and beautiful speeches are something Anthony will cherish forever. 

You are a wonderful family and we are indeed lucky to know you.
