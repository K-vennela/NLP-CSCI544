DPVA/McAuliffe wants us to steer clear of hitting Trump on this call. Virgi=

Mark and User: Can I kick this to RR2?

I think these TPs are great.

I would add 2 things. First thing I would add is to discuss the racist root=
s of this policy. These quotes are really sickening, and I think it will ad=
vance our cause if we can put Republicans on the side of defending this sen=
timent. From NYT Op-Ed<<<link>>
cial-right-restored-in-virginia/>:

The political leaders who amended Virginia=92s constitution in 1902 to make=
 disenfranchisement laws even more onerous =97 and to write black people ou=
t of civic life =96 said openly that they were doing so to =93eliminate the=
 darkey as a political factor in this State in less than five years, so tha=

=94 A leading Virginia politician said plainly at the time that the new law=

Second =96 I would add that Dems will remain vigilant, especially in this e=

Deshundra Jefferson, OrganizationSpokesperson

Thank you for joining us for this on-the-record call. Last month, Governor =
Terry McAuliffe signed an executive order restoring voting rights for more =
than 200,000 people with felony convictions. The Governor=92s actions overt=
urned a lingering vestige of the Jim Crow laws that kept African Americans =
from voting, but Virginia Republicans are accusing him of =93political oppo=
rtunism.=94
It is deeply disturbing that as our nation moves forward, one of the countr=
y=92s major political parties is attempting to drag us backward.
We are pleased to welcome the Assistant Democratic Leader and civil rights =
activist Representative Jim Clyburn, Representative Bobby Scott, and Terry =
Garrett, to this call.
I would now like to turn the call over to the Assistant Leader who has long=
 been on the forefront of the fight for civil and voting rights.

Talking Points for Assistant Democratic Leader Rep. Jim Clyburn

=B7         The right to vote is the cornerstone of democracy and the found=
ation upon which all other rights are built.

=B7         The Voting Rights Act has been the single most important tool t=
o protect the right to vote over the last half century until Shelby County =
v. Holder opened the door for underhanded schemes that reduced electoral po=
wer in communities of color.

=B7         We see that clearly in states like North Carolina where one bad=
 law reversed an entire generation of electoral progress.

=B7         In Arizona, the DNC, the DSCC, the Arizona Democratic Party, an=
d impacted voters took the extraordinary step of suing the state of Arizona=
 to correct the problems that led to five-hour lines during the presidentia=
l primary.

=B7         Republican-controlled state legislatures across the country are=
 passing restrictive voting laws, under the guise of fighting voter fraud, =
but they have only made it harder for groups that tend to vote Democratic =
=96 people of color, women, and students =96 to cast their ballots.

=B7         Governor McAuliffe are  is doing the opposite, they are he is t=
rying to make it easier to vote but Virginia Republicans are resistant to h=
is attempts to make the Commonwealth a more fair, and inclusive society.

=B7         Virginia=92s felony disenfranchisement law was passed to keep A=
frican-Americans from gaining political power.

=B7         Make no mistake =96 the GOP seems to believe their path to vict=
ory lies in restricting access to the polls. So if you ask me, the real pol=
itical opportunism lies with the Republican Party.

=B7         It=92s time to close the door on these types of laws but the Re=
publican Party is dead set sent on being on the wrong side of history.

=B7         I have stood on the front lines of the fight for civil rights, =
and I applaud Governor McAuliffe for doing the right thing.

=B7         Thank you for joining us today, and I am turning the call over =
my friend and colleague, Representative Bobby Scott.
Talking Points for Representative Bobby Scott

=B7         Thank you, Congressman. It was a pleasure to have you join this=
 call.

=B7         The Virginia Republicans need to end their campaign of misinfor=
mation.

=B7         Virginia Republicans have been desperately trying to paint Gove=
rnor McAuliffe=92s executive order as =93political opportunism,=94 in order=
 to divert attention from their defense of an overtly racist law.

=B7         Yesterday, the Governor=92s Office released a demographic break=
down of the 200,000 people whose voting rights will now be restored.

=B7         What stood out for me was that 45.9 percent of disenfranchised =
voters are African-Americans even though blacks only account for 19.4 perce=
nt of the Commonwealth=92s entire population.

=B7         That clearly illustrates that the impact of this law was most k=
eenly felt by African-Americans.

=B7         Governor McAuliffe=92s actions are consistent with just about e=
very other state in the Union. There=92s nothing partisan, unusual or suspe=
ct about restoring voting rights for people who have paid their debt to soc=
iety.

=B7         Denying them that right is partisan. Denying them that right is=
 unusual given that Virginia is only one of four states that requires domain.com=
e with felony convictions to petition the Governor to have their voting rig=
hts restored. And denying that right is suspect given the origins of the fe=
lony disenfranchisement laws.

=B7         Virginia Republicans are using every scare tactic they can drea=
m up to attack the Governor=92s motivations.

=B7         They claim that this gives license to rapists and murders murde=
rers to sit on juries, while ignoring the fact that 79 percent of the domain.com=
e whose rights were restored had non-violent felonies.

=B7         They also claim that this is a partisan ploy that will give Dem=
ocrats the edge in November. If that=92s truly the case, then Republicans h=
ave been coasting into office all these years by limiting Democratic turnou=
t.

=B7         I have a challenge for the Republican Party of Virginia. I want=
 them to prove that they are not motivated by political opportunism by repe=
aling the Commonwealth=92s restrictive photo ID law, by implementing early =
voting, and to fully fund the replacement of our aging voting equipment.

=B7         I challenge them to break down the unnecessary barriers that we=
re erected to keep people of color away from the polls. If they are serious=
 about protecting the integrity of our democracy then they should be willin=
g to work with Democrats at the congressional level to restore the critical=
 protections of the Voting Rights Act.
