Good Monday morning. BREAKING -- "Letter from Hanoi," by Isaac Dovere: "Obama, silent on human rights, lifts arms embargo on Vietnam ... [S]aid nothing about democratic reform": "With the embalmed body of Communist national forefather Ho Chi Minh laying under lights just a block away at his gray mausoleum, President Obama [today] signed the dissolution of the nearly 50-year embargo on selling arms to Vietnam, ending one of the last vestiges of the Vietnam War." <<link>>

"HERE'S YOUR HAT. What's your hurry?" ... "Bernie Loses His Halo: Even progressives are criticizing him now after he's shown a harder edge," by Bill Sher of Campaign for America's Future, for Politico Magazine: "[I]t's no longer taboo in liberal circles to attack Sanders as he drags out the nomination process at a time when many are itching to turn their fire on Donald Trump. And if his reputation in the party is being damaged outside his base, that will make it harder for him to extract concessions from Clinton regarding the platform and party nomination rules at the convention." <<link>>

IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED the "Saturday Night Live" cold open with Hillary (Kate McKinnon) and Bernie (Larry David) in a bar in L.A. at closing time (Sanders won't leave), treat yourself. "Hillary": "You should be proud. You ran a damn good campaign." "Bernie": "I'm RUNNING a good campaign." ... "Hillary": "I do NOT like humor, but THAT was funny!" <<link>>

TRUMPMENTUM - "Trump passes Clinton in polling average," by Nick Gass: "On the strength of two polls released Sunday, [Trump] advantage of 43.4 percent to 43.2 percent in the Real Clear Politics Average." <<link>> ... RCP <<link>> 

N.Y. POST cover, "POLL VAULT: Trump flies, Hill cries in 4th straight prez survey" <<link>>

PAGING GAIL COLLINS - "Trump acknowledges climate change - at his golf course: The billionaire, who called global warming a hoax, warns of its dire effects in his company's application to build a sea wall," by Ben Schreckinger: Trump is "applying for permission to erect a coastal protection works to prevent erosion at his seaside golf resort, Trump International Golf Links & Hotel Ireland, in County Clare. A domain.com application ... cites global warming and its consequences - increased erosion due to rising sea levels and extreme weather this century -- as a chief justification for building the structure." <<link>>

ADIOS, #NEVERTRUMP -- "Graham privately urges Republicans to support Trump," by CNN's Jeremy Diamond: "Sen. Lindsey Graham ... urged GOP donors at a private fundraiser Saturday in Florida to unite behind Trump's campaign and stressed the importance of keeping likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from the White House." <<link>>

FIRST GENTLEMAN - WashPost A1, bottom left corner, "Bill Clinton finds his stride on campaign trail: The former president keeps a low profile as he woos voters and pols," by Karen Tumuly in Cayey, Puerto Rico (online: "Under the radar, Bill Clinton finds his voice as a supporting actor"): "Bill Clinton's schedule many days is more packed than Hillary's, though by design it rarely registers on the national radar. This is the invisi-Bill campaign. The former president ... remains a big draw on the off-Broadway domain.com." <<link>>

HILLARY STRATEGERY - "Clinton shrugs, sees benefits in Trump's personal attacks," by AP's Lisa Lerer and Catherine Lucey: "Clinton has stopped explicitly mentioning her role in history and joking about being the 'youngest woman president.' That's by design: Those kinds of direct appeals weren't working with voters. 'De-emphasize the "first" talk,' advised a research report done by Emily's List. 'They already know she'd be the first woman president,' the report said of donors, 'but we don't get anything by reminding them.'" <<link>>

BERNIE STRATEGERY - "Latino vote in California targeted by Clinton, Sanders," by AP's Mike Blood in L.A.: June 7 "amounts to the finale of the 2015 primary season. A come-from-behind win for Sanders in California - a Clinton stronghold and home to 1 in 8 people in the United States - would end the former first lady's campaign with a thud, allowing Sanders to refresh his argument that he's the party's best chance to defeat Trump." <<link>> 

SPINNING THE CLASSICS ... WashPost homepage: "Readers constantly ask for a fact check of Clinton's false Bosnia claim, so here's our original 2015 report," by "Fact Checker" Glenn Kessler. SPOILER ALERT: "Clinton's tale of landing at Tuzla airport 'under sniper fire' and then running for cover is simply not credible. Photographs and video of the arrival ceremony ... tell a very different story. Four Pinocchios." <<link>>

ENGAGED! Jonathan Capehart of the WashPost and "Morning Joe" and Nick domain.com, Assistant Chief of Protocol at the State Department, were introduced more than five years ago by Jed Hastings and Joe Solmonese. After four months of planning the surprise proposal, Jonathan popped the question to an unsuspecting Nick just before sunrise yesterday.

"Growing up, I remember how often I was told by white elders that black folks liked to live on the other side of town, going to rundown schools and living through indignities. The civil rights movement helped me to see that was a pack of lies." 15-min. video <<link>>  

CORRECTIONS: Our subject line was wrong yesterday: Trump led Clinton by 2 in ABC/WP. In SPOTTED, General Mark Milley graduated undergrad from Princeton, not West Point.

THE FUTURE OF THE N.Y. TIMES - Executive Editor Dean Baquet emails the staff on Friday: "[T]he newsroom will have to change significantly-swiftly and fearlessly. The task laid out in the company's Path Forward vision for the future is huge - we aim to double our digital revenue and more than double our number of committed digital readers by 2020. ... The digital news marketplace nudges us away from covering incremental developments ... Instead, it favors hard-hitting 'only-in-The New York Times' coverage: authoritative journalism and information readers can use to navigate their lives. ...

"While no layoffs are planned in the newsroom for this calendar year, the company is planning other measures to cut costs, including in the newsroom. I've made clear that the changing economics of journalism make it unlikely we can sustain a newsroom of this size, which is larger than it has ever been. ... We have already announced major commitments to international reporting and visual journalism, including video. And I am determined to diversify the newsroom so that it looks more like the world we aspire to reflect and cover. ...

"I also want to underscore how enormous ... an undertaking it is to create a print hub, a desk designed to build the best print paper each night. ... This structure will make it far easier to imagine smaller, more focused coverage clusters that operate apart from big desks. In the past, an editor who ran education coverage across The Times had to convince the metropolitan and national editors to run stories that fit their sections. Now, to be provocative, it could be that some important subjects -- climate change, education, health care, to name a few -- should function on their own." Full text <<link>> 

MEDIAWATCH - "Michelle Fields to resume covering Donald Trump -- for Huffington Post," by CNNMoney's Tom Kludt: "Fields [age 28], ... who had Donald Trump's campaign manager charged with battery ... served as a reporter for The Daily Caller, PJ Media and, most recently, Breitbart News." <<link>>

MARGARET SULLIVAN, formerly N.Y. Times Public Editor, debuts as WashPost media columnist with lead spot of Style section, "A great era to be a young reporter" (online: "Now, there's one more reason to be a journalist - you can help save journalism"): "Just look at the political sphere, where the candidates ... may regard facts as fungible, and the electorate doesn't seem to care. ... Around the country, journalism programs are shrinking, and applications are down. But then again, many of the best journalists have never set foot in a journalism class." <<link>>

An H.S.B.C. lawyer later described Falciani's crime as 'the largest robbery of a bank ever committed in the world.' ...
