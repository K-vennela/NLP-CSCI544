5th Anniversary of the Death of Osama Bin Laden

*         Five years ago, U.S. Special Operations forces undertook a missio=
n that killed Osama Bin Laden during a raid against his compound in Abbotta=
bad, Pakistan.

*         We have never lost sight of our commitment to defeating al-Qa'ida=
 and bringing to justice those responsible for attacking the United States.

*         Not only has Osama Bin Laden been killed but most of his top lieu=
tenants have been taken off the battlefield and we continue to systematical=
ly pursue al-Qa'ida terrorists who remain.

*         We have severely degraded core al-Qa'ida and we have maintained s=
trong pressure utilizing all of our resources as al-Qa'ida has attempted to=
 exert influence in places like Yemen, parts of Africa, Iraq, and Syria.

*         For example, just this month the U.S. military conducted a strike=
 in Syria that targeted longtime senior al-Qa'ida operative Abu Firas al Su=
ri who had been an associate of Osama Bin Laden for decades.

*         Today what remains of al-Qa'ida is in hiding and has great diffic=
ult moving around or planning to carry out large scale operations and there=
 is no question our homeland is more secure from its threat.

*         Of course the challenge of terrorism remains. That is why we have=
 a comprehensive approach to counter terrorist groups, including ISIL, that=
 incorporates and builds on many of the lessons we have learned in our purs=
uit of al-Qa'ida and its other affiliates.

Supreme Court

*         Today, the President is interviewing with six local television st=
ations - from Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin and Arizona - =
to continue to make the case for why Senate Republicans need to consider th=
e President's nominee for the Supreme Court.

*         The President fulfilled his constitutional responsibility by nomi=
nating Chief Judge Merrick Garland - an eminently qualified American - to t=
he Supreme Court.

*         He did his job. Now, Senate Republicans should do their jobs, and=
 quickly move to give the President's nominee a fair hearing and an up or d=
own vote.

*         That is what the Constitution dictates, and that's what the Ameri=
can people expect and deserve from their leaders.

Meeting with Senators

*         Judge Garland has continued meeting with numerous Senators, but L=
eader McConnell has stated he will not meet with the Preident's nominee.

*         Still, 18 Senate Republicans have either met with or indicated th=
at they would be willing to meet with Judge Garland.

*         To do otherwise - to follow in the footsteps of Senator McConnell=
 - would be to abdicate their constitutional duty.

*         Presidents do not stop working in the final year of their term. A=
nd it's becoming clear that many Republican senators realize they shouldn't=
 either.
