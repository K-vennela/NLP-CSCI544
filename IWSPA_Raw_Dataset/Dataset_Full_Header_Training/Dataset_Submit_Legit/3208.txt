User,

How do you feel about doing a national press call ahead of the NRA Leadership Forum on Friday? The messaging would be that Trump, McConnell, Ryan et al are in the pockets of the NRA.

We reach out to Rep. Esty who represents parts of Newtown, CT; Rep. Aguliar who represents parts of San Bernardino, CA; and a Rep from Chicago to speak on the call.

Please let me know if this is a go!
