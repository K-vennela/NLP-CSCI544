Loose Cannons Tend To Misfire: Donald Trump=E2=80=99s Dangerous Foreign Pol=
icy

Continuing his efforts to convince the Republican establishment and the
American people that he=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cpresidential,=E2=80=9D Donald Tr=
ump is set to give a
foreign policy address today. But nothing he can say can hide the long list
of dangerous national security proposals he=E2=80=99s put forward over the =
course
of this campaign. He has used the most reckless rhetoric of any major
presidential candidate in modern history.

These are not off-the-cuff quips. Despite his frequent contradictions and
displays of ignorance, Trump has a long record of recklessness and has
espoused a worldview that goes against everything that makes America great.
A Trump presidency risks leaving both our country and the world
dramatically less safe.

As Hillary Clinton has said, loose cannons tend to misfire.

Check out some of Trump=E2=80=99s most irresponsible comments and proposals=
, and
experts=E2=80=99 condemnation of them, below:
