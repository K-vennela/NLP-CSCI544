SL: Grassley Floats SCOTUS Pick That Would Help Trump "Punish" Women

Last week, Chuck Grassley said it would be a "gamble<<<link>>>" to let Donald Trump fill the Supreme Court vacancy. But it seems Grassley is now fine with the most dangerous presidential nominee in history - a man who said women should be "punished<<<link>>>" for an abortion - shaping the court for generations. Yesterday<<<link>>>, Grassley said Trump would nominate "the right type of people" and specifically cited Judge William Pryor as someone Trump might appoint.

Let's take a look at some of Judge Pryor's greatest hits:

*         Pryor called<<<link>>> Roe v. Wade "the worst abomination in the history of constitutional law."

*         Pryor opposes<<<link>>> abortion even in cases of rape or incest.

*         Pryor urged<<<link>>> Congress to repeal Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

*         Pryor was the only<<<link>>> Attorney General in the nation to file an amicus brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the federal remedy for victims of sexual assault in the Violence Against Women Act was unconstitutional.

*         In 2005, Lambda Legal called Pryor "the most demonstrably antigay judicial nominee in recent memory<<<link>>>."

*         Editorial boards across the country denounced<<<link>>> George W. Bush's nomination of Pryor to the Eleventh domain.com.

"No one is more qualified to immediately serve on the Supreme Court than Chief Judge Merrick Garland. The fact that Chuck Grassley refuses to give him a fair hearing or up-and-down vote betrays his constitutional responsibility. The fact that Grassley is waiting for Donald Trump to fill the seat with a divisive extremist like William Pryor who will implement Trump's plan to 'punish<<<link>>>' women for abortions is downright shameful. Grassley and the Senate Republicans need to do their jobs and confirm Chief Judge Garland rather than playing political games that put our democracy's checks and balances at risk." - TJ Helmstetter, Organizationspokesperson
