Good Thursday morning. It's 67 days to Cleveland, 74 days to Philly, 180 days to election.




SCOOP DU JOUR - "Biden wanted Warren as his VP: The Massachusetts senator was 'noncommittal,' but warned of a backlash against his pro-Wall Street votes in Senate," by Glenn Thrush and Annie Karni: "Joe Biden took months to decide he wouldn't run for president - but he was sold on Elizabeth Warren as his running mate from the start ... And he still thinks the Massachusetts firebrand would be Hillary Clinton's best choice to replace him as the nation's No. 2 in January 2017. ... Biden broached the idea, almost matter of factly, to Warren during a much-hyped lunch meeting at the vice president's residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory last September." 
<<link>>




--"Joe Biden: 'I Would Have Been the Best President,'" by ABC News' Margaret Chadbourn: "Biden [told ABC's Robin Roberts] he 'would have been the best president' if he had mounted a successful campaign in the 2015 election, but that forgoing the race was the right decision for his family." <<link>>




FIRST LOOK: Playbook exclusive ... DOUG SOSNIK -- former President Bill Clinton adviser, now one of the most interesting big-think political geographers - is out with one of his famous memos, "The Question Every Republican has to Answer: Did They Support Trump in 2016?": "At least once in a politician's career they are forced to make a decision that will follow them for the rest of their lives, like the vote to confirm Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court a quarter century ago or the decision to invade Iraq in 2003. For today's Republican leaders and elected officials that moment has arrived. They have to decide whether they support Donald Trump for the presidency of the United States. ...




--"The State of Play for Democrats ... Clinton isn't perceived to be wrapping up the Democratic nomination from the position of strength that her victory totals would suggest. Further complicating Clinton's primary end-game strategy is the fact that she can't risk alienating the Sanders voters who she will need in the general election. ...




--"The General Election Electoral Map Looks Daunting for Trump ... His only route runs through the former industrial heartland of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. A third-party challenge would almost certainly widen Democrats' advantage, opening up the possibility that we'll see the biggest political landslide in a three-person race since 1980, when Ronald Reagan carried 44 states and secured 489 electoral votes. ...




--"Consequences of Trump's Candidacy for Senate Control ... With Trump at the top of the ticket, no party has been more vulnerable to a political tsunami in the U.S. Senate since 1980 when Ronald Reagan was elected president in a landslide that saw12 seats change hands from Democrats to Republicans, giving Republicans a majority in the Senate for the first time since 1954. Increasingly, Senate election outcomes mirror the presidential outcome in states. ...

--"[I]f Trump's candidacy shows signs of imploding, second tier vulnerable Republican incumbents, like McCain (AZ), Burr (NC) and Grassley (IA), will ... be at ... risk." 5-page memo  <<link>> ... 6-slide deck, "Clinton v. Trump"  <<link>>




UNDERSTANDING TRUMP ... "AMERICA'S MIDDLE CLASS MELTDOWN" -- Financial Times, p. 1 above fold (USA edition), "Household income tumbles in majority of US cities this century: More than 80% suffer fall -- Decline fuels election discontent -- Industrial areas hard hit," by Sam Fleming and Shawn Donnan in D.C.: "More than four-fifths of America's metropolitan areas have seen household incomes decline this century ... The research on urban centres that are home to three-quarters of the US population shows that median household incomes ... grew in just 39 out of 229 metro areas between 1999 and 2014. ...

"Pew's research [in consultation with the FT] illuminates a major source of that anxiety but also raises questions about some of America's most celebrated economic success stories. It reveals a steady erosion of the middle class across the US map, with 203 out of the 229 metro areas experiencing a decline in the share of their populations that are middle income. At the same time, 172 metro areas saw increases in the share of their population that is upper income, and 160 saw a rising lower-income share." <<link>> ... Pew study, "The Geography of America's Shrinking Middle Class" <<link>> 

--NOT JUST RUST BELT ... "For decades, the Sun Belt promised jobs but the problems of wage inequality are catching up," by FT's Sam Fleming and Shawn Donnan: "The erosion of America's middle class ... is often portrayed as a phenomenon brought about by the collapse of well-paying manufacturing jobs ... thanks to increased automation and competition from China. But a new study ... points to just how widespread the damage to America's middle has been and how divided the country's class structures are becoming." <<link>>

LIFE ONLINE - N.Y. Times A1, below fold, Farhad Manjoo's "State of the Art" column, "Algorithms With Agendas And the Sway of Facebook" (online: "Facebook's Bias Is Built-In, and Bears Watching"): "If it wanted to, Facebook could try to sway elections, favor certain policies, or just make you feel a certain way about the world, as it once proved it could do in an experiment devised to measure how emotions spread online. There is no evidence Facebook is doing anything so alarming now. The danger is nevertheless real. The biggest worry is that Facebook doesn't seem to recognize its own power, and doesn't think of itself as a news organization with a well-developed sense of institutional ethics
 and responsibility ...

"Facebook also has an unmistakable corporate ethos and point of view. The company is staffed mostly by wealthy coastal Americans who tend to support Democrats ... Zuckerberg is for free trade, more open immigration and for a certain controversial brand of education reform." <<link>>

** A message from the Alzheimer's Association: Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. Every hour, Alzheimer's costs taxpayers $18.3 million dollars. Today, Alzheimer's costs the country $236 billion a year and that will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation. Funding for Alzheimer's research must increase.

DAILY DONALD - Trump, in shift from AP interview the day before, told Fox's Greta Van Susteren last night that he may release his tax returns, after all, per Hanna Trudo: "I'll release. Hopefully before the election I'll release ... And I'd like to release. ... You learn very little from a tax return."

--"Romney ... blasted Trump in a ... Facebook post. 'It is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters, especially one who has not been subject to public scrutiny in either military or public service.' In February 2015, Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt that he would 'certainly' release at least some of his returns if he ran for the White House." <<link>> ...Mitt's Facebook post <<link>>




--NYT A1, "Donald Trump, Bucking Calls to Unite, Claims 'Mandate' to Be Provocative," by Patrick Healy and Maggie Haberman: "Mr. Trump, in a telephone interview, compared his candidacy to hit Broadway shows and championship baseball teams, saying that success begot success and that he would be foolish to change his behavior now. 'You win the pennant and now you're in the World Series - you gonna change? People like the way I'm doing.' ... 'In a Broadway theater, the best, the best, absolute best sale is called "word of mouth,"' said Mr. Trump, who once dabbled in theater producing. 'If people love a Broadway show, it's better than if you write a good review. Word of mouth is the No. 1
 thing. And the word of mouth at my rallies is like, "You've got to go see it." And, you know, one person goes and they talk about it to 20 people." <<link>>




DRIVING THE DAY: Trump-Ryan domain.com ... Milwaukee Journal Sentinel p. 1A, above fold, "Ryan support solid at home: But picture changes for speaker at national level," by Craig Gilbert (online: "Ryan support solid at home but national backlash could lurk over stance on Trump"): "Ryan was viewed favorably by 81% of Republican voters in his district and unfavorably by 12% in a late March poll by the Marquette University Law School. ... Trump was viewed favorably by 28% of those voters and unfavorably by 59%. ...

"In a new poll by the Economist/YouGov, Trump is much more popular nationally than Ryan among Republican primary voters, the reverse of the pattern in Wisconsin." <<link>> ... YouGov's Kathy Frankovic, "Nearly two-thirds of Republican primary voters think Ryan should endorse Trump" <<link>>

--@LukeRussert: "Fair to say House #GOP Conference is divided into 3 factions- Always Trump, Sometimes Trump, Never Trump."

--"Trump surges in support, almost even with Clinton in national U.S. poll," by Reuters' Chris Kahn: "As recently as last week, Clinton led Trump by around 13 points in the [Reuters/Ipsos] poll. In the most recent survey, 41 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, and 40 percent backed Trump, with 19 percent not decided on either yet." <<link>>

VEEPSTAKES - "Donald Trump suggests Jan Brewer is on VP short list," by Arizona Republic's Yvonne Wingett Sanchez: "During an interview Wednesday with Fox News Channel's 'On the Record,' the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said Brewer, who left office in 2015 after serving six years as governor ... 'has been so fantastic. You know I won so big, her territory, and we won so big. And she is a fabulous woman." <<link>>

TURNING BACK THE CLOCK -- MATT LATIMER in Politico, "6 Alternate Realities That Could Have Stopped Trump: If only we could go back in time tweak a few things, the GOP might be on a different path today": "Avert ABC's decision to put Chris Christie in New Hampshire debate ... Keep Ben Carson from running out of clean clothes ... Talk Mitt Romney into the 2015 race ... Stop the [Christie-Obama] 'hug' ... Reverse Jeb Bush's decision not to run for president in 2015 ... Give America's Founders a glimpse of the future." <<link>>

DANA MILBANK, "Sarah Palin, the political mother of Trump": "[T]he likenesses go much deeper, between the candidates themselves and among the followers they've inspired: The attacks on the media. The demonization of a supposed 'establishment.' The huge and sometimes violent crowds. The prominent platforms given both candidates by Fox News. The racist responses among supporters. The paranoia about taking away guns. The suspicion of science. The scapegoating of Muslims. The portrayal of President Obama as something other than American." <<link>> 

MONEY HONEYS - "Unions prepare super PAC to take down Trump," by Brian Mahoney and Ken Vogel: "The super PAC is engineered by top officials at the AFL-CIO and three major public employee unions: the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the American Federation of Teachers; and the National Education Association. [The super PAC is also partnering with Tom Steyer's group, NextGen Climate.] ... Unions may opt in for $1 million ... The PAC's organizers aim to raise about $50 million by soliciting money from unions and liberal donors outside the labor movement. ... The PAC will be led by Paul Tewes." <<link>>

2016 PLAYERS - "Sanders' California director leaves campaign," by Gabe Debenedetti: "Sanders' campaign parted ways with its California state director Michael Ceraso on Wednesday morning, 27 days before the primary in the state that Sanders has repeatedly said is crucial to his effort to capture the Democratic nomination. The surprise move came after a period when Ceraso advocated for a California strategy that involved more investment on field and digital organizing than on television advertising - a staple of Sanders' campaign elsewhere so far." <<link>>

FIRST LOOK - Americans United for Change memo, "Analysis: Supreme Court Obstructionism + Trump Nomination = Good-Bye GOP Senate Majority": "[W]hat should really keep vulnerable Republicans up at night is the finding that 50% of voters say they'd be less likely to vote for a Senator who opposed having confirmation hearings, compared to only 18% who say that the obstructionist stance is the right stance. Swing-state Republican Senators who enable McConnell's nakedly political scheme to hand Trump the appointment might as well start checking the K Street want ads now." <<link>>

HILL DRAMA -- "Harry Reid to Rep. Alan Grayson: 'I want you to lose,'" by Burgess Everett and Seung Min Kim: "Rep. Alan Grayson angrily confronted Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid on Wednesday, disrupting a meeting of the Congressional Progressive Caucus in front of dozens of staffers and members of Congress. ... As each member took a turn to speak to Reid, it was Grayson's turn. He asked Reid if the Nevada senator knows who he is. After Reid answered in the affirmative, Grayson went on the attack. 'Say my name, senator. Say my name,' Grayson told Reid as Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) tried to shut the confrontation down. ... Grayson responded by angrily waving a printout of Reid's searing
 February quote that called on Grayson to drop out of the primary race against Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.). 'Why'd you say that?' Grayson said, insisting Reid's statement was false. Reid calmly faced his inquisitor: 'I want you to lose. It's true.'" <<link>>

VALLEY TALK - "Sources: Feds taking second look at Google search," by Nancy Scola: "Federal Trade Commission officials are asking questions again about whether Google has abused its dominance in the domain.com search market, a sign that the agency may be taking steps to reopen an investigation it closed more than three years ago ... While the inquiry appears to be in the early, information-gathering stage, it signals renewed agency interest in the kind of search case it examined - but ultimately closed without charges - in 2013." <<link>>
