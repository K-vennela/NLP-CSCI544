Can we still use the poll in a release like

"New poll shows Democratic disunity is a myth"

72 percent of Bernie voters will go for Hillary. Only 60 percent of Hillary supporters said they would go for Obama in May 08

Also - this is great to highlight: 80 percent of Democrats are "mostly hopeful" about the party's future, as opposed to Republicans, who are domain.com 55%-43% between "mostly hopeful" and "mostly discouraged" about the future of the Republican Party.

Since there was such a heavy Bernie piece in here let's not touch it.

Just now - feat. Dana Milbank. Talked about a poll that shows party more unified today than it was in 08. Thanks!
