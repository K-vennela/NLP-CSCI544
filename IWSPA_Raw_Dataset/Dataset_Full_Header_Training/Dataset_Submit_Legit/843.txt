We have to change the tone. our direction and framing on Trump and his foreign policy speech should go back to our standard framing on how he is dangerous. Let's stop using the rambling and incoherent frame. Please see how we are to talk about his foreign policy speech below. That means music shouldn't be silly but ominous, and focus should be on contradictions, problems with what he's saying, less focus on style.

As he's done throughout his campaign, Dangerous Donald Trump is proving that on foreign policy, he lacks the judgment, experience, and temperament to be our next commander-in-chief. Trump would alienate allies and deal with friend and foe alike with reckless disregard, with poorly conceived ideas that would undermine our national security and make the American people less safe.

Don't take our word for it, see what people are saying about his remarks below:

A Trump-First Foreign Policy
<<<link>>>WALL STREET JOURNAL //
His maiden policy speech on Wednesday, devoted to foreign affairs, earns an "incomplete" at Trump University.
...

The 5,000-word speech lacked specifics by normal political standards, if not his own. The central motif, like all of Mr. Trump's political thought, is that the businessman has the brains and strength to solve a given problem, and everybody else is a pathetic loser, so trust his instincts and temperament.
...

For prepared remarks, or for that matter even an after-dinner talk, Mr. Trump's speech was especially rife with contradictions. He said the conduct of foreign policy must be "more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything." He also said the conduct of foreign policy must be "disciplined, deliberate and consistent."
...
Mr. Trump isn't known for close readings of his briefing books, if such documents exist, and deep policy knowledge is obviously not the source of his political appeal. But Americans typically prefer Presidents who are conversant about the world's biggest problems beyond a sound bite or two...

Mr. Trump promised to "win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become President." He won't become the GOP nominee much less President if voters don't trust him with nuclear weapons...

Donald Trump's Strange Worldview
<<<link>>>NEW YORK TIMES // THE EDITORIAL BOARD
...
No one's fears are likely to be allayed by this speech, which was clearly worked up by his new campaign advisers and read from a teleprompter. It did not domain.com much grasp of the complexity of the world, understanding of the balance or exercise of power, or even a careful reading of history.
...

Mr. Trump repeatedly states outright falsehoods, often based on wrong assumptions. He's been refuted before on his claim that the Islamic State is making "millions of dollars a week" by selling Libyan oil. There is zero evidence of that. The nuclear deal with the United States and other major powers has not made Iran a "great power," nor has Tehran violated the conditions of that pact, as Mr. Trump has said.

Mr. Trump says he knows how to negotiate, and to him that seems to mean putting forward maximal positions that he can then walk back. That won't work in foreign policy. Mr. Trump did not display any willingness to learn or to correct his past errors. For someone who claims he is ready to lead the free world, that is inexcusable.

Trump's unreal foreign policy: Our view
<<<link>>>USA TODAY // EDITORIAL BOARD
As anyone who watches reality television knows, the genre might be entertaining, but its correlation to actual reality is tenuous.

Which is a good place to start with the  much-awaited foreign policy speech delivered Wednesday in Washington by presidential candidate Donald Trump.

As with The Apprentice, the show that helped him become a household name, the Republican front-runner sought to provide appealing fare for a certain class of people. In this case, the primary audience was voters opposed to trade, resentful of immigrants, distrustful of foreign governments, and wistful for a time when America wielded more power in a simpler world.

In reaching out to this group, Trump vividly portrayed a world that does not exist: America's allies would be more respectful after being lectured to, while its enemies would be dealt with by bluster. China would fall into line after enduring unspecified economic pressure. And troubled regions of the world would be stabilized through U.S. disengagement.
...

Things might happen that way on TV. But not in reality. Or perhaps we should say real reality.

Donald Trump shows dangerously incoherent foreign policy<<<link>>>
THE SACRAMENTO BEE // THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Then, he gave a rambling, vague and incoherent speech Wednesday full of platitudes and contradictions, and suggested he would undermine international alliances that have helped keep America safe since World War II.

It was billed as a major foreign policy address, but voters looking for reassurances about Trump as commander in chief can't feel that much more comfortable. Our longtime allies certainly won't be confident.
Don't be fooled by Trump's foreign policy speech<<<link>>>
WASHINGTON POST // ANNE APPLEBAUM
If you weren't already convinced that parody is now the central art form of our era, then Donald Trump's grand foreign policy speech yesterday was the proof.
...

The multiple inconsistencies and internal contradictions have already been listed by others. On the one hand, he said that "your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them." On the other hand, he threatened to "walk" if those same friends didn't pony up to his demands. He wants to invest heavily in the military, but he wants to stop using the military. He doesn't want to do "nation-building" but does want to promote "regional stability." There was no sense that he knew what either of those terms actually meant.
...

Anyone who sits down and analyzes the speech from start to finish will, of course, worry about the contradictions, the inconsistencies, the impossible claims, the detachment from reality.

From Donald Trump, a Foreign Policy Speech Heavy on Slogans and Light on Details
<<<link>>>WALL STREET JOURNAL // AARON DAVID MILLER
Those expecting a coherent, well-ordered view of the world and a strategy to match it would have been disappointed listening to Donald Trump's foreign policy address on Wednesday. The speech was a collection of bromides, slogans, aims, and promises wrapped in Mr. Trump's conviction that he can solve America's problems in a cruel and unforgiving world-all without specifying how.
...

Nobody expected great detail on how exactly he would accomplish all of his plans. But in what was billed as a major foreign-policy address, the absence of guidance on how he would achieve his goals was striking. The best he could do about better burden sharing with our NATO allies was to suggest a domain.com to discuss the matter.
...
His implication that only he knows how to fix what ails the republic suggests a self-absorption that goes well beyond the normal ego and narcissism required to run for president. Mr. Trump's preference for celebrity (his) over substance and his reliance on one-liners over serious analysis of complicated problems point up potential for conflict, at minimum, should he win the nation's most-demanding job, a position that requires prudence, curiosity, and a willingness not only to ask questions but also to home in on the right ones.

Trump struggles to explain 'America first' foreign policy<<<link>>>
ASSOCIATED PRESS// LOLITA C. BALDOR AND SAGAR MEGHANI
Donald Trump strained to lay out a clear vision of his "America first" foreign policy on Wednesday, vowing to substitute hard-headed realism for what he called a post-Cold War era replete with U.S. national security failures.

Yet the Republican presidential front-runner outlined no strategy for how he'd make the United States at the same time a "consistent" and "unpredictable" force in the world. And he didn't appear to allay the concerns of U.S. and international critics - Republicans at home as well as Democrats - who see him as domain.com for the responsibilities of commander in chief.
...

Trump also contradicted his own broad-brush approach to foreign policy. He said at one point that the best way to achieve his goals was through "disciplined, deliberate and consistent" policy. Later, however, he exhorted the nation to "be more unpredictable" in how it combats enemies.

Graham tears into Trump's 'pathetic' foreign policy speech
<<<link>>>THE HILL // JESSIE HELLMAN
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) tore into Donald Trump's foreign policy address Wednesday in a series of tweets, saying, "Ronald Reagan must be rolling over in his grave."

The outspoken senator called Trump's speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington pathetic and incoherent.

"Trump speech is pathetic in terms of understanding the role America plays in the world, how to win War on Terror, and threats we face," Graham wrote.

"Trump's FP speech not conservative. It's isolationism surrounded by disconnected thought, demonstrates lack of understanding threats we face."

Awesome. 2 adds from me.

Can we get a Fareed clip talking about Trump's speech? Feel like he's very recognizable

And has there been any discussion on television about how the Republican Party has its highest disapproval in 24 years? I've seen a some print pickup but no TV yet. That could be a good kicker. <<link>>

Thanks guys
