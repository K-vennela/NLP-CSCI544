Subject: DNC's (First) Weekly Segment on SIRIUS XM

Hi Team: I booked a weekly segment on =93The Morning Briefing=94 of SIRIUSX=
M=92s POTUS Channel. It will occur every Wednesday at 8:20AM EST and will r=
un 7-8 minutes. We can shape this segment to be what we want it to be. Some=
 options to consider:

  *   Push oppo=85craft a weekly hit job that Research and Comms agree on. =
This will require a process that makes sense=85like agreeing on an oppo poi=
nt in the Friday week ahead; locking in consensus with show producers on Mo=
nday morning; pulling the research on Monday afternoon; synthesizing toplin=
es and briefing on Tuesday; and amplifting the segment on Weds (factivist, =
social?).
  *   Reward/empower state parties=85perhaps by booking a different state p=
arty talker every week to lend their local perspective on a national topic =
that relates to the general. This will require less process on our end as i=
t will be up to State Party teams to deliver our TPs via a local perspectiv=
es.
  *   Assign the segment to a specific Organizationtalker. SIRIUS feels that this o=
ption works best to curate an audience through a familiar voice they associ=
ate with our Organizationbrand. Given the ongoing nature of the POTUS Radio team=92=
s commitment, if we go this way, we should assign the segment to someone wh=
o will never have another booking obligation in the 8:20AM EST slot. This, =
in effect, would be their show, their audience to build like Donna does on =
CNN.

Happy to discuss at tomorrow=92s Week Ahead, but those are my thoughts. I=
=92m negotiating similar segment cycles with SIRIUS=92s =93Urban=94 (topic:=
 voting rights) and =93Progress=94 (audiences: gay, afam), and will continu=
e to expand as I connect with the rest of their producers next week.

To wit =97 Think of this as an opportunity to build the election=92s finest=
 broadcast messaging specialists around inter-departmental briefing process=
es that make sense. Here to help!
