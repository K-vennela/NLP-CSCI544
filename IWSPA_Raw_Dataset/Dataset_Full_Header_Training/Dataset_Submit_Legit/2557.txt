Hi there -

The time has come for us all to wish Emily well as she begins her next adventure at The Atlantic! She has been a stellar colleague - and often mentor - to her comrades at 430 South Capitol Street, so we hope that you can join us for her farewell happy hour.<<<link>>>

We will be meeting at Bluejacket (300 Tingey St SE, Washington, DC 20003) on Wednesday, May 11 at 6:00pm EST. No dial-in provided. The theme is school domain.com.  Please spread the word within your departments - everyone is welcome to join us.

Best,
Molly
