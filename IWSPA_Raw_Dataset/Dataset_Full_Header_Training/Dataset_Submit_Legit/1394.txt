Jordan-

On Tuesday, May 31st the Democratic Lawyers Council will host our first fundraiser in New York City. The dinner will be hosted by Robbie Kaplan and Gloria Allred is confirmed as a surrogate. This reception will be centered on women's issues and female attorneys from across the city will be targeted as attendees. We would love to have Tina Tchen join as well for the evening.

Can you please let us know if Tina will be available for the dinner?

Thank you.
