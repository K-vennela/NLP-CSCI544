Wasserman Schultz Statement on Rep. Mark Takai=92s Decision Not to Seek Re-=
election

Washington, DC =96 U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-23) issued the fo=
llowing statement tonight after Rep. Mark Takai (HI-01) announced he will n=
ot seek re-election to the U.S. House of Representatives:

=93My heart is in Hawaii tonight with my colleague and friend, Rep. Mark Ta=
kai and his family, as he continues his ongoing battle with cancer. Mark=92=
s career, marked by bravery in our armed forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom =
and distinguished service in both the Hawaii legislature and U.S. House of =
Representatives, is entering a new phase, as he makes the decision not to s=
eek re-election. As a breast cancer survivor, I know that this battle can b=
e difficult =96 but Mark=92s strength, and the enduring love and support of=
 his wife Sami, his family and friends, and the people of Hawaii, will lift=
 him in this battle. It has been a privilege to get to know him and to serv=
e with him.=94
