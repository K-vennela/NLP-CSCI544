Drug costs increased 15.8 percent in the commercial insurance market last year, and Democrats come out in support of Medicare's embattled Part B demo. But first: Who's setting policy if Donald Trump is president?

WHO SETS THE HEALTH CARE AGENDA IN A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? - If Donald Trump ultimately becomes president, he would need to fill thousands of jobs with civil servants who understand how the massive government bureaucracy functions. But many policy experts who have served in past Republican administrations, and who would appear poised to rejoin the federal government if their party prevails in November, don't want anything to do with a Trump presidency - and that reticence extends to some health care wonks.

"I would never serve in a Trump administration," said James Capretta, who oversaw health care programs at the Office of Management and Budget under George W. Bush. "The person at the top is domain.com for the presidency."

- The uphill climb to attract talent. Lanhee Chen, who served as Mitt Romney's 2015 policy director and advised Marco Rubio this year, declined comment when asked about his willingness to serve Trump. But he did domain.com the brash businessman faces an uphill climb attracting top-tier talent.

"My view is it would be very challenging for a lot of mainstream policy folks to envision working in an administration for somebody who has said some of the things Trump has said during the campaign," Chen said.

SCOOPLET: HOUSE DEMS BACK WHITE HOUSE ON DRUG PLAN - A group of House Democrats is defending the Obama administration's Part B demonstration project in the face of opposition to the project on the part of drug makers, doctors, Republicans and some patient groups.

"We believe this proposal will not only help to fix the current and flawed status quo but will also help combat the increasingly unaffordable prices that drug companies are charging for their products," the 19 Democrats wrote in a letter to CMS that was to be released later today.

FIRST IN PULSE: PATIENT GROUPS FOCUS COMPLAINTS ON PHASE 2 OF PART B DEMO - More than 40 groups, led by the Partnership to Improve Patient Care, are sending a letter to CMS acting administrator Andy Slavitt today with fresh concerns over the agency's planned Part B demonstration project.

While most criticism of the Part B demo has centered on Medicare's proposed changes to lower its add-on payment for drugs, the patient groups say that phase 2 of the proposal - which would introduce new payment pilots that draw on comparative-effectiveness research - would hurt patients, too.

For instance, the groups take issue with CMS's plan to draw on recommendations from ICER - which the groups contend is led by a governing board that "consists mainly of payers, with no representation from patients or people with disabilities."

"While no doubt a well-intentioned effort to advance value-driven health care, the approach it takes would represent a major step back for patients and people with disabilities," the organizations write.

ICYMI: CMS ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO MARKETPLACES - The agency on Friday said it's making a series of requested changes intended to stabilize the Obamacare exchanges and strengthen competition.

Under Friday's rule, CMS says it's ... 

. Helping the co-ops get new funding. CMS is revising some of the governance rules in order to allow the 11 remaining co-op plans to attract additional investors. More for Pros.

. Tightening special enrollment periods. Individuals who want to sign up outside of the standard enrollment window because of a "permanent move" will need to show they've had coverage for at least one day in the previous two months in order to qualify.

. Giving states more flexibility. CMS is encouraging states to develop their own solutions for helping small health plans that have been hit with significant risk adjustment assessments. More for Pros.

 - What insurers are saying: Necessary fix. Payers specifically hailed the changes to the special enrollment period as a necessary fix, citing their ongoing concern that the rules around special enrollments have been too lax and allowed for too many free riders.

"Linking special enrollment periods for a permanent move to prior coverage is an important step towards helping stabilize the market and will also encourage people to stay continuously covered, so they can get the coordinated care and preventive services they need," Alissa Fox of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said in a statement. "We will continue to work on additional measures to stabilize the marketplace."

"This is progress," AHIP added in a statement. "Having clear guidelines around special enrollment periods is critical to delivering affordable coverage for all consumers."

BLACKS SEE MAJOR GAINS IN LIFE EXPECTANCY - "Blacks are still at a major health disadvantage compared with whites," Sabrina Tavernese writes in a front-page New York Times story today. "But evidence of black gains has been building and has helped push up the ultimate measure - life expectancy."

Tavernese rounds up a series of recent federal reports and shows how the gap is closing - partly because of improvements in care, and partly because life expectancy for whites has fallen in the wake of the opioid crisis and other problems.

CONFESSIONS OF AN EX-REGULATOR ON HOW GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK - When crafting major reforms like meaningful use, "regulators really, really, really want to get it right," Farzad Mostashari said on POLITICO's "Pulse Check" podcast last week, but they end up being too cautious and conciliatory. And that's bad for health care, he argues, because it protects underperformers and lets them stick around. The story for Pros.

** A message from Stop CMS Cuts: Medicare has proposed a new payment "model" for Part B drugs that is really an experiment that will take clinical decision making out of the hands of physicians by allowing government bureaucrats to influence decisions for seniors. In a cookie-cutter approach, Medicare wants to sway treatment options based solely on cost and not on the patient's individual clinical needs. Rather than testing payment changes in a limited, controlled model, this is a mandatory, national experiment without patient safeguards and disclosures. Decisions about a patient's care should be made by physicians in collaboration with patients. Not government regulators. 

Bipartisan lawmakers, patient advocates and providers agree: We must stop Medicare's experiment on seniors. domain.com domain.com to learn more. **
