NEW VIDEO <<<link>>>: Sharron Angle
Accepts Parrot Debate Challenge =E2=80=93 Will Congressman Heck?

When asked by (soon to be) Famous NV Dems Parrots if she will debate
Congressman Heck, Sharron Angle says: =E2=80=9CI would like to=E2=80=A6=E2=
=80=9D

Meanwhile, Congressman Heck is silent

*Watch the Video Here* <<<link>>>

Las Vegas, NV =E2=80=93 Over the weekend, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angl=
e
confirmed to the (soon to be) Famous NV Dems Parrots that she welcomes the
opportunity to debate Congressman Heck, stating, =E2=80=9CI would like to,=
=E2=80=9D when
asked by the Parrots. And from Congressman Heck? Not a squawk.

But maybe the reason Congressman Heck has been too chicken to debate Angle
is the inconvenient truth that it=E2=80=99s hard to find a single issue whe=
re Angle
and the Congressman disagree. Congressman Heck and Sharron Angle are two
birds of the same feather on issue after issue. From wanting to privatize
Social Security, to calling for the repeal of birthright citizenship, to
proposing to eliminate the Department of Education, Sharron Angle and
Congressman Heck share the same reckless Republican agenda.

=E2=80=9CWe thank Sharron Angle for accepting the Parrot debate challenge, =
and
would hope Congressman Heck would do the same,=E2=80=9D said Sarah Zukowski=
,
spokesperson for the Nevada State Democratic Party. =E2=80=9CWhether it=E2=
=80=99s their
anti-immigrant, anti-woman, or anti-senior agendas, a debate will make
clear that on issue after issue, Congressman Heck and Sharron Angle will
side with their Party=E2=80=99s bosses in Washington against Nevadans.=E2=
=80=9D
