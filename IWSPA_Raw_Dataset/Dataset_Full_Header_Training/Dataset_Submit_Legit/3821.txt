ROUNDUP

UPDATE

DONALD TRUMP ROUNDUP

TRUMP MEETS WITH RNC TO PLAN BIG-MONEY STRATEGY: "The fundraising agreement was among the subjects discussed at a Monday meeting at the Republican National Committee's Washington offices between top RNC officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, and senior Trump aides, including campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, senior adviser Paul Manafort and political director Rick Wiley, according to the sources." [Politico, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

TRUMP ACCEPTING BIG-MONEY DONATIONS HE ONCE SAID CORRUPTED POLITICIANS: "Donald Trump, who has spent months decrying politicians who take big money for their campaigns, now says he will accept money from big-dollar donors for the general election. Trump's team announced last week that he will create a fundraising apparatus that will take big checks from the wealthiest donors to fund a campaign that could cost upward of $1 billion, according to Bloomberg." [Vox, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

FORMER 'STOP TRUMP' MEGA DONOR STANLEY HUBBARD JOINS PRO-TRUMP SUPER PAC: "Once a big donor to the anti-Trump movement, billionaire broadcasting executive Stanley Hubbard is now backing the presumptive GOP nominee. Hubbard, a prolific giver to Republican candidates and causes, will join the advisory committee of Great America PAC, a pro-Trump super PAC. During the primary, Hubbard cut a $10,000 check to the Our Principles PAC, a group that was devoted to defeating Trump." [Politico, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

BUT YOU CANNOT SAY MY NAME - GOP ENDORSERS SUPPORT "NOMINEE" NOT "TRUMP": "The trick is not to speak his name. But fortunately for senators in tough, competitive seats, there is another option. You don't have to endorse Trump. You can just support the Nominee of the Party. These are not the same thing at all! They are quite different. The Nominee is everything Trump isn't." [Alexandra Petri, Washington Post, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

KRUGMAN: "TRULY, DONALD TRUMP KNOWS NOTHING": "Truly, Donald Trump knows nothing... He really is frighteningly uninformed; worse, he doesn't appear to know what he doesn't know... Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom, but in this election, one party has largely cornered the market in raw ignorance." [Paul Krugman, New York Times, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

TRUMP SAYS LONDON'S NEW MUSLIM MAYOR COULD BE EXCEPTION TO HIS BAN ON MUSLIMS: "'There will always be exceptions,' Mr. Trump said when asked in an interview on Monday how his proposed ban would affect London's mayor, Sadiq Khan. 'I was happy to see that,' Mr. Trump said of Mr. Khan's election. 'I think it's a very good thing, and I hope he does a very good job because frankly that would be very, very good.'" [New York Times, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

FORMER MEXICAN PRESIDENT VINCENTE FOX BASHES TRUMP IN RANT: "'This is a smart guy who takes advantage of that, the Hugo Chavezs, the Evo Morales, the, so many populists and demagogues that we had in Latin America. The Perons, Evita,' said Fox... 'I'm not gonna pay for that fucking wall and please don't take out the fucking full word,' he said. 'He's crazy. He is crazy.'" [Buzzfeed, 5/9/16<<<link>>#.wupNk2qkN>]

FROM PLAYBOY TO PRESIDENT - TRUMP'S FORMER SEX TALK COMES BACK INTO THE FORE: "'You could've gotten her, right?' Stern asked Trump on-air shortly after Princess Diana's death in 1997. 'You could've nailed her.' 'I think I could have,' Trump said. How about singer Mariah Carey? 'Would you bang her?' Stern asked. Trump replied, 'I would do it without hesitation.' Trump's crude talk on-air with Stern between 1990 and 2015 was part of an image the businessman cultivated as a Manhattan playboy who had so many women that he barely had time to sleep. He was often seen at trendy nightclubs with different women, appeared on the cover of Playboy magazine, wrote in his books about all the women chasing him and publicly boasted about his sex life." [Washington Post, 5/10/16<<<link>>>]

TRUMP DAILY UPDATE

The Trump Campaign Refuted Reports About A Planned Trip To Israel, Russia, And Germany After The Republican Convention. "Donald Trump's presidential campaign has denied a report by the Israeli news outlet Maariv that the candidate was planning to domain.com Israel, Russia and Germany after formally accepting the Republican presidential nomination at the party's convention this July. Despite cancelling a trip to Israel that had been planned for earlier this year, and would have included a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a source close to Trump told Maariv that the candidate had mentioned a post-convention tour overseas in meetings with his advisers. Trump campaign spokewsoman Hope Hicks later told the Washington Examiner that no such trip is being planned." [Washington Examiner, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

May 2016: Trump Drank Diet Coke During An Interview. "Trump also said his work was so 'all-consuming' that he could not have been the libidinous playboy portrayed in the media. 'People may be surprised that my life is much simpler than they thought,' said Trump, with a Diet Coke in a plastic cup on his desk. 'And they may be surprised that my life is much less glamorous than they thought, including every story about a supermodel.'" [Washington Post, 5/10/16<<<link>>>]

Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig are also reported to be devoted Diet Coke drinkers." [Daily Press, 1/26/04]

HEADLINE: "Donald Trump Shares His Opponent-Branding Secrets." [Mark Leibovich, New York Times Magazine, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

Trump On Giving Nicknames To Opponents: "I Feel It, It's An Instinct." "Get used to 'Crooked Hillary,' for better or worse. That's Donald Trump's comic-book villain name for Hillary Clinton. It's gaining traction on Twitter and in other forums across the virtual schoolyard. Soon it will be chanted at Trump's rallies, painted on posters and deployed as a heckling epithet against the probable Democratic nominee. Trump is confident the name will stick, and he's usually right about these things. 'I feel it, it's an instinct,' Trump told me over the phone. He envisions 'Crooked Hillary' as the latest triumph in a series, after 'Lyin' Ted,' 'Liddle Marco' and 'Low Energy Jeb,' the nicknames that he affixed to his vanquished Republican rivals, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. Trump has a knack for coining just the right moniker, the perfectly dismissive and catchy thing. 'It works, it flows,' Trump said, admiring his latest work." [Mark Leibovich, New York Times Magazine, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

Trump Said His Opponents' Nicknames Die Once They Drop Out. "Once an opponent drops out of the race, Trump told me, his or her nickname dies, at least as far as he's concerned. He goes back to using the actual name, although he reserves the right to bring the nickname back if he ever feels disrespected. 'With Jeb, I just said he's a low-energy individual, but I don't mind talking about it now,' Trump said. 'Jeb has said he's not going to the convention. You know, he's just a spoiled guy.'" [Mark Leibovich, New York Times Magazine, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

Trump Specified The Spellings Of His Opponents' Nicknames Mattered For The Branding Effect: "It Matters As To The Look And Feel And Touch." "Like Trump himself, these monikers have a tabloid-ready directness. They can feel almost old-fashioned, like the professional wrestling shows of days gone by. (When Trump kept calling Rubio 'Little Marco,' I kept thinking of 'Little Louie.') No deep thought or nuance or hand-wringing goes into his coinages, which should come as no surprise. As he has demonstrated with his mastery of Twitter, punchiness is crucial to the Trump playbook. Spelling counts, however. It was important that 'Lyin' Ted' be rendered with an apostrophe (no 'G'), and 'Liddle Marco' with D's. 'It matters,' Trump said of the spellings. 'It matters as to the look and feel and touch.'"

Over The Past Three Years, The Trump Foundation Gave Over $150,000 To Columbia Grammar And Preparatory School. "The personal ties between Donald Trump and Jeff Zucker, the chief executive of CNN, extend beyond the reality TV hit they created together into a far more personal realm: the expensive Manhattan private school where they have both sent children, and where Zucker's wife was until recently a member of the board.

"The personal ties between Donald Trump and Jeff Zucker, the chief executive of CNN, extend beyond the reality TV hit they created together into a far more personal realm: the expensive Manhattan private school where they have both sent children, and where Zucker's wife was until recently a member of the board.

Caryn Zucker is listed as a board member for the school in tax documents covering July 2015 through June 2014. Zucker has drawn criticism inside and outside of CNN for the cable channel's coverage of Trump, including charges that CNN has turned its platform over to a demagogue and hasn't been sufficiently skeptical of Trump's routine campaign falsehoods. Zucker has brushed off these charges, saying that it's only natural for a political frontrunner to receive outsize attention. Neither party has referred publicly to this family connection."

*         February 2015: Donald And Melania Trump Attended Columbia Grammar And Preparatory School's Annual domain.com And Took Photos With Caryn Zucker. "In February 2015, five months before Trump announced his candidacy, he and his wife, Melania, posed for a photograph with Caryn at the Upper West Side school's annual domain.com. In a gallery that was initially posted on the photographer's website, Caryn Zucker was the only person Trump was pictured with other than Melania. (After an inquiry to Columbia Prep from BuzzFeed News, the photograph was removed from the photographer's website.) Trump's foundation donated $50,000 to the school that same day. The program from this year's event, which Trump did not attend, lists him as having contributed several items to the school's auction. It is not clear if the $150,000 listed by the Trump Foundation represents cash gifts or the value that the foundation assigned to the donated items, which as the Washington Post has documented is Trump's preferred mode of giving."

TRUMP: "I was thinking of ears, or nose, but that's it, but Megyn came up and we had a great talk, and that was it. I'll do her show. In fact, I've done her show and I loved it, other than I didn't like the way I looked. It was the worst I've ever looked on television. Maybe she set me up.

Foreign Workers

Politifact: "Trump Did Try To Hire Hundreds Of Foreign Workers At His Mar-A-Lago Resort In Palm Beach." "The bottom line: Trump did try to hire hundreds of foreign workers at his Mar-A-Lago resort in Palm Beach, although it's unclear just how many actually took jobs. The workers also weren't necessarily replacing Americans, but filled temporary jobs locals allegedly couldn't do or didn't want... The charge that Trump hires foreign workers revolves around the club seeking H-2B visas for low-skilled workers such as cooks, domain.com staff and housekeepers. H-2B visas are legal - Congress has set the cap at 66,000 per year - and its agricultural counterpart is the H-2A visa. Nationwide for both programs, the vast majority of the workers are young Mexican men, although news reports say Trump sought workers from Europe. Employers argue they need these temporary workers to fill jobs Americans don't want, while critics say the workers can be exploited. Since the visas are tied to a particular job, the foreigners can't simply jump ship for a better paying job at another resort, and unlike Americans, they may be reluctant to raise any complaints with their employers." [Politifact, 5/6/16<<<link>>>]

Since 2010, Trump's Mar-A-Lago Club Only Hired 17 Of 300 U.S. Resident Applicants While Seeking Over 500 Visas For Foreign Workers. "Since 2010, nearly 300 U.S. residents applied or were referred for jobs at Mar-A-Lago, but only 17 were hired, the New York Times reported. Meanwhile, Mar-A-Lago sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. (The visas were also sought at some of his other properties.) We don't know how many people actually used the visas and became employees. A spokesman for the State Department said that information is kept confidential. To obtain the visas, businesses must prove they tried but couldn't fill positions with Americans or legal residents. According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, the resort posted jobs through CareerSource Florida, the local workforce development boards throughout the state. A U.S. Labor Department spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that 93 people applied for 250 seasonal job openings. Four were hired, while 79 didn't answer interview requests or turned down jobs (10 applications were classified with unknown status). Documents the resort later filed with the Labor Department showed that many of the American applicants weren't hired because they didn't meet requirements. Some applicants didn't want to work domain.com shifts, or didn't have enough experience. Many wanted full-time jobs instead of part time, or didn't respond when the resort contacted them. One applicant said they only were applying as a prerequisite to continue getting unemployment. After that process, the Labor Department certified 685 H-2B visas for the Mar-A-Lago Club between 2015 and 2015. News reports suggested Mar-A-Lago did the bare minimum to meet legal requirements to try to domain.com U.S. workers. For example, CNN wrote that job openings were placed in a local newspaper with small circulation for just two days rather than a larger newspaper." [Politifact, 5/6/16<<<link>>>]

Republican Party

Speaker Paul Ryan Said He Was Willing To Step Down As Chairman Of The Republican National Convention If Trump Requested. "Facing a steep challenge as he prepares to meet with Republican leaders about uniting their splintering party, Donald J. Trump on Monday struck a more conciliatory tone about House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, disavowing an ally's call for a primary challenge against Mr. Ryan. Mr. Ryan responded by saying he would step down from his position as chairman of the Republican National Convention in July if that is what the party's presumptive nominee requests. After Mr. Ryan, the nation's highest-ranking elected Republican, said last week that he was 'not ready' to endorse Mr. Trump for president, Mr. Trump on Sunday refused to rule out blocking Mr. Ryan from the convention role. Also on Sunday, one of Mr. Trump's top supporters, the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, called for a primary challenge against Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. But by Monday, both Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan appeared to be backing away slightly from confrontation. Mr. Trump disavowed any hand in Ms. Palin's remarks in a morning interview on CNN with Chris Cuomo. 'She's a terrific person, but she's very much a free agent and I didn't know about this until yesterday,' Mr. Trump said. 'I guess she's been fighting, or she's endorsing somebody that's running against Paul Ryan, and I didn't know about it until yesterday when I read about it.' For his part, Mr. Ryan told a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist, Christian Schneider, 'I'll do whatever he asks me to do,' referring to Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Ryan, Brendan Buck, said he understood Mr. Schneider's report to be accurate." [New York Times, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

Paul Ryan Was Conciliatory Toward Trump And Said A Third-Party Candidacy To Challenge Trump "Would Be A Disaster For Our Party." "Voters in West Virginia and Nebraska will vote in primaries Tuesday. And on Thursday, Trump will meet on Capitol Hill with Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has offered his guarded support, and other GOP leaders in the House and Senate. Ahead of the meeting, Ryan struck a conciliatory tone in interviews with home-state reporters Monday, while defending his stunning decision to refuse to back Trump. Ryan denounced the idea of any Republican launching a third-party or independent candidacy to challenge Trump, telling the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel it 'would be a disaster for our party.' And Ryan said he'd step aside from the House speaker's traditional role as chairman of the Republican National Convention if Trump wants him to, a scenario that Trump left open over the weekend. 'He's the nominee. I'll do whatever he wants in respect to the convention,' Ryan said, insisting that the party must strive to unify, and Trump must lead the effort. Trump himself shrugged off the need for unity. 'I think this is a time for unity. And if there's not going to be unity, I think that's OK, too,' Trump said on Fox Business Network. 'I mean, I'll go out and I think I'll do very well. I think I'm going to win the race either way.' But Ryan's reluctance seemed to embolden others to withhold their support."

HEADLINE: "Congressional Republicans Grapple With New Trump Reality." [Associated Press, 5/10/16<<<link>>>]

Many Republicans In Congress Who Were Facing Re-Election Fights Feared Trump Could Prove A Drag On Their Re-Election Chances. "Congressional Republicans are returning to Capitol Hill to confront an awkward new reality: Donald Trump is their presumptive presidential nominee, but instead of uniting behind him, leading figures like House Speaker Paul Ryan are withholding their support. That highly unusual state of affairs is creating a tricky situation for Republicans in the House and Senate, some of whom fear Trump could prove a drag on their own re-election chances in a year when the GOP is fighting to hang onto its slim Senate majority. 'He's our nominee and there's no reason for me not to be happy about it,' asserted South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who is up for re-election. Asked if he could say he's endorsing Trump, Scott replied: 'I can say that that's a ridiculous question. Obviously if I'm endorsing the nominee I'm endorsing the candidate, right?' Yet the question might not be so ridiculous in an election year where the GOP has been set against itself, perhaps irrevocably, by a divisive billionaire who spent years as a registered Democrat and has managed to insult women, Hispanics, disabled people and others. Many leading Republicans can bring themselves to support Trump only reluctantly, if at all. And that posture is irritating to others in the party who insist that it's time for the GOP to get behind Trump and start preparing for a likely contest against Democrat Hillary Clinton in November."

Republican Platform

Anti-Trump Conservatives Planned To Prevent Trump From Reshaping The Republican Platform To Include Abortion Exceptions And Reversing Party Orthodoxy On Free Trade. "Many Trump opponents see the Republican platform, the party's statement of ideals and policy goals, as a place for a stand in Cleveland. The convention's 2,472 delegates must approve the platform before formally anointing the presidential nominee. All - including those chosen to support Trump - can vote however they want on the platform. Many conservatives say they will use that vote to keep Trump from reshaping GOP dogma against abortion, for free trade and on other issues. While it seems likely Trump would prevail, a showdown could be an embarrassment he'd seek to avoid by not pushing divisive changes. 'If the party walks away from any of its clearly cut social, family values issues, it will be an issue,' said Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council and GOP delegate from Louisiana. 'We're not just going to fall in line because he's the nominee.' Trump has said he would seek to include exceptions for rape and incest to the GOP platform's opposition to abortion. He's also flouted the party platform by repeatedly criticizing trade deals and calling NATO obsolete. 'We'd want to make sure the platform is protected from Donald Trump,' said Rory Cooper, senior adviser for the Never Trump political committee."

Running Mate

HEADLINE: "Trump Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski Will Oversee The Vice-Presidential Search." [Washington Post, 5/10/16<<<link>>>]

Trump Campaign Manager, Corey Lewandowski, Led The Team To Vet Potential Vice-Presidential Candidates. "Lewandowski, Trump's traveling confidant and campaign manager, will be in charge of the team that will survey and vet potential vice-presidential candidates for the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, two top Republicans said. The two Republicans familiar with Lewandowski's responsibilities spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss their private conversations with the Trump campaign, which is planning to ramp up the vice-presidential search in the coming weeks. Lewandowski formally took charge of the hunt for a running mate last week and has since been described inside and outside of the campaign as the point person for all related questions and meetings, the Republicans said.

Support For Trump By Conservative Evangelical Groups Hinged On His Choice Of Running Mate. "Donald Trump's primary run left him with few friends among evangelical leaders, who are now weighing sitting out the general election entirely. But there is one way, they say, to win them back: picking a vice presidential candidate socially conservative enough to compensate for Trump's many heresies. Several of the country's top socially conservative leaders, from Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council to Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America, said Trump's choice of running mate would be among the most important factors in deciding whether to activate their extensive grass-roots networks on on the real-estate billionaire's behalf." [Politico, 5/10/16<<<link>>>]

Evangelical Leaders Said Withholding Their Full Support For Trump Make It Difficult For Him To Win In The General Election. "Certainly, the extent to which Trump needs support from evangelical leaders to win over evangelical voters remains an open question. In the Republican primaries, Trump demonstrated an ability to perform with just about every Republican constituency, beating out Ted Cruz, for example, for the evangelical vote in South Carolina even though Cruz had support from many of the most prominent evangelical leaders in both the state and the country. But in a general election matchup that Trump begins, according to most polls, well behind Clinton, he needs every element of the usual Republican base to turn out. That includes very religious evangelical voters, plenty of whom also tend to be active Republican volunteers - and that subset of the conservative vote has long been hostile to Trump. 'The evangelical activists, those who attend church regularly, were always Trump's weakness,' said Chris Wilson, who headed research and analytics for the Cruz campaign. 'Those are the voters Trump had and continues to have the highest negatives with. It's going to be very difficult to get them excited about his campaign in the fall. No question those make up a core part of any winning Republican coalition.' The movement's leaders are confident that their endorsements and their networks still matter."

Trump Campaign Senior Aides Met With RNC Officials About A Joint Fundraising Agreement And National Committee Resources. "Donald Trump's campaign is hashing out the details of an agreement with Republican Party leaders that could allow the presumptive GOP presidential nominee to raise six-figure checks for his presidential campaign, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations tell POLITICO. The fundraising agreement was among the subjects discussed at a Monday meeting at the Republican National Committee's Washington offices between top RNC officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, and senior Trump aides, including campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, senior adviser Paul Manafort and political director Rick Wiley, according to the sources. The talks represent the first formal steps towards a merger between the official apparatus of the Republican Party and a candidate who many party leaders scorned until recently, and about whom there remains deep leeriness in some Republican quarters." [Politico, 5/10/16<<<link>>#ixzz48Gajbb7x>]

The Currently Planned Joint Fundraising Agreement Between The RNC And Trump Campaign Included Between Four And 12 State Committees. "Early in the election cycle, the talk among GOP state party officials was of a joint fundraising committee that could include all 50 states and six territories, allowing maximum donations of about $1 million per person, according to one state party chairman. But those talks quieted as Trump's surprising rise threw the GOP primary into chaos, said the chairman. Sources with knowledge of the RNC's current plans said its joint fundraising arrangement would include between four and 12 state committees, which could allow the committee to accept checks ranging from $78,800 and $158,000. The joint committee could help Trump's campaign as well as the RNC, which has struggled to keep its finances intact. The committee ended March with just $16 million on hand and nearly $2 million in outstanding debt. Taken together, the bank account is a fraction of where the committee had been at similar points in 2015 and 2012. Many Republican state party chairs, who depend on the RNC to fund a get-out-the-vote program, are anxious to see Trump and the committee form an agreement."

"Mr. Trump, who by the end of March had spent around $40 million of his fortune on the primaries, has said that he may need as much as $1.5 billion for the fall campaign, but that he will seek to raise it from donors rather than continue to self-finance. But Mr. Trump has no fund-raising apparatus to resort to, no network of prolific bundlers to call upon, and little known experience with the type of marathon, one-on-one serial salesmanship and solicitousness that raising so much money is likely to require - even if individuals can contribute up to the current domain.com of $334,000 at a time to the party.

"While Mr. Trump's continued feud with the Republican establishment was likely to cheer his supporters, his intense need for money to run his general election campaign suggests the degree to which he will rely heavily on the party's existing infrastructure. Underscoring the urgency with which Mr. Trump and Republicans will need to increase their fund-raising, some of the party's allies who spent enormous sums in the 2015 election now appear likely to stay on the sidelines in the presidential race - including the vast Koch brothers network, which had pledged to spend nearly $900 million in 2016.

Trump Predicted He Would Raise $1 Billion For The General Election: "As Soon As There's Unity" Fundraising Is "Going To Very Easy To Do." "Republican Party officials have pressed Mr. Trump to sign a joint fund-raising agreement, which would allow him to raise money for the national committee and for his own campaign simultaneously. That, in turn, would also give Mr. Trump a defensible answer for why, after months of railing against Wall Street executives and special interests, he recently turned to a former Goldman Sachs executive, Steven Mnuchin, to corral large checks for his campaign. Both Mr. Trump's aides and party officials were caught by surprise by the abrupt end of the primary contest last week, when Mr. Trump carried Indiana, prompting Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio to withdraw from the race. But the two sides have hurried to wrap up a joint fund-raising agreement, and one is close to being signed, according to people close to the national committee who were not authorized to speak publicly. 'As soon as there's unity, it's going to be very easy to do,' Mr. Trump said in an interview Monday, adding that he still planned to write checks for his campaign. 'I think we'll raise $1 billion,' he said. Under a joint fund-raising agreement, Mr. Trump and the party would most likely be able to raise even more than the current individual domain.com.

"There's a lot of chatter out there to the effect that Donald Trump is shifting his stances on taxing the rich and on the minimum wage. He's moderating his positions for the general election! He's going to get to Hillary Clinton's left on economic issues! The only problem with this reading - which is based largely on what Trump said on the Sunday shows yesterday - is that it didn't actually happen. The only way to conclude that he's actually shifting his positions in any real sense is to treat the idea of having a 'position' as if it's utterly meaningless. First, the minimum wage. On ABC's This Week, Trump said that 'I am looking at it and I haven't decided in terms of numbers,' adding that 'people have to get more.' Asked whether this was a 'change,' Trump said, 'well, sure, it's a change.' But in the context of the policy debate, these phrases mean exactly nothing. Trump is saying generally that people's wages have to rise, not that he intends to work with Congress to raise the federal minimum wage. When Trump says this is a 'change,' the most plausible reading is that this is a change from his general statement during the primaries that wages are 'too high.' In fact, later in the ABC interview, he says that his 'real' rise in the minimum wage will result from his success in bringing 'companies back into this country,' presumably due to his trade wizardry and ultra-tough busting of CEO heads. When he says wages have to go up, he means this is his general goal, and that he'll realize it not with a minimum wage hike, but by making the country filthy rich again."

When Trump says this is a 'change,' the most plausible reading is that this is a change from his general statement during the primaries that wages are 'too high.' In fact, later in the ABC interview, he says that his 'real' rise in the minimum wage will result from his success in bringing 'companies back into this country,' presumably due to his trade wizardry and ultra-tough busting of CEO heads. When he says wages have to go up, he means this is his general goal, and that he'll realize it not with a minimum wage hike, but by making the country filthy rich again."

Washington Post's Sargent: "Trump Hedged On The Core Point Of Whether He Actually Thinks The Wealthy Should Bear A Larger Tax Burden Than They Do Now. Given That His Plan Cuts Their Taxes Dramatically, This Supposed 'Openness' To A Shift Is Meaningless." "There's a lot of chatter out there to the effect that Donald Trump is shifting his stances on taxing the rich and on the minimum wage. He's moderating his positions for the general election! He's going to get to Hillary Clinton's left on economic issues! The only problem with this reading - which is based largely on what Trump said on the Sunday shows yesterday - is that it didn't actually happen. The only way to conclude that he's actually shifting his positions in any real sense is to treat the idea of having a 'position' as if it's utterly meaningless... Now, taxes on the rich. On ABC's This Week, Trump repeatedly said his tax plan - which delivers a massive windfall to the wealthy - would ultimately be 'negotiated' with Congress. After that negotiation, Trump said, taxes on the wealthy will 'go up a little bit,' adding: 'by the time it's negotiated, they'll go up.' Pressed on whether Trump actively wants taxes on rich people like himself to go up, he said that the 'wealthy are willing to pay more,' and that 'I have a feeling we may pay some more.' This shouldn't need to be said, but that isn't actually a position. Taken on its own terms, it is a declaration about what the wealthy want to do of their own accord, and merely a 'feeling' that something 'may' happen in terms of policy to make it so. Indeed, on NBC's Meet the Press, Trump further clarified that when he said businesses may pay more after negotiations with Congress, he really meant that 'they might have to pay a little bit more than my proposal' (emphasis mine). That could easily mean that in the end, businesses may get less of a tax cut than he has proposed for them...On taxes, in both interviews, Trump hedged on the core point of whether he actually thinks the wealthy should bear a larger tax burden than they do now. Given that his plan cuts their taxes dramatically, this supposed 'openness' to a shift is meaningless." [Greg Sargent, Washington Post, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

HEADLINE: "Trump's Tough Talk On Hedge-Fund Taxes Doesn't Match His Plan." [Bloomberg, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

Despite His Criticism Of Hedge Fund Managers, Trump's Tax Proposal Would Lower Their Tax Rates From 23.8 To 15 Percent. "Donald Trump said 'hedge fund guys are getting away with murder' when he called for ending a lucrative tax advantage for investment managers, but his published tax plan would give them an even bigger break. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has called for abolishing the special tax treatment that applies to 'carried interest,' the share of investment funds' profits that are paid to fund managers. Currently, carried interest is treated as capital-gains income, which makes it eligible for a tax rate as low as 23.8 percent -- much lower than the current top individual income tax rate of 39.6 percent. But the plan published on Trump's website would also create an entirely new tax rate -- just 15 percent -- for individuals who get income from business partnerships. That category includes most managers at hedge funds, private-equity funds and venture capital funds. In other words, if Trump's proposals came to pass, many investment managers' tax rates would go from 23.8 percent to 15 percent." [Bloomberg, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

Urban-Brooking Tax Policy Center: Under Trump's Tax Plan "Carried Interest Would Be Taxed At A Much Lower Rate Than Under Current Law." "Some analysts have pointed out previously that the plan on Trump's website would actually domain.com investment managers. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center found that under Trump's plan, 'carried interest would be taxed at a much lower rate than under current law.' Alan Viard, a tax policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of Trump's proposal: 'It's clearly a tax-rate cut for private equity, hedge funds and venture capital.' Trump's 15 percent rate would apply to so-called 'pass-through' business structures, including partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships. For tax purposes, such businesses pass their earnings through to their owners, who then pay tax at rates that reach 39.6 percent under current law. Saying the current system 'stifles small businesses,' the campaign has pitched its 15 percent rate as a boon for them. Trump also has proposed a top income tax rate of 15 percent for large corporations, which currently are subject to a top statutory rate of 35 percent. And he has called for cutting individual income-tax rates across the board as well, taking the top rate from 39.6 to 25 percent." [Bloomberg, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

Trump Said He Would Try To Persuade Congressional Democrats To Lower Taxes On High-Income Households In Exchange For Unrelated Policy Concessions. "On tax policy, Mr. Trump said that as president he would seek to persuade congressional Democrats to lower taxes on high-income households by trading on completely unrelated and unspecified policy issues.

Trump Said It Was "Always Possible To Change" His Tax Plan: "I Believe In Flexibility And Remaining Flexible." "On tax policy, Mr. Trump said that as president he would seek to persuade congressional Democrats to lower taxes on high-income households by trading on completely unrelated and unspecified policy issues. 'There will be a give and take. They're going to want other things having nothing to do with this,' Mr. Trump said. 'It's one very big, very complex proposal, into a negotiation.' He said he was also open to changing his tax plan unveiled last year, which proposed lowering tax rates, pushing 33 million households off the income-tax rolls and, according to an analysis, reducing federal revenue by nearly $10 trillion over the next decade. It's 'always possible to change,' Mr. Trump said. 'I always believe in flexibility and remaining flexible.' Mr. Trump spoke after weekend TV appearances in which he said taxes on high-income households would go up, then later said they would rise only in comparison with his own tax-cutting proposal. His comments left some Republican tax experts trying to decipher what the party's 2015 standard-bearer believes on a central GOP issue." [Wall Street Journal, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

Trump: "My Core Beliefs Are I Want A Major Tax Cut." "'My core beliefs are I want a major tax cut,' Mr. Trump said in the interview. 'And I'm only being honest with people. You can't just say this is what my plan will be. You have to negotiate this with many other people, and those many other people are congressmen and senators, etc., and everybody knows that you have to do that.' Aides to the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, said Monday that voters should look past Mr. Trump's imprecise language and instead focus on his actual plan, which he said Sunday was his 'optimum' policy. The tax plan is the Republican's most specific economic policy, said Clinton policy adviser Jake Sullivan, and Democrats will hold him to it." [Wall Street Journal, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]

Trump Admitted There Was A Contradiction Between His Calls To Reduce Tax Loopholes For The Rich, And His Actual Tax Proposal That Would Cut Taxes For Hedge Fund Managers. "Mr. Trump's plan calls for 'reducing or eliminating most deductions and loopholes available to the very rich.' Asked to be specific, Mr. Trump cited carried interest, the tax provision that lets some investment professionals pay lower capital-gains rates for managing other people's money. But under his plan, the 15% tax rate on business income would be lower than the 20% tax rate on capital gains. Investment managers would no longer need carried interest because they would rather be compensated in lower-taxed fees. Asked to explain the contradiction, Mr. Trump said, 'You're right, depending on what the final deal is. But what I'm going to do and what my priority is going to be is business and middle income.'"

Chief Investment Officer At Cumberland Advisors, David Kotok, Criticized Trump's Comments On The Federal Government Printing Money To Pay Back Debt: "It's A Stupid Idea. You Don't Discharge Debt, Especially U.S. Dollar Debt, By Printing Money. You Do Print Money To Create Liquidity For Banking Systems In Trouble, But You Don't Print Money To Cheapen Your Debt Which Is The Reserve Currency Of The World." "That comment - that the U.S. can simply pay back its trillions of dollars in debt by printing a ton more money - drove Wall Street crazy again and prompted a conference call from top Democrats to rip Trump as completely unglued on the economy... 'If there is ever an example of how dumb it is to print money to handle debt, I'm in a country which has had to learn that the hard way more than once,' said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, speaking from a conference in Argentina. 'It's a stupid idea. You don't discharge debt, especially U.S. dollar debt, by printing money. You do print money to create liquidity for banking systems in trouble, but you don't print money to cheapen your debt which is the reserve currency of the world.' Other Wall Street analysts said while the basic concepts Trump highlighted - buybacks and money printing - are common, the fact that they came from a presidential candidate was shocking. 'We've basically renegotiated existing debt in the past and we certainly do print money,' said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital. 'These concepts are far from odd. But to say them as a presidential candidate is what is so striking to me and frightening. For a president to say these kinds of things publicly would have the opposite effect you would want in that they would put the economy into recession.'" [Politico, 5/10/16<<<link>>>]

Conservative Republicans Criticized Trump For Trying To Influence Policy At The Federal Reserve, Which Is Supposed To Operate Independent Of Political Pressure. "Some conservative Republicans also reacted sharply to Trump's comments, which lie far outside the mainstream of GOP economic policy. Generally, Republicans have favored attacking the debt through spending cuts and faster economic growth rather than manipulating it through buybacks, creditor negotiations or money creation. These people also criticized Trump for appearing to try and influence policy at the Federal Reserve, which is supposed to operate independent of political pressure from the White House or Congress. 'This is yet another big misstep. What he is implying is the era of Fed independence is over,' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former official under President George W. Bush. 'I no longer know what Trump does and doesn't know about managing the debt, but I'm pretty sure I don't trust his judgment. I also worry about the international community watching this daily. They have reason to be nervous about him.'" [Politico, 5/10/16<<<link>>>]

Trump Said Taxes Under His Administration Would Go Up For The Wealthiest Americans, Despite Advocating For The Bush Tax Cuts In The 2000s And Proposing A Tax Plan In 2015 That Would Cut Taxes For Top Earners. "On Sunday, Donald Trump said that under his administration, taxes probably will go up for the wealthiest Americans, in contradiction of his proposed tax plan. On Monday, he clarified that he meant his proposed tax cut, after negotiation with Congress, might just become a smaller tax cut. Trump's inconsistency on the issue of taxes extends back 30 years. In the early 1990s, Trump criticized Reagan-era tax cuts for those in the top tax bracket, saying they removed any incentive for wealthy people to invest. At the end of the '90s, Trump was saying taxes needed to be increased to pay down the national debt and for universal health care. In the 2000s, Trump advocated for the Bush-era tax cuts. Last year, he proposed a plan that would dramatically cut taxes for top earners." [BuzzFeed, 5/9/16<<<link>>#.inDpznp9JB>]

Women

HEADLINE: "From Playboy To President? Trump's Past Crude Sex Talk Collides With His White House Bid." [Washington Post, 5/10/16<<<link>>>]

In The 1990s And Early 2000s, Trump Used His Playboy Reputation And Public Boasting About His Sex Life To Build His Brand. "Trump's crude talk on-air with Stern between 1990 and 2015 was part of an image he cultivated as a Manhattan playboy who had so many women that he barely had time to sleep. He was often seen at trendy nightclubs with different women, appeared on the cover of Playboy magazine, wrote in his books about all the women chasing him and publicly boasted about his sex life. That reputation was useful as Trump, in his 40s and 50s, built a brand designed to equate his name with success and the high life. But it is problematic as Trump, 69, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, tries to wash away his tabloid past and fashion a more dignified persona - as a potential commander in chief and leader of the free world." [Washington Post, 5/10/16<<<link>>>]

Trump Said The Media Narrative Of His Playboy Lifestyle Was "Overblown" And That His "Life Is Much Less Glamorous Than They Thought, Including Every Story About A Supermodel." "Trump also said his work was so 'all-consuming' that he could not have been the libidinous playboy portrayed in the media. 'People may be surprised that my life is much simpler than they thought,' said Trump, with a Diet Coke in a plastic cup on his desk. 'And they may be surprised that my life is much less glamorous than they thought, including every story about a supermodel.' Trump said the media coverage of his personal life was 'overblown.'

The BuzzFeed list included one clip in which Trump said: 'Her boob job is terrible. They look like two light posts coming out of a body.' In another clip, Trump said, 'A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10.' Stern had a huge national audience and made a name for himself with off-color questions, like this one, to Trump: 'Is oral sex important to you? Man to man, and I've had this discussion with many men.' Trump responded, 'No, it's not important to me.' In his recent interview with The Washington Post, Trump said he and Stern 'had great moments' on the air, but he acknowledged he would not have said certain things had he known then that he would eventually be running for office. 'Or I wouldn't have gone on the show because that is the easier way of doing it,' Trump said. Trump said Stern is a good friend, 'a really good guy and a very different guy when you take the radio microphone away.' Stern declined to comment." [Washington Post, 5/10/16<<<link>>>]
