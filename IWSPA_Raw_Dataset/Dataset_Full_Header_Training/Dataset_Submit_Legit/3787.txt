I'm only available for 12:30-1:30. We have a bunch of ideas but they're not very well organized yet.

Matt/Lauren are you guys still brainstorming with your teams or has that been completed?

The last time we got all of the departments together on this, we didn't make much progress. I'd rather meet when we have our ducks in a row a little better. a more detailed outline of what we want to do than just have everyone meet for the sake of meeting

Per User, we are doing a Press brainstorm first at 3:30pm on Thursday. Based on what comes out of that, we can meet.
