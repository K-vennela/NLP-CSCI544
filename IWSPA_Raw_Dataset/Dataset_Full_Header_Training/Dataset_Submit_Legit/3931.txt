*         EgyptAir, terror possible, reminder of loss in battle against terror, what is your message / what is response?

o   It does appear that it was an act of terrorism, investigation will have to determine how

o   Shines a bright light on threats we face from terror groups

o   Reinforces need for smart, steady, American leadership, working with allies/partners

o   We have to have a concerted effort, bring domestic resources, airport security, world depends upon air travel

o   Fight against ISIS in Syria/Iraq needs to be intensified, along line of plan I've been outlining for months

*         Criticism that threat is growing under Obama, are things worse now?

o   We have to take historic view, we've been able to defeat al Qaeda in large measure, which was responsible for worst attacks

o   We have to deal with threats as they come, but we've succeeded in making it harder for them to operate from stronghold

o   We need to work closely with Europe and convince them to do more, we were in constant dialogue with them while I was SecState

o   We have to put everything we can toward goal of defeating ISIS

*         How do you fight perception that we're weak?

o   Trump says a lot of things that are provocative, that make important task of defeating terrorism more difficult, like his plan to bar all Muslims, some of whom are among our strongest allies in this fight

*         But Trump message resonates, Comey said he can't vet

o   He has said all Muslims-Nobel prize winners, entertainers, sports stars, new London mayor

o   Trump said he'd make an exception-whole approach is wrongheaded

o   Trump has attacked our ally, Great Britain, praised NK dictator, said we should pull out of NATO, said more countries should have nukes

o   Unpredictable and dangerous rhetoric

o   We have been effective in taking out ISIS leadership, going after funding, we've taken back Ramadi

*         Do you think Trump is qualified to be president

o   No I do not. [first time she's said it. this was 100% preplanned and came off as such]

o   Whether it is [all FP rhetoric], his statements are dangerous and so are the consequences of his policies.

o   We have seen how Trump is essentially being used as a recruiter for the cause of terrorism

o   This isn't just him saying things off the cuff, it's a pattern that has gone on for months

o   I was part of OBL raid decision-those decisions had to be carefully parsed

o   We need steadiness as well as strength and smarts

*         Trump couldn't make OBL raid decision?

o   He could, but perhaps on evidence that wasn't clear

*         If you're the nominee

o   It's done, there's no way I won't be

o   [on NV] what I saw was disturbing

o   I'm confident we'll be unified from experience, I went all the way back in '08

o   Just as I did with Obama, when it was much closer, I withdrew and endorsed Obama

o   Our differences pale in comparison to nominee of Republican party

*         Why don't you reach out directly to Sanders, he says it's your job to do the unification?

o   I've said many times to his supporters what I just said to you

o   I will do my part, but Sanders needs to do his part

o   We went to Unity NH together, spoke together, reached out to each other's supporters

o   Sanders said the other day he'd do everything possible to defeat Trump

o   The threat he poses is so dramatic to our democracy, our economy

*         Direct conversations with Sanders?

o   He knows what I'm saying

*         Sanders VP, any chance?

o   I'm not going to get into that, that's something down the road

o   I think what brings us together is Trump

o   [is he in consideration] I'm not going to answer that

*         Trump said he'd get heavily personal with you and your husband, you said you wouldn't go there, but that's what Jeb Bush, others said

o   Not concerned, people can judge his campaign for what it is

o   I'm not running against him so much as for the future of this country

o   I'm confident we'll lay out my record of accomplishments, my ideas, my vision, that's the campaign I intend to run

*         But Trump way is working, took out field

o   I've gotten 2 million votes

o   His opponents couldn't criticize him because they agreed with him on most issues-they all want to criminalize abortion

o   If you pick a fight with a bully, you'll be pulled down to their level

o   [but at some point you have to stand up to a bully] that's what this campaign is doing

o   It's not about me, it's about what he says about other people-women, immigrants, muslims, a reporter with disabilities

o   I'm going after him on divisive and dangerous statements

*         Do you ever feel compelled to defend your honor or that of your husband?

o   No, that's exactly what he's fishing for

*         Future of party, where does it end up?

o   We are going to come together

o   Doesn't mean we won't have vigorous discussion and debate

o   We'll have a great convention in Philadelphia and then take the case to Nov

o   Trump fails all three tests presidents need to pass

*         When you started this campaign, you talked about grandchild and mother. What do you think when you think about your inspiration, you've never faced an opponent like Trump, what advice?

o   Everyone gets knocked around, the real test is getting back up

o   Mother's life much harder than mine

o   At stake is are we going to reconfirm the promise of America
