Thanks Garret, Aaron, send us details on the event, who the audience is etc and we'll review whether it makes sense to add press.

Hi Garret,

Thanks so much for this. Would you folks like this to be open or closed press? For your awareness, the standard for these events is closed press, but we can have open if we wish.

Many thanks,

Aaron

Hi Garret,

After conferring with Marilyn and KJ, attached is the event memo that CE would like to put forward to be reviewed by the Chair. It is the same one that Marilyn approved and we have already submitted.

Marilyn can confirm if needed.

I apologize for the confusion and thank you for all your help and understanding.
