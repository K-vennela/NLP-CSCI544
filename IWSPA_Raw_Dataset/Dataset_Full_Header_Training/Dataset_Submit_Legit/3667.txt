Pelosi Remarks at Press Availability Following

Meeting on Department of Labor Conflict of Interest Rule

Washington, D.C. =96 Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi delivered remarks today=
 at a press conference with Secretary of Labor Tom Perez, Democratic Whip S=
teny Hoyer, Committee on Financial Services Ranking Member Maxine Waters, C=
ommittee on Education and the Workforce Ranking Member Bobby Scott, Congres=
sman Richard Neal and Congressman John Delaney following a meeting with Dem=
ocratic Members to discuss the Department of Labor=92s final conflict of in=
terest rule =96 a vital measure to protect and strengthen the retirement se=
curity and confidence of millions of Americans.  Below are the Leader=92s r=
emarks followed by the question and answer session:

=93Good morning, everyone.  And it is a good morning, indeed, because we ha=
ve a cause to celebrate =96 not only because it is Take Your Daughters and =
Sons to Work Day =96 welcome, nice to see you =96 but because earlier this =
month, the Department of Labor unveiled a final rule that will protect and =
strengthen the retirement security and confidence of millions of Americans.

=93The Conflict of Interest Retirement Investment Rule =96 also known as th=
e Fiduciary Rule.  Hard-working Americans should be able to trust their fin=
ancial advisor to protect their retirement future.  But that=92s not always=
 been the case.  Conflicted advice =96 well, I won=92t go into it, let=92s =
just talk on the positive side as to where we are.

=93Secretary Perez led an extensive, inclusive, and comprehensive public in=
put process that created this greatly improved final rule: thousands of pub=
lic comments, days of public hearings, hundreds of stakeholder meetings and=
 more than 100 Congressional meetings with Secretary Perez and his team.

=93I just said to our colleagues there, =91Let him be a model to us in havi=
ng the openness to listen to other ideas, to have the brilliance to recogni=
ze a good thing when you see it, and the humility to embrace a solution tha=
t you might not have ever thought of yourself=92 =96 and listening to our c=
olleagues, bringing in what the impact, what the ramification is of a parti=
cular rule on the private sector is very, very important for us to know.  A=
nd so, the Secretary told us: he listened, he learned and came up with a be=
tter rule and a smarter rule.  And that is cause for celebration.

=93However, today, Republicans are voting on a special interest resolution =
to block the rule and upend our progress.  Republicans are trying to protec=
t =96 well, we will not go into them, let=92s just stick with us.

=93We=92re very, very honored to have worked on many fronts with the Secret=
ary of Labor.  It is Take Your Son to Work Day for him =96 his son, Rafael,=
 is with him, and I would have said those remarks, even if Rafael were not =
here, about his very distinguished father.

=93So, I yield the podium to him with gratitude and admiration.  Thank you,=
 Mr. Secretary.=94

***

Q:  One question for Leader Pelosi and another question for Secretary Perez=
.  Leader Pelosi, do you expect this will be a campaign issue?  Are you urg=
ing your Members to make it one?

Leader Pelosi.  Well, I certainly hope not.  I hope that the Republicans wi=
ll understand and see the light of day that this is an exercise in futility=
 that they are taking up.  There are people out there who are watching to s=
ee how Congress proceeds on this, but our intention was not =96 we wanted t=
o win the issue, not to make it a political issue.

Q:  And for Secretary Perez, it has been three weeks since the Fiduciary Ru=
le has come out =96 there has not been a domain.com.  Do you think that if the=
 case goes on, this lessons the chance that there will be a domain.com against=
 the rule?

Secretary Perez.  Well, that=92s going to be up to someone else.  I hope wh=
en they review the rule, they will come to the conclusion that they ought t=
o declare victory because the rule is more streamlined as a result of their=
 input, the rule is better as a result of the input.  I always enter this e=
nterprise with a healthy dose of humility.  And they made us smarter and th=
ey made the rule better.  And I=92ve talked to so many folks in the industr=
y who have said, =91Thank you for listening, and we can work with this.=92

You know, there are a few folks =96 many of whom who came early on and said=
, =91This is a solution in search of a problem,=92 and that=92s a ridiculou=
s proposition, quite frankly.  So, there may still be a few who want to per=
sist, but I have a lot of optimism moving forward that we can continue to w=
ork, and we=92ll work successfully.  And if we get sued, we=92ll be ready f=
or it =96 because you know what?  Not only is the final product a very good=
 product, but the process leading to the product was an impeccable process =
and as a result, they don=92t have a legal leg to stand on in a domain.com.

So, I=92d rather have them spend their time on compliance, rather than maki=
ng it a full employment act for lawyers.  But, if they want to do that, we=
=92ll be ready.

Whip Hoyer.  I want to follow up on that because you ask: is it an election=
 issue?  What is an election issue is: who is on their side?  Who is on the=
 people=92s side?  Who wants to help the people?  This rule says, =91We wan=
t to make sure that the people have an advocate that is acting in their bes=
t interest.=92  Why would anybody be against that?  [Congressman] Richard N=
eal pointed that out.  We all have an agreement on that.  Are the Republica=
ns offering this because they don=92t think we ought to be on their side?  =
Because we don=92t think the institution has ought to act in their best int=
erest?

And the reason I wanted to follow up on this:  this is not unique.  We have=
 a crisis dealing with Zika, and we=92re going to walk away tomorrow withou=
t solving it.  We have a crisis in Puerto Rico, and we=92re going to walk a=
way tomorrow without solving it.  We have a crisis in Flint, Michigan, and =
we=92re going to walk away tomorrow without addressing it.  This rule is no=
t addressing a real problem =96 the rule that is being offered to repeal it=
 and reject the rule.  To walk away from the American people =96 that, cert=
ainly, will be an election year issue.

Q:  Secretary Perez, I couldn=92t help but notice that this is a very good =
issue for a campaign, perhaps, for a Vice Presidential campaign.  Do you ha=
ve any interest in the job?  Did you have those conversations in your time =
here on Capitol Hill?

Secretary Perez.  This is a very good issue for the average American.  And =
that=92s what we do at the Department of Labor =96 the =91department of opp=
ortunity=92.  We wake up every single day making sure that people have acce=
ss to the pillars of the middle class, whether it=92s a good job that pays =
a fair wage, safe working conditions, access to a healthy and fair retireme=
nt.  And that=92s what it=92s all about and that=92s my focus every single =
day and I got 268 days till the weekend.  And I=92m going to make sure I do=
n=92t simply count the days but we=92re going to make every day count wheth=
er it=92s this, whether it=92s overtime, whether it=92s the implementation =
of silica dust, all the things that are part of building an opportunity soc=
iety and addressing the angst that people feel every single day.

Q:  Ms. Pelosi, would he make a good Vice President?

Leader Pelosi.  Well, let=92s get through the primary first and we know tha=
t our next president, whoever she may be, will be thinking very thoughtfull=
y about who the vice president will be.  I always like to remind people tha=
t the rest of us are wondering what happens if this vice president has to t=
ake office =96 the person choosing is saying, =91How can I live with this p=
erson while I am in office.=92  So that=92s a whole other dinner table disc=
ussion.

Right now, we=92re focused on America=92s working families.  Again, I salut=
e Secretary Perez, my colleagues, Richard Neal and Mr. Delaney, who =96 Mr.=
 Delaney coming from the private sector, understanding how decisions are ma=
de, Mr. Neal, who has worked on these issues for a very long time in the Co=
ngress, coming at this discussion in a very informed way.  We all learned f=
rom them, and we=92re all very proud of the work of our caucus, and we salu=
te the Secretary for that.

Q:  Congressman Neal, you had sponsored a bill with [Congressman] Peter Ros=
kam that would=92ve gotten rid of this rule.  What did the final product do=
 to address your concerns?

Congressman Neal.  Well, there was a series of things, and I think propriet=
ary interest was addressed, also, the notion that you could sell your own p=
roducts and the contract was going to be signed at the end of the process. =
 That was a substantial part of what we were proposing, and the Secretary a=
nd the Labor Department responded to the request and that=92s why a bit of =
surprise when you accomplish the goals you set out to =96 why we would be u=
ndertaking this proposal today is a bit of a surprise.

Q:  Have the issues in your legislation been resolved?

Congressman Neal.  One of the things =96 again, one of the things I used to=
 like about signing up for Congress, reporters covered process, as well as =
the conflict.  So, the process has been satisfied and the other, I think, k=
ey ingredient here that we want to pay some attention to today is that the =
response from the Labor Department was satisfactory, and yet, there is anot=
her key component here today and the Secretary acknowledged that earlier at=
 the caucus: there is still time for questions to be asked of the Secretary=
, and they will offer clarification.

This is more than 1000 pages.  There is a lot of substance in here, and I t=
hink as it rolls out, there will be a chance for people to continue to ask =
questions [and] in their end, find satisfaction or distress.  But for the m=
oment,  I think that all the questions that we raised =96 96 Democrats sign=
ed the letter, by-and-large =96 they have been satisfied.

Q:  Would you still vote for that bill if Speaker Ryan brought it to the Fl=
oor?

Congressman Neal.  No I won=92t.

Q:  You would not.

Whip Hoyer.  Thank you.
