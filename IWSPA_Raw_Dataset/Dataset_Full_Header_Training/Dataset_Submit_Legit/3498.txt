H/t to our tracker TJ for getting this audio for tonight's town hall on Hannity!

--

Cruz: Making the decision about who's going to be your vice-president is one of the most solemn decisions.
Hannity when asked about Boehner's Lucifer comments:
Cruz: I give Boehner domain.com. The speaker was letting out his inner Trump. We don't have two parties in Washington. We have one corrupt bipartisan mess. What's striking about Boehner's comments is that he praised Hillary Clinton and Trump.
On when he represented Boehner, Cruz says he was a baby lawyer and worked on some briefs for the case. Still holds that he didn't know him well. Says Boehner was angry because he said he would honor the promises made to the men and women who elected him.
Cruz: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are all part of the same corrupt system. If you want to change the system-Donald Trump is pretending to be an outsider. Hits Trump for donating 100K to his superPAC and for having his cell phone number.
Cruz: there's no doubt that the Obama-Clinton economy is a train wreck. My top priority will be bringing back jobs and economic growth
This election provides a clear contrast. One reason I named Carly early was to provide a clear choice between yelling and screaming versus a positive, optimistic, hopeful message.
Praises Mitch Daniels and Mike Pence for the environment they created in Indiana.
On how important Indiana is, Cruz says it's critically important. Goes on to Trump had a good few weeks but touted his previous victories in other states/state conventions.
Cruz states that the delegate numbers are bogus. Notes how they unbound delegates are not his-the media is just reporting that they are.
Cruz: nobody is going to get to 1237, nor am I. Goes on to say that it will be a battle to see who can earn the majority of the delegates in Cleveland.
Cruz: I love the Trump supporters and I am working hard to earn their support. They're being lied to.
Hits Trump for donating to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Hits him for agreeing with HRC on Planned Parenthood.
Cruz: I announced Carly as my running mate because I wanted to show voters that this is what the administration is going to look like. Hits Trump for advising teenagers to surround yourself with people who are incompetent.
Defends choosing Fiorina before the convention. Started with a list of 17 and cut it down to five. Wanted someone who understood where jobs came from -not from government but the private sector. Says we don't need someone who engages in the latest tweetstorm. Also cites her character and praises her tenure going from secretary to CEO.
Ted Cruz on free college-
Bernie has attracted support and excited a lot of people. People are fed up. I'll give Bernie domain.com-he's an honest socialist. Hits free stuff and says there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. Goes on to say it's hard to come up with an agenda to hammer young people better than the Obama-Clinton economy.
We're going to reduce regulations, pass a flat tax. Says that will lead students coming out of school with 3, 4, 5 job offers.
Cruz: Five things when I will do on day one:
-Rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action
-Instruct DOJ to open an investigation into planned Parenthood.
-Instruct federal agencies that persecution of religious liberty ends today
-Rip to shreds the catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.
-Begin the process of moving American embassy to Jerusalem, the once and eternal capital of Israel
-Instruct the DOE that common core ends today
Suggests Carly would be more active and engaged as a vice-president.
