llowing statement:

=93For years, Texas Republicans have created the environment for someone li=
ke Donald Trump to thrive. The Grand Old Party is dead. This is now Donald =
Trump's Republican Party.

=93Put simply, Trump only cares about Trump. He has built a campaign on rac=
ism, sexism, and xenophobia. He has the support of KKK leaders and incites =
violence among his supporters. Clearly, he=92s not fighting for Texas famil=
ies.
