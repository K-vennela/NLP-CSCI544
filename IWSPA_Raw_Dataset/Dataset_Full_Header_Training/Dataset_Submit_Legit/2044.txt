[cid:image002.jpg@01D1A62F.59F22450]
Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Members of the bipartisan Congressional =

Lima, Peru =96 Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi today released the following =
statement after the bipartisan delegation to Peru concluded meetings with P=
eruvian Prime Minister Pedro Cateriano Bellido and domain.com Members; Fulbrig=
ht scholarship alumni; and environmental and labor leaders.  The bipartisan=

"The highlight of our meeting was at the historic Presidential Palace, wher=
e the delegation met with Prime Minister Pedro Cateriano Bellido, Secretary=
 of the Economy/Economy Minister Alonso Seguro, and Minister of Trade and T=
ourism Magali Silva.  We spoke about the importance of robust counter-narco=
tics cooperation and other bilateral security initiatives.  As we discussed=
 implementation of the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement, we underscored the s=
ignificance of smart economic growth that ensures the protection of workers=
, of the environment, and of indigenous people.

"While in Lima, we also met with labor and environmental leaders about the =
impact of the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement.  We discussed the growing soc=
ial demand for conservation in Peru and challenges that continue as Peru de=
velops its economy and environmental protection infrastructure.  We heard m=
ore about the struggle to implement freedom of association and improved wor=
king conditions and the need to further develop Peru's capacity to enforce =
its labor laws.  We had a very informative session with representatives fro=
m the American Chamber of Commerce regarding the potential benefits and cha=
llenges associated with Trans-Pacific Partnership.

"The delegation arrived in Peru on the 60th anniversary of the Fulbright Sc=
holarship Program in Peru.  We were pleased to meet distinguished Fulbright=
 alumni, who represent the public, private, education, environmental and ar=
ts sectors.  We are proud of their accomplishments and commitment to better=
ing economic, cultural and bilateral ties between the United States and Per=
u, as was Senator Fulbright's intention.

"We thank Ambassador Brian Nichols and U.S. Embassy Lima team for their cou=
ntry team briefings, guidance and support during our domain.com."
