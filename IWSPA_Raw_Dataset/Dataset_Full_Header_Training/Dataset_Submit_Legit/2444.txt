By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; user@domain.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; user@domain.com)

Good Friday morning. Trump's on a morning-show tear, naughtily speculating on "Fox & Friends" about Hillary's idea of putting Bill in charge of economic issues: "I don't know. Maybe he'll bring the 'Energizer' with him. ... [M]aybe she just wants him around the White House so she can keep her eye on him." <<link>> 

BREAKING - "RNC Reserves an Unprecedented $150 Million in Digital Video Ads: Party Claims Inventory From Google and Others to Reach Hispanics and Women," by AdAge's Kate Kaye: "The amount ... represents an acknowledgement on the part of the RNC that the party's likely nominee will need more help than usual on the digital front." <<link>>

INSIDE THE CAMPAIGNS -- "GOP elite line up behind Donald Trump," by Alex Isenstadt: "The Never Trump moment is over. While a small group of Republicans has wrung its hands raw over the choice between the GOP's nominee and Hillary Clinton, the party's firmament - social and intellectual conservatives, the lobbyist and donor class, powerful operatives and outside groups - is increasingly getting in line behind Donald Trump. ...

"The thawing has slowly but surely begun ... from mega-donors like Foster Friess rallying Republican governors to Trump, to Mitt Romney's allies agreeing to raise money for him, to leaders of the Never Trump movement conceding their cause is lost." <<link>>

--"Manafort to GOP aides: Trump's 'behavior can be changed,'" by Burgess Everett, Seung Min Kim and Eli Stokols: "Trump's newly empowered chief strategist sought to convince top GOP congressional officials on Capitol Hill that Trump can compete for the Latino vote, domain.com Hillary Clinton's weaknesses and become a Reaganesque figure in the party ... Facing a room full of seasoned campaign veterans and longtime congressional aides at D.C. law firm Jones day on Capitol Hill, Manafort ... told attendees that Ronald Reagan used to be criticized just like Trump is now for his polarizing reputation within the Republican Party." <<link>> 

THE MAP -- "Trump's map: The downside," by Katie Glueck: "[P]olls out of Arizona and Georgia are heightening GOP anxiety about the prospect that the two states, long reliably red at the presidential level, could bolt to Hillary Clinton ... It's the downside of Donald Trump's potential to rewire the electoral map. Just as [he] shows signs he could pick off some longstanding Democratic Rust Belt states, his hardline approach to immigration and controversial remarks about women and minorities run the risk of accelerating trends in Arizona and Georgia that could turn them blue." <<link>> 

COMING ATTRACTIONS - "Trump, Clinton speeches to highlight US divisions on guns," by AP's Ryan Foley and Lisa Marie Pane: "Trump and other top Republicans will speak at the National Rifle Association convention [today] in Louisville, where organizers are trying to unite gun-rights voters by painting Clinton as a foe of their causes who must be stopped. Clinton will appear [tomorrow] in Florida with the mother of Trayvon Martin and other parents who have lost children to gun violence. She's become a forceful advocate for restrictions meant to reduce the nation's 33,000 annual gun deaths." <<link>> 

CLINTON, INC. -- "Inside the Clinton paid speech machine: What, exactly, do you get when you pay a Clinton $285,000 for an intimate, closed-to-the-press speech?" by Annie Karni: "A transcript of a private $285,000 paid speech Bill Clinton delivered last year at the 'China-U.S. Private Investment domain.com' in Austin ... offers a glimpse behind the curtain of the Clintons' controversial paid speaking gigs ... 'Once I got a cartoon in the mail when I was fighting out that Whitewater business,' he reminisced in front of about 60 Chinese investors and 150 American businesspeople ... in late March 2015 - two weeks before Hillary Clinton officially declared ...

"'And Jiang Zemin and I are sitting together at a state dinner, and in the first frame, I say to President Jiang, I said, "You know, you're doing great economically, but our country has more human rights." And he looked at me and he said, "Yes, and if you were the leader of China, Ken Starr would be in prison making running shoes."' A self-deprecating Clinton admitted of those scandal-tarred days of his presidency: 'I saved that cartoon for a long time. I must say there were days when I wondered who had the better model.'" <<link>> 

TALKER -- "Costs of celebrity college commencement speakers can add up," by AP's Collin Binkley in Boston: "[T]he University of Houston paid $35,000 to book astronaut Scott Kelly as the commencement speaker. Rutgers University paid $35,000 for journalist Bill Moyers, who spoke after the keynote speech from the unpaid President Barack Obama. .... The University of Houston, which increased tuition this year, paid $166,000 to bring Matthew McConaughey to speak last spring, including $9,500 for his airfare. The University of Oklahoma paid $110,000 to book journalist Katie Couric in 2006. Both speakers donated their fees to charity, but their costs sparked a debate about whether colleges pay too
 much for pageantry." <<link>>

REMEBERING CHRIS WALLACE's MOM: "Norma 'Kappy' Leonard passed away Monday night. She was 95 years old. She was the mother of Chris Wallace and the widow of former CBS News President Bill Leonard. She met Leonard in 1952 when he was covering the Democratic Convention in Chicago. As he rose through the ranks of CBS over the years, she became the unofficial First Lady of the news division, hosting the CBS news team at the conventions and other big events.

"Her first husband was Mike Wallace. They met as undergraduates at the University of Michigan and married in 1940. They had 2 sons, Chris and Peter Wallace, who was killed in a climbing accident in 1962. She played a big role at CBS in 1962. Mike Wallace wanted to come to CBS News from the entertainment side of television. But then-CBS News President Dick Salant asked Bill Leonard, then head of the Election domain.com, if that would create any problems for him. 

"Only after Kappy Leonard gave her OK did Mike Wallace get a job at CBS News. Kappy Leonard is survived by her son Chris, 5 stepsons, 12 grandchildren, and 7 great-grandchildren." Service in D.C. this weekend.

--Chris tells Playbookers: "My mom's life was intertwined with TV news. She was married to two giants of the industry. And she was the den mother for generations of CBS News journalists. She was a savvy producer and editor. And a great many of her insights ended up on the air. In her spare time, she was a wonderful mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. Three generations of Wallaces and Leonards miss her deeply."
