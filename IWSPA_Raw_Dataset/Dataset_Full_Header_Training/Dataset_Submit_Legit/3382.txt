Okay. Let's put the quote out and then a more extensive release later outlining everyone. Our quote will get into the stories now. Does that work?

SL: Whom Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley Are Holding Out For

Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley have long been waiting for this day - to see whom their party's frontrunner would consider nominating to the Supreme Court. The day has finally come, and it's nothing pretty.

"The Supreme Court nominating process is serious, Donald Trump is not. Again and again he has demonstrated he lacks the experience and temperament to be an effective commander-in-chief. So it comes as no surprise that his list of top picks for the Supreme Court is full of red flags.

"The judges he wants to elevate to our highest court have a history of making the same sort of unpredictable, extreme decisions that we see every day from Trump. It's bad enough that Senate Republicans refuse to uphold the Constitution, do their jobs and hold hearings on President Obama's eminently qualified nominee. But, it's worse that the reason for the obstruction is their hope that Trump would get to nominate one of these judges." - OrganizationPress Secretary Mark Paustenbach

No one is more qualified to immediately serve on the Supreme Court than Chief Judge Merrick Garland - but Senate Republicans continue to say they won't meet with Chief Judge Garland, hold a hearing or vote on his nomination.

yeah, it will take a bit to get the other six. May also be worth calling out or flacking to reporters that he seems like he is doing this to distract from his PFD. Flooding the zone. What is he hiding?

BREAKING: Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump releases list of 11 potential nominees to U.S. Supreme Court.

Original Tweet: <<link>>

<<link>>
Trump's picks include Steven Colloton of Iowa, Allison Eid of Colorado and Raymond Gruender of Missouri.
Also on the list are: Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, Joan Larsen of Michigan, Thomas Lee of Utah, William Pryor of Alabama, David Stras of Minnesota, Diane Sykes of Wisconsin and Don Willett of Texas
So we have research on Colloton, Gruender, Pryor, Sykes and Willett. Still need information on the other 6 judges he named. Below is the release we worked up a couple weeks ago. I also attached the original doc I put together that has some information on Gruender.

No one is more qualified to immediately serve on the Supreme Court than Chief Judge Merrick Garland - but Senate Republicans continue to say they won't meet with Chief Judge Garland, hold a hearing or vote on his nomination.

Bill Pryor

In addition, Kavanaugh authored an opinion<<<link>>> that upheld South Carolina's restrictive voter ID law.

*         Kavanaugh has argued<<<link>>> that a president may refuse to enforce a law if he or she personally deems that law unconstitutional, even if the Supreme Court has previously upheld it. should have the authority to decline<<<link>>> to enforce a statute that regulates private individuals when the president deems the statute unconstitutional, even if a court has held or would hold the statute constitutional.

Paul Clement

*         Paul Clement has taken action on his out-of-touch views on immigration, serving as lead counsel to defend SB 70, Arizona's extreme immigration law. Republicans have continually hired Paul Clement to defend their out of touch views on immigration, health care, and LGBT rights.

*         Clement has "pledged to the destruction<<<link>>>" of the Affordable Care Act, which would take away quality, affordable health insurance from millions of 20 million Americans. He served as lead counsel<<<link>>> in the domain.com that first challenged the authority of the ACA.
