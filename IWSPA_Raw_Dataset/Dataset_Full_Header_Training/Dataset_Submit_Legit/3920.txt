Hi Lindsey, We've been able to increase our bookings month over month, but need to continue fostering the relationships. Pablo has the opportunity to go up next week for several meetings to reinforce our asks and flesh out a plan with the bookers. Can I get approval to have him book a train and one night for next week?
