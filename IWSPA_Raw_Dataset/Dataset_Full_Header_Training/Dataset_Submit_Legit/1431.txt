icially lift trump somewhat. Insane

Zac is okay with the focus on House and Senate Republicans being bad on inf=
rastructure and guns.

He just doesn=92t want to link the House and Senate Republicans to Trump.

His broader point: the campaign does not want to connect Trump and the Repu=
blican Party. They want to make Trump look even more extreme than the rank-=
and-file Republican Member of Congress. Otherwise, in their mind, Trump wil=
l come across as less scary than he really is.

Thoughts?
