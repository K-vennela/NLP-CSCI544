Hi Celia, my window's closing so just didn't want to lock something else in if this is a possibility. Thanks.

Hi Joanna, since the Chair's trip to California is tomorrow, I want to check in one last time since we'll release the time on her schedule. If there's any chance we can do this I would need to know asap.

Best regards, - User.

Hi Joanna, the Chair of the Organization, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, will be in Los Angeles on Wednesday May 4th. She's a fan of Jimmy Kimmel's and so if you're not entirely booked up for that night let me know if he'd want to have her on for a few minutes.

If you want to talk by phone about possibilities, let me know. Best regards, - User.
