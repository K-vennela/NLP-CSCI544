Yeah, she agreed to do it.  I was gonna put it though all approvals on our end and then send to her folks (she cc-ed them on the reply) and they can tailor it as needed.

I would have this come on her letterhead and then we forward it for maximum impact
Looks out of whack to Jersey press corps if Weinberg statement is going out on our letterhead

Senate Majority Leader Weinberg Calls on Gov. Christie to Resign in Light of His New Role as Trump Campaign Chair

Trenton- Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg called on Governor Chris Christie to resign today, in light of the announcement that he will serve as Donald Trump's transition chair<<<link>>#incart_river_index> in a Trump administration. The announcement follows six newspaper editorial boards<<<link>>> calling on a Christie resignation, citing "long neglect of the state to pursue his own selfish agenda." Last week, Christie's approval rating among New Jersey residents dropped to 26 percent<<<link>>>, his lowest to date.

"In light of today's news, I am once again calling on Governor Christie to resign," said Senator Weinberg. "Despite quitting his quixotic domain.com of the presidency, he has continued to pursue his own, self-serving plans at the expense of New Jerseyans by acting as a foot soldier to such an extreme and divisive candidate as Donald Trump. It's time that our governor actually act in the interest of our state and give the job to someone who is engaged on the problems facing New Jersey."

Senator Weinberg had co-sponsored a bill last year that would have required New Jersey governors to resign<<<link>>> in order to run for President. While campaigning for the presidency, Christie spent over 70 percent<<<link>>#8> of his time out of state last year.
