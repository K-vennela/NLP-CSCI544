Pierson:

Trump will release taxes after the domain.com is complete

Its not G Stephanopoulos's business until the domain.com is finished

Q: Is he moving toward the center?

No not at all

He hasn't backpedaled on his Muslim ban. People in media he is saying he is, that's not the case

Heard ban included all Muslims, but it didn't. it never included American Muslims living abroad. That has been complete media spin and proven false

Q: Should there still be a Muslim ban with only a few exceptions?

Muslim ban was an immigration policy. We were talking about people who we don't know. We know the mayor of London and King Abdullah

People who we don't know need to go through

Pierson said the ban didn't include Muslim tourists

Q: Never meant tourists would be banned

It never included every Muslim. It was an immigration policy

Q: Ban on Muslim tourists?

If they couldn't be identified, then yes.

If they did have paperwork, those would be the exceptions

Q: He called it a total and complete shutdown

Yes, that was an immigration policy. Not going to let the media twist this

Q: Audio specialist thought John Miller had DJT's voice

Don't know who that person is or who paid that person

Need to know why this is national news. This isn't newsworthy

Looking forward to CNN of HRC laughing about getting off a child rapist

Q: If he lied about it to Guthrie when it was, I think that raises it to another level

But I think Trump would be the expert on if it is Trump.

One audio specialist said it was him and I never heard of him.

We have serious problems, we have ISIS. And we are talking about a People Mag interview

Q: Did he have someone on his staff named John Miller or Barron

Looking into it. Not him on the audio, doesn't sound like him.

This is why people go to Facebook for news

Q: Wolf: it would be news if he lied on national television to people about it

HRC representing a child rapist should be news

This whole thing is made up

Q: He did testify that he has used a fake name

Name you are referring to is Barron. This is Miller, not the same thing

This isn't news, this isn't a news story
