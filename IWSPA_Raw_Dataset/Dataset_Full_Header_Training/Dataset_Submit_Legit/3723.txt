Hi Daniel, Not sure it's worth the time if this is just a hit piece like Friday's. While you included the Chair's answer, the article didn't at all contextualize how the committees are organized.

This line was particularly bogus since it was put in there to dismiss her explanation instead of adding context:

That answer, however, carefully eludes the heart of the Sanders camp's grievance: that the allocation of the initial 75 DNC-nominated standing committee members doesn't in any way reflect the proportion of the vote the senator has won in the primaries and caucuses.

Hey User

So me and Gabe are working on a story looking up at the upcoming Democratic state conventions before Philadelphia and we were wondering if you could pass along a complete list. No fingerprints from you is completely fine.
