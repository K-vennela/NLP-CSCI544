try of immigrants and refugees and that=92s the message I want to send,=94 =
he said.

Demonstrators scheduled a =93peacekeeping=94 training Friday evening to lea=

=93We=92re going to work with our local law enforcement to create a secure =

Jim Brunner<<<link>>>, Seattle Times

While thousands of supporters of Republican presidential hopeful Donald Tru=

nslee and other critics rolled out the unwelcome mat.

In his first campaign trip to Washington, Trump is scheduled to speak at no=

3,000 near the Canadian border.

The arrival of the New York billionaire ahead of the May 24 presidential pr=

a Trump rally in California last week turned violent after some demonstrato=
rs reportedly threw rocks<<<link>>

State Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, a state leader for the Trump campaign=
, said he hopes that won=92t be repeated here.

=93I=92m optimistic that the people of Washington state can show we=92re di=
fferent. Trump supporters should have a right to hear Trump,=94 he said.

But Inslee, a Democrat, joined other critics Friday at Seattle=92s El Centr=
o de la Raza, a Beacon Hill community center, to denounce Trump=92s rhetori=
c as offensive and out of step with the values of Washington state.

During a news conference with groups representing women, immigrants, Muslim=
s and others, Inslee called Trump dangerous and likened him to a schoolyard=
 bully compensating for his own insecurities.

=93I know that Mr. Trump is a millionaire with a million insecurities,=94 I=
nslee said. =93If you are watching this show right now, hear this: Your hat=
e is not welcome in our state.=94

Attendees at the news conference accused Trump of emboldening racists with =
his rhetoric and proposals such as a temporary ban<<<link>>
12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/> on Muslims entering th=
e country.

Varisha Kahn, a student at the University of Washington, said she is a prou=
d Muslim American who has experienced threats herself, including a brick th=
rown through the window of a local mosque.

=93Hate speech leads to hate crimes,=94 she said.

Trump=92s Lynden rally is scheduled to be held outdoors at the Northwest Wa=
shington Fair and Event Center<<<link>>>, with a capacity of ab=
out 5,000 people. While Lynden is relatively small, it is not far from the =
college town of Bellingham =97 and protesters from Seattle and elsewhere we=
re making plans to head up Interstate 5.

Authorities in domain.com County were advising anyone going to the event to he=
ed security requirements.

No firearms, knives of any size, umbrellas, signs, banners or tripods will =
be allowed at the rally, the domain.com County Sheriff=92s Office said in a ne=
ws release.

The Sheriff=92s Office said attendees will be required to walk through a sc=
reening device similar to those for airport security. Large bags are prohib=
ited and small bags could be searched.

=93A good rule of thumb to follow: Do not bring any items to the event that=
 would not be allowed through screening at an airport checkpoint,=94 the Sh=
eriff=92s Office said.

The Sheriff=92s Office said it is =93not allowed=94 to release specific inf=
ormation about planned security, but said the Secret Service is assisting, =
as is Homeland Security, Lynden police and the Washington State Patrol.

=93We hope those who attend or are in the area during rallies will do their=
 part to ensure civility defines our actions,=94 the Sheriff=92s Office sai=
d.

It also urged people to arrive early and to expect heavy traffic and troubl=
e with parking.

Seattleites bound for the rally may have an especially difficult time getti=
ng through Marysville, where the Washington Department of Transportation sa=
ys Interstate 5 will be limited to two lanes on Saturday for construction a=
t the Ebey Slough Bridge<<<link>>
ebeybridgerpr/>.

The fact that Trump skipped the Seattle area in favor of a more remote loca=
le was greeted as a win by Nicole Grant, executive secretary-treasurer of t=
he M.L. King County Labor Council, one of the groups that vowed major prote=
sts if Trump tried to speak in the area.

=93We feel good. There is not going to be a Donald Trump rally in King Coun=
ty. He saw that the well was poisoned,=94 Grant said.

Trump campaign officials say they were not intimidated at all and did try t=
o organize an event in a hangar at Seattle=92s Boeing Field =97 but that th=
e plan fell through.

Ericksen said =93we had it all lined up=94 but could not get the required p=
domain.com from King County, leaving him scrambling to nail down the alternate l=
ocation.

County officials said there was no unfair treatment.

Frank Abe, a spokesman for the King County transportation department, said =
Ericksen had been talking with a private tenant at the airport about holdin=
g his rally in a hangar.

Abe said the tenant was reminded that a detailed security and parking plan =
was required for nonaviation uses of the airport. Such a plan was never sub=
mitted to airport officials, he said.

Airport Director Randall Berg said the county=92s actions were =93absolutel=
y not=94 politically motivated.

Berg said a planned rally of that size is unprecedented on the east side of=
 the airfield and would have been a big logistical problem =97 even before =
considering possible protests outside. He said the tenant, whom he said did=
 not want to be identified, ultimately agreed and did not formally seek a p=
domain.com.

Ericksen said he also explored Paine Field in Everett but was unable to agr=
ee on terms there.

A contract to use the fairgrounds in Lynden was finalized Thursday night.

Ericksen shrugged off the challenges. =93Lynden is nicer than Seattle,=94 h=
e said.
