No. We had a whole back and forth on this exact subject where you made the
exact arguments you're making now.

Our conversation on Wednesday was about driving the wedge between Paul Ryan
and Donald Trump, where Paul Ryan had trouble with his muslim ban and
deportation squad etc... and that he would have to cave in order to get to
Trump's position.  Short of that: just sticking with the general disunity
theme and chaos in the Republican party, staying out of policy. That's what
you agreed to do on the 1:30pm call yesterday. That's what I informed our
campaign that you would be doing. We specifically talked about how we don't
want to tie them together just yet or talk about the Ryan-Trump agenda.
