Punt to NV state party

And then give them this quote:

"Democrats remain unified and energized as we head toward the convention and Election Day. In our primary contests across the country, Democratic voters continue to report that they believe our primary process has unified the party, and that they are enthusiastic about both of our candidates. At the same time, our candidates have each said they will support the eventual nominee and help make sure that Donald Trump and his reckless and divisive policies never set foot in the Oval Office."
