Just something quick I whipped up. Let me know what you think.

SL: "Mr. Trump took to Twitter Sunday to deny he has mistreated women.=94

Today, the Wall Street Journal reported<<<link>>
ublicans-say-donald-trump-is-changing-the-political-playbook-1463339320?mod=
=3De2tw> that =93Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to deny he has mistrea=
ted women.=94

Oh really?

On Megyn Kelly=85.

Or Arianna Huffington=85.

Or that time he called her a dog=85.

Or attacking a woman because of the way she looks=85..

Or that time he harassed Heidi Cruz<<<link>>

elly a bimbo<<<link>>>=
=85.

So there=92s not much denying that Trump can do here. He has had a long, pe=
rsistent hatred and mistreatment of women, and he has his own words to prov=
e it.

Because of his disgusting and sexist attacks on women, Donald Trump is unfi=
t to be president.
