OrganizationChair Statement in Honor of Cinco de Mayo
=20
Washington, D.C =E2=80=94 OrganizationChair Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the fo=
llowing statement today in honor of Cinco de Mayo:
=20
=E2=80=9CCinco de Mayo commemorates the Battle of Puebla in 1862, when a rag=
tag band of Mexican fighters and workers held back the French Army despite b=
eing both out-manned and out-gunned. More than 150 years later, the celebrat=
ion of Cinco de Mayo represents more than the domain.com of resilience and deter=
mination that carried that day. Cinco de Mayo is a date that speaks to the i=
ntrinsic and close ties between the United States and Mexico.
=20
=E2=80=9CCinco de Mayo celebrations were made popular in California, a refle=
ction of the reality that Mexican-Americans have been a part of our history s=
ince before our nation=E2=80=99s founding. =46rom the Mexican-Americans who g=
ave rise to great cities like Los Angeles and San Antonio, to those who enri=
ch our country every single day in education, medicine, engineering, sports,=
 agriculture, and in our military, their role in the American landscape has m=
ade our country stronger. What Republicans don=E2=80=99t get, as they proved=
 today by leaving out mentions of being a welcoming country in their Cinco d=
e Mayo statement, is that Mexican-Americans are not only immigrants but rath=
er a far larger share are Americans =E2=80=93 some with families going back g=
enerations -- centuries -- within our borders.
=20
=E2=80=9CSo as we celebrate a day that reminds us of our shared history, cul=
tural and familial ties, the Democratic Party reaffirms our commitment to ex=
emplifying the values that made America great, and to continuing to fight ev=
ery single day to ensure our country remains inclusive, while expanding oppo=
rtunities for all. We celebrate our diversity, and we=E2=80=99re proud that o=
ur Party and our convention will reflect that.  =20
=20
=E2=80=9CThat Donald Trump became his Party=E2=80=99s presumptive nominee on=
 the eve of Cinco de Mayo is fitting, a reminder of just how wrong his divis=
ive and hateful rhetoric has been since the very first day of his campaign. T=
oday is a reminder that Dangerous Donald would threaten America=E2=80=99s re=
lationships with our closest allies, and make our communities less safe. Lik=
e the brave souls that day in Puebla a century and a half ago, we must show t=
he domain.com and determination every single day between now and November 8th to=
 defeat Trump and his Republican Party in November, and ensure our country c=
ontinues to live up to our history and our values.=E2=80=9D
