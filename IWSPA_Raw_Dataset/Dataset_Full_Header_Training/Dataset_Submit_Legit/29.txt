EVENTS

DONALD TRUMP
TRUMP ON THE GOP: “DOES IT HAVE TO BE UNIFIED?” “Donald Trump says he thinks he can win the general election, even if the Republican Party does not unify to support his candidacy. ‘Does it have to be unified? I'm very different than everybody else, perhaps, that's ever run for office. I actually don't think so,’ Trump told George Stephanopoulos in an interview that will air Sunday on ABC News' ‘This Week.’ A growing list of Republicans have come out and said they will not vote for their party's presumptive presidential nominee in November, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, and the Republican Party's 2015 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney. But none of that is rattling Trump.” [ABC News, 5/7/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP DOESN’T KNOW WHAT THE GI BILL IS: “CHRIS CUOMO: “We tried to get your campaign and the other campaigns to hold forth or whether or not they supported the current GI bill…Do you support maintaining the GI bill the way it is and growing it instead of cutting it?” DONALD TRUMP: “I don’t want to hurt our vets. We treat illegal immigrants better than our vets. I’m going to help the vets. I’m going to only help them. - unlike Hillary Clinton who thinks the vets are getting too much? They’re not. I’ve traveled, seen so many vets I know so many vets now and have a lot of friends. I have developed great friendships among the vets. Our vets are -” CHRIS CUOMO: “Is that a yes, ‘I do support the current GI bill?’” DONALD TRUMP: “No. I want to bring jobs back to our country and make the country grow again. I just traveled. I won so many states in a row in massive landslides and part of the reason was trade. Not what you brought up at the beginning of the show, totally inappropriate. Part of the reason I won was because of trade and I talk trade and I’m the only one that can do anything about trade.”… Clearly, Donald Trump has no idea what the GI Bill is… Regardless, like on pretty much every issue, Trump talks long and loud, to hide the fact that he is utterly and totally clueless.” [Huffington Post, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP SAYS U.S. WILL NEVER DEFAULT BECAUSE “YOU PRINT THE MONEY”: “Trump insisted that he never said the U.S. should default or attempt to renegotiate with creditors, as had been reported. ‘People said I want to go and buy debt and default on debt, and I mean, these people are crazy. This is the United States government,’ Trump told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ‘New Day.’ ‘First of all, you never have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you, OK?’ Trump said he would center his approach on debt buybacks if and when interest rates go up.” [CNN, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP ON MINIMUM WAGE - “PEOPLE HAVE TO GET MORE”: “The only way to conclude that he’s actually shifting his positions in any real sense is to treat the idea of having a ‘position’ as if it’s utterly meaningless. First, the minimum wage. On ABC’s This Week, Trump said that ‘I am looking at it and I haven’t decided in terms of numbers,’ adding that ‘people have to get more.’ Asked whether this was a ‘change,’ Trump said, ‘well, sure, it’s a change.’ But in the context of the policy debate, these phrases mean exactly nothing. Trump is saying generally that people’s wages have to rise, not that he intends to work with Congress to raise the federal minimum wage. When Trump says this is a ‘change,’ the most plausible reading is that this is a change from his general statement during the primaries that wages are ‘too high.’” [Greg Sargent, Washington Post, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP WALKS BACK HIS TAX PLAN THAT HEAVILY BENEFITTED THE WEALTHY: “‘By the time it gets negotiated, it's going to be a different plan,’ Trump told George Stephanopoulos on ABC News' ‘This Week.’ In Trump’s tax plan, the wealthiest individuals would get a tax break, with the top tax rate dropping from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. But when pressed if he wants taxes on the wealthy to go up or down, he predicted that the top rate would be higher than the plan says. ‘On my plan they're going down. But by the time it's negotiated, they'll go up,’ Trump said. ‘Look, when I'm negotiating with the Democrats, I'm putting in a plan. I'm putting in my optimum plan. It's going to be negotiated, George. It's not going to stay there. They're not going to say, “There's your plan, let's approve it.” They're going to say, “Let's see what we can do.”’” [ABC News, 5/8/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP’S NEW FINANCE CHIEF MNUCHIN CASHED OUT MADOFF PONZI PROFITS: “Donald Trump’s new national finance chairman and his family pocketed about $3.2 million in fake domain.com from his mother’s account with convicted con man Bernard Madoff -- money that didn’t have to be returned to victims because it was taken out of the Ponzi scheme in time. Steven Mnuchin, a business associate of Trump’s and also chairman and chief executive officer of the hedge fund Dune Capital Management LP, was sued in 2015 by a trustee seeking to recoup Madoff investors’ losses from customers who’d withdrawn more money from his firm than they put in.” [Bloomberg, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP CLAIMS “GOOFY ELIZABETH WARREN” IS LYING ABOUT HER NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE: “Donald Trump took to Twitter Friday evening to pile criticism on Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who earlier in the week had condemned the presumptive GOP nominee as a racist... He continued: ‘Let's properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren's records to see if she is Native American. I say she's a fraud!’ Next, he tweeted, ‘Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton's flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.’” [CNN, 5/6/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP APPOINTS CHRISTIE AS TRANSITION TEAM CHAIRMAN: “Today Donald J. Trump announced Governor Chris Christie (R-NJ) will serve as Transition Team Chairman. Mr. Trump is the presumptive Presidential nominee for the Republican Party and continues to take critical steps to gear up for the general election against potential Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, or whoever.” [Donald J. Trump for President, Release, 5/9/16<<<link>>>]
TRUMP TAPS SON-IN-LAW KUSHNER TO RUN TRANSITION TEAM: “Donald J. Trump has asked his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to begin quietly working to put together a blueprint for his transition team should he win the White House in November. Mr. Kushner, the husband of Mr. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, will work with Corey Lewandowski, the Trump campaign manager, and Paul Manafort, a senior adviser, to set up a prospective transition team and determine who its most important members should be. But Mr. Kushner is not expected to be involved if and when such a transition occurs, according to two people briefed on his new assignment.” [New York Times, 5/6/16<<<link>>:/domain.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/06/trump-asks-his-son-in-law-jared-kushner-to-plan-for-a-transition-team/>]
ENDORSEMENT TRACKER - BOB DOLE: “Mr. Trump stated, ‘I want to thank Senator Bob Dole for his endorsement. He is a wonderful man and it is a great honor to have his support.’ Senator Dole said, ‘The voters of our country have turned out in record numbers to support Mr. Trump. It is important that their votes be honored and it is time that we support the party's presumptive nominee, Donald J. Trump. I plan to attend the RNC convention in Cleveland to show my support for our party and our ticket, as I have done my entire life.’” [Donald J. Trump for President, Release, 5/7/16<<<link>>>]
