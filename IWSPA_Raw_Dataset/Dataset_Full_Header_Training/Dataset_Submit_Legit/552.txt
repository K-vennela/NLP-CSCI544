Bloomberg is doing a story on the fundraising email we just sent with Hillary Clinton's signature. The reporter wants to know if this "reflects a new agreement between the Organizationand the Clinton campaign, an acknowledgement that she will almost certainly be the Democratic nominee" and wondered if we were "at all concerned that Sanders supporters will see this as the Organizationchoosing a winner before the voters have decided."

Proposed response is below:

On-the-record: "Now that we know who the Republican nominee, we are going to find ways to integrate the voices of both of our candidates for President into our efforts at the DNC. Our goal is to mobilize Democrats across the country and make sure our candidates up and down the ballot have the resources they need to win in November."

On background: NO, there is no new agreement. We reached out to both campaigns. The Sanders campaign preferred that the Organizationuse his prior statements on Trump, so last week we sent a similar email using his quotes. The only difference is that Hillary Clinton signed today's email.

Hi, y'all -

Just for context, I've pasted the three drafts below. These are the subject lines we're going to test:

I'm ready to beat Donald Trump, NAME - are you?
NAME, the whole world is counting on us

I'm ready to beat Donald Trump, NAME - are you?
I've never been prouder to be a Democrat

I'm ready to beat Donald Trump, NAME - are you?
NAME, I'm asking you to help

Amy signed off as well, and she spoke with the Chair about them just a moment ago.

Subject: [sample] I've never been prouder to be a Democrat

Keith --

The Republican Party has a new leader: Donald Trump. I can't think of a time in my life when I've been prouder to be a Democrat -- or more committed to building a strong party.

Consider Trump's stated goals for his first 100 days in office: He plans to undo some of President Obama's most important accomplishments, like the Affordable Care Act and executive orders on immigration, and he promises to appoint a Scalia-like justice to the Supreme Court to rip away our dearest progress, like marriage equality and a woman's right to choose.

Keith, we absolutely cannot let those things happen. We need to protect and build on President Obama's legacy -- for our shared values, and for the future of the country we love. Your $10 contribution to the Organization today will do just that -- can you help?

As Democrats, we have a very different vision for our country, from protecting LGBT people and public education at the state level to raising the minimum wage and confronting climate change as a nation. We know that there are no magic solutions -- we get things done by rolling up our sleeves and putting in hard work.

That starts with working to elect Democrats all across this country, to protect President Obama's legacy, and to make sure Donald Trump never, ever becomes president.

We can't win this fight without you, Keith. Chip in now -- the world is counting on us:

With deep thanks,

Hillary
