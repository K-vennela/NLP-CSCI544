** Trump challenges NYT
------------------------------------------------------------
Donald Trump says the "failing" NYT published a "false=2C malicious and li=
belous story" about his behavior around women to attack him. It was "total=
ly dishonest=2C" he says=2C and now the paper is "greatly embarrassed" bec=
ause the story has been "proven false."

Sunday's story (<<link>>
-women.html?mc_cid=3D9c847bf8b9&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) by Michael Barbaro and=
 Megan Twohey has not been proven false. The NYT is standing by it -- firm=
ly. But Trump has been able to sow doubt because the very first woman ment=
ioned in it=2C former girlfriend Rowanne Brewer Lane=2C went on Fox this m=
orning and said the NYT "spun" her words. She isn't disputing any of the s=
pecific quotes or asking for a correction=2C but her complaint -- repeated=
 on CNN later in the morning -- was enough for Trump to turn the tables on=
 the NYT. Dylan Byers and I wrote about his media strategy in detail here.=
=2E.  (<<link>>
?iid=3DLead&mc_cid=3D9c847bf8b9&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID])

s-treatment-of-women/?mc_cid=3D9c847bf8b9&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) the backlash=
 to the NYT storyis "laughable..." (<<link>>
rik-wemple/wp/2016/05/16/a-laughable-backlash-against-the-new-york-times-a=
rticle-on-trumps-treatment-of-women/?mc_cid=3D9c847bf8b9&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID=
])  and Chris Cillizza notes (<<link>>
b9&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) that "the more Trump can turn this NYT story on his=
 treatment of women into a debate over the Times=2C the better for him..."
Trump's domain.com threat
The phone rang in CNN's "New Day" control room around 7:20am. A producer p=
icked up. It was Trump. Nope=2C not an aide=2C not an impersonator=2Cit wa=
s the real Trump. (<<link>>
cle/index.html?iid=3DLead&mc_cid=3D9c847bf8b9&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) He wante=
d to make sure that the producers had seen Brewer Lane's interview on Fox.=
 As it turned out=2C they had=2C and they'd already been talking about how=
 to incorporate her comments onto the newscast. But for the producers=2C t=
he call was surreal... (<<link>>
ws-cycle/index.html?iid=3DLead&mc_cid=3D9c847bf8b9&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) Mor=
e evidence that Trump acts like his own publicist and thinks like a TV pro=
ducer...
Trump's domain.com threat  (He's bluffing=2C right?)
Trump's tweet calling the NYT story "libelous" was eyebrow raising. His bl=
uster about lawsuits is legendary. So we note this with skepticism: On "Er=
in Burnett OutFront=2C" Trump Organization assistant general counsel Jill=
 Martin said a domain.com against the NYT is "a distinct possibility:" "I haven'=
t talked to him about it personally=2C but=2C you know=2C when he's attack=
ed like that and things are said falsely=2C he definitely fires back=2C" s=
he said...
NYT getting the clicks
NYT's Theodore Kim tweets (<<link>>
65207808?mc_cid=3D9c847bf8b9&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) tonight: "Metrics are in:=
 The @nytimes article on Donald Trump's treatment of women is our most rea=
d story of the year..."
Up front with NBC and Fox
Today NBC kicked off "upfronts week" at Radio City with an NBCU-wide prese=
ntation=2C forgoing the usual night-by-night look at the network's fall sc=
hedule for a cable-heavy focus on shows divvied up by fan base and genre.=
 One such category: "Badasses."

Fox followed up a few hours later at the Beacon Theater with a more domain.com=
ional format. Frank Pallotta was at both=2C and he says one common theme (=
which will continue all week) were the shots fired at streaming services a=
nd other online rivals. Both NBC and Fox touted TV's reach over digital (N=
BC's tagline was "Reach Redefined") and called out the definition of onlin=
e "views." Fox's sales chief Toby Byrne even went as far to call digital v=
ideo "subprime." And his NBC counterpart Linda Yaccarino said "I don't car=
e what those Silicon Valley guys say. There is no algorithm for heart-pump=
ing=2C blood-racing breath-holding premium content."

I almost feel like the "Silicon Valley guys" should get a rebuttal at the=
 end of this week=E2=80=A6
"We cannot domain.com any longer"
Yaccarino's shot at Nielsen was also noteworthy... She promoted NBC's own=
 measurement and ad targeting tools and said this: "I don't run a measurem=
ent company... but I'm happy to do their jobs for them. Because we just ca=
nnot domain.com any longer... We cannot domain.com=2C and neither can all of you." THR=
 has more... (<<link>>

Brian Lowry's assessment
Fox is adapting "The Exorcist" and "Lethal Weapon=2C" reviving "Prison Bre=
ak=2C" and bringing back "24" without Kiefer Sutherland. NBC's slate inclu=
des a spin-off of "The Blacklist" and an extension of the "Taken" movies.

"The conservative playbook represents a response to a crowded media enviro=
nment. Programmers believe fewer new shows=2C with recognizable titles=2C=
 give them a better chance of standing out=2C" Brian Lowry writes. Fox TV=
 Group co-chair Dana Walden was honest about it today: These shows "don't=
 require the same marketing muscle as trying to introduce a brand-new conc=
ept=E2=80=A6"

=E2=80=94 But there's also this: Fox's "Shots Fired=2C" a limited series "=
devoted to a racially charged police shooting."

=E2=80=94 Noted: "24: Legacy=2C" with Corey Hawkins as the new Kiefer=2C "=
will get TV's best lead-in=2C premiering after the Super Bowl in February=
=E2=80=A6"
Lex Moonves!
He made an appearance at Fox's upfront... Gary Newman boast (<<link>>
domain.com/ditzkoff/status/732309733294678016?mc_cid=3D9c847bf8b9&mc_eid=3D[U=

_cid=3D9c847bf8b9&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) "this season=2C Gotham faced off aga=
inst its toughest foe=2C 'Lex Moonves...'"
NBC News gets a shoutout
Last year=2C in the wake of the Brian Williams scandal=2C there was no men=
tion of NBC News at the peacock's upfront. This year Steve Burke took time=
 to celebrate his news division=2C saying it's "#1 in the mornings=2C #1 i=
n the evenings=2C and #1 on the weekends." He cited Andy Lack's leadership=

BuzzFeed's Facebook fail
BuzzFeed had a big exclusive today: A sit-down with President Obama at the=
 White House=2C billed as the president's "first interview on Facebook Liv=
e." But it wasn't. Some sort of technical glitch (<<link>>
6/05/16/media/buzzfeed-obama-facebook-live-glitch/index.html?mc_cid=3D9c84=
7bf8b9&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) stopped BuzzFeed from live-streaming the interv=
iew at 2:55 p.m. Monday. Thankfully BF was simultaneously live-streaming i=
t on YouTube=2C so there was another way to watch. At deadline time=2C the=
re's still no official word on what went wrong. Here's my story... (http:/=

-- Hmmm... A source tells me that one of BuzzFeed Food's live streams ran=
 into trouble today=2C too...
First "Live" without Michael...
Special correspondent Jamie Stelter=2C a/k/a my wife=2C a/k/a the biggest=
 "Live with Kelly" fan I know=2C sends this along:

"Where's Michael?" That was Jimmy Kimmel's opening line to Kelly Ripa this=
 morning as he joined her as co-host for the newly named "Live with Kelly.=
" Of course we know where Michael Strahan is; he's in the dog house. (He l=
eft the show to join "GMA" full-time this fall.) Now the search for Kelly'=
s new co-host is officially underway! And Jimmy brought ideas. He had a wh=
eel she could spin featuring 7 possibilities=2C among them Kylie Jenner ("=
Kelly and Kylie has a nice ring to it") and Becky with the Good Hair (of B=
eyonce fame). Fun fact: Jimmy was also the first co-host the last time Kel=
ly was in this position=2C after Regis left the show in 2011. [[Editor's=
 note: Honey=2C how do you remember this?!]]

So who will get the gig this time? My reliable source at today's show tell=
s me that during a commercial break Kelly joked that executive producer Mi=
chael Gelman should become the new co-host so they don't to re-do all the=
 logos. Personally=2C I'm waiting for them to audition a woman...

This afternoon BuzzFeed's McKay Coppins reported (<<link>>

ki is "working on a book;" the denial came via Twitter shortly thereafter.=
 "Despite false reports to the contrary=2C I am not writing a book. I am u=
nder a strict confidentiality agreement with Mr. Trump=2C" he wrote.

Then came this... [[what word would you use for this?]]... followup tweet=
: "McKay Coppins also bet a year of his salary saying Mr. Trump would not=
 run for President. Mr. Trump is still waiting for the money." Coppins rep=
lied: "LOL." (He also denied (<<link>>
