f

Donald Trump may have skipped this past weekend's White House Correspondent=
's Dinner, but he probably felt hung over <--not sure if it matters but Tru=
mp doesn't drink after former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates took to the=
 airwaves yesterday to raise serious questions about the Republican candida=
te's grasp of foreign policy. On ABC's This Week, Gates criticized Dangerou=
s Donald's recent foreign policy speech saying Trump is someone "who doesn'=
t understand the difference between a business negotiation and a negotiatio=
n with sovereign powers," that he contradicts himself, and that he doesn't =
listen. The latter was described by the former Defense Secretary, military =
officer, and intelligence official as "one of the things that troubles" him=
 about Trump.

Gates' comments are a reminder that Dangerous Donald Trump lacks the judgme=
nt, experience, and temperament to be our next commander-in-chief. Dangerou=
s Donald would alienate allies and deal with friend and foe alike with reck=
less disregard, with poorly conceived ideas that would undermine our nation=
al security and make the American people less safe.

Watch to see what Robert Gates thinks of Dangerous Donald:

You heard Trump's foreign policy speech this week. Tell me what you believe=
 a Trump presidency would mean for the national security of this country? W=
