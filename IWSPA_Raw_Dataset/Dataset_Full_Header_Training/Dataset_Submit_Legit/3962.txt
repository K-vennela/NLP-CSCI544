 Dearfriends,   

 We did it! Yesterday, Gov. John Hickenlooper signed HB-1005 into law - legalizing residential rain barrels. After two years, a lot of work and good compromises, rain barrels earned strong bipartisan support from the legislature. I was so happy to work with my fellow sponsors, Rep. Daneya Esgar and Sen. Mike Merrifield, in order to pass this common sense water conservation measure. Thanks to the overwhelming support of the public, we were able to get this bill passed despite a lot of initial controversy.  

 Sincerely,



  Jessie Danielson
