We'd like replace the second bullet under the CBS poll with this bullet. Th=
e "note" in the new bullet indicates the problem that we don't have the rig=
ht data. It's a long bullet but it's factually correct. Thoughts?

=B7         The poll showed that more than 80 percent of Democrats would vo=
te for either Secretary Clinton or Senator Sanders in the general election.=
 According to an accompanying story in the New York Times, =93Democratic re=
sistance is less widespread than it was in the 2015 primary. While 72 perce=
nt of Mr. Sanders=92s supporters say they would vote for Mrs. Clinton this =
fall, a Times/CBS News survey taken in early May 2015 found that only 60 pe=
rcent of Mrs. Clinton=92s supporters said they would vote for Barack Obama =
in the general election.=94 [Note: neither the New York Times story nor the=
 poll itself provided what percentage of Secretary Clinton=92s supporters w=
ould vote for Senator Sanders if he became the nominee]

OrganizationTalking Points: Democrats Overwhelmingly United

Polls continue to show that Democrats are overwhelmingly united and excited=
 about both of our candidates.
By and large we=92ve had a great primary, with substantive candidates whose=
 vision to move America forward lines up with the values of the American pe=
ople.

And we=92re going to come out of our convention more unified and stronger t=
han ever, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with their da=
ngerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their party.

Just look at the new poll today from CBS/New York Times:

=B7         A new CBS/NYT poll<<<link>>

ndOfArticle&pgtype=3Darticle> shows that Democrats are more united today th=
an in May of 2008, disproving the myth of Democratic disunity heading into =
the 2015 election.

=B7         The poll showed that more than 80 percent of Democrats would vo=
te for either Secretary Clinton or Senator Sanders. 72 percent of Senator S=
anders=92 supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton, and 78 per=
cent of Secretary Clinton=92s supporters said they would vote for Senator S=
anders. In May of 2008, polling found only 60 percent of Clinton supporters=
 said they would vote for then-Senator Obama, who was eventually elected to=
 a landslide victory.

=B7         Furthermore, the poll shows that 80 percent of Democrats are =
=93mostly hopeful=94 about the future of the Democratic Party, as opposed t=
o Republicans, who are domain.com 55%-43% between =93mostly hopeful=94 and =93mo=
stly discouraged=94 about the future of the Republican Party.

This echoes what we=92ve seen in domain.com poll after domain.com poll after domain.com poll:

Indiana<<<link>>
-excited-republicans-are-divided/>:

=B7         Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they=92ve been ene=
rgized by the nomination contest between former Secretary of State Hillary =
Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But nearly 6 in 10 Republicans say=
 they think their party has been divided by the battle being fought by bill=
ionaire Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut<<<link>>

 in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut said their party was more energi=

New York<<<link>>

=B7         Almost 6 in 10 New York Republican voters say their party has b=
