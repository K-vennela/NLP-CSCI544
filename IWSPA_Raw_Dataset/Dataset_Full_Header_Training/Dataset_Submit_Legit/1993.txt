Hi,




                      We hope that you enjoyed the Africa Security
                        & Counter Terrorism domain.com 2014. Oliver
                      Kinross would like to thank you for your
                      participation which helped contributed towards
                      what was a fantastic first time event.

                      As you will remember I was speaking with all the
                      exhibitors during the event to see whether there
                      was interest in taking an on site discount for the
                      any of our events which are due to take place from
                      now until 2015 including the 2nd edition of the
                      Africa Security domain.com and the Caribbean South
                      America Security domain.com 2014.

                      Would you like to rebook for Africa Security
                        2015 event with an 8% discount until
                      Friday 7th March?Â  

                      Any questions please do not hesitate to contact
                      me. I look forward to hearing back from you.

                      Kind regards,
