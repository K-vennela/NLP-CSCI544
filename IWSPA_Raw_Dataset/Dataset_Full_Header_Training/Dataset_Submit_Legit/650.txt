Hi User,

As a leader within DNC, I wanted to extend a personal invitation to join our webinar tomorrow, May 12, Your Glassdoor Profile: How to Use it to Your Advantage. We will dive into how to use your Glassdoor profile to showcase your brand and how this can positively impact decisions by candidates and consumers.

Katie Burke, Vice President of Culture and Experience at HubSpot, will share how they have leveraged their Glassdoor profile to enhance their brand, attract the right candidates, and ultimately grow their business as a whole.

If you are interested in attending, please register here <<<link>>>. We would love for you to join us!

Best,

Katie Williams | Glassdoor <<<link>>>
