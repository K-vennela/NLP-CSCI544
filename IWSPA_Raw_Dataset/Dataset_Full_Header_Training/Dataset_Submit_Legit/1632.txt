The presumptive nominee seeks to exert control over the Republican Party.

Donald Trump's campaign is hashing out the details of an agreement with Rep=
ublican Party leaders that could allow the presumptive GOP presidential nom=
inee to raise six-figure checks for his presidential campaign, multiple sou=
rces with direct knowledge of the negotiations tell POLITICO.

The fundraising agreement was among the subjects discussed at a Monday meet=
ing at the Republican National Committee's Washington offices between top R=
NC officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, and senior Trump aides, in=
cluding campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, senior adviser Paul Manafort an=
d political director Rick Wiley, according to the sources.

The talks represent the first formal steps towards a merger between the off=
icial apparatus of the Republican Party and a candidate who many party lead=
ers scorned until recently, and about whom there remains deep leeriness in =
some Republican quarters.

Since Trump essentially clinched the GOP nomination with a win in last week=
's Indiana primary, his staff have moved quickly to put their stamp on the =
party's general election planning process. Wiley has paid several visits to=
 the party's headquarters on Capitol Hill to assess its efforts, according =
to the sources. The campaign also has been discussing convention-related is=
sues with the RNC, including credentials and rules, the sources said, addin=
g that the campaign is expected in the coming days to formally deputize a s=
taffer as a liaison to the national party committee.

And deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner this week is set to lead a del=
egation to the convention site, Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena, to receive=
 a briefing from RNC officials involved in planning for the July event, as =
POLITICO first reported<<<link>>
michael-glassner-convention-222878> last week.

Fundraising was not a major focus of Monday's meetings, according to RNC se=
nior strategist Sean Spicer. "It was 3 =BD hours on briefings from all the =
RNC divisions regarding the capabilities and resources that we have been co=
mpiling to win in November," said Spicer, who attended the meeting, and sai=
d it included presentations on the party's ground game, and its data, commu=
nications and research efforts.

The conversations are also partly an effort to lay the groundwork for a Thu=
rsday meeting in Washington between Trump, Priebus and House Speaker Paul R=
yan, who announced last Thursday that he is withholding his endorsement unt=
il Trump outlines a stronger commitment to conservative principles.

The perception among Trump's inner circle is that Ryan is attempting to lev=
erage his position as chairman of the Cleveland convention into securing a =
deal that protects the party's control over vendor contracts and how the mo=
ney raised jointly by the party and Trump's campaign is spent.

"Trump is a tough negotiator, understands the history of what he's entitled=
 to here," another Trump confidant said. "They want the RNC to be autonomou=
s but they'll work with the Trump campaign. They need Trump to help raise t=
he money but they want their vendors to be the ones to spend the money."

But Trump may be more reliant on the national party than past presidential =
nominees, since his campaign has invested relatively little in field staff,=
 voter data or a fundraising operation.

Some of Trump's infrastructure deficiencies can be traced to his unwillingn=
ess to dig deep into his own fortune to finance his campaign, which he has =
pledged from the beginning to self-finance.

Entering into a joint fundraising agreement and leaning on the party for ca=
sh and staff would help fill that void in an election expected to cost each=
 side more than $1 billion. But it also could undermine his rhetoric about =
being independent from the party's donor class.

Trump has already agreed to appear next week at a $25,000 per-plate fundrai=
ser to domain.com the New Jersey Republican Party, just days after the New Yor=
k billionaire tapped Gov. Chris Christie to run his presidential transition=
.

The May 19 event is being billed as a "roundtable" with Christie and Trump,=
 and will be held at the Lawrenceville National Guard Armory, according to =
an invitation obtained by POLITICO. Just 12 people will be permitted to att=
end the roundtable, according to a note sent with the invitation.

The RNC has been taking the lead in reaching out to state parties to put to=
gether the joint fundraising arrangement with Trump's campaign, and its pla=
ns are actually further along than they were at this point four years ago, =
said one source familiar with the negotiations.

"I know (the Trump campaign staff) have been impressed with what the RNC al=
ready has on the ground," said the source. "Four years ago, when Romney wal=
ked into the building, the RNC didn't have anywhere close to the field staf=
f that it has now. ... There is a big difference."

Yet efforts to finalize the agreement also could test the willingness of st=
ate GOP officials to get behind a presumptive nominee who some official ope=
nly opposed during the contentious primary.

Colorado's state party appeared to gloat last month after Trump's vanquishe=
d rival Ted Cruz swept all 34 delegate slots at the state's caucus. "We did=
 it. #NeverTrump," the state party tweeted, only to delete and disavow<http=
://domain.com/story/2016/04/colorado-gop-nevertrump-tweet-221766> the=
 post minutes later.

Party spokesman Kyle Kohli on Monday said the Colorado GOP hasn't had any t=
alks with Trump or the RNC about a joint fundraising agreement.

The South Carolina Republican Party is open to participating but hasn't eng=
aged in any talks yet, said the chairman, Matt Moore.

The more state parties that participate, the more money a Trump joint fundr=
aising committee can accept, thanks in part to a 2015 Supreme Court case ca=
lled McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission<<<link>>
y/2014/04/mccutcheon-supreme-court-ruling-105303>. It struck down aggregate=
 limits on total giving to federal campaigns, allowing maximum donations to=
 as many different committees as a donor wanted.

Trump's likely general election opponent, Hillary Clinton, created an unpre=
cedented joint fundraising committee<<<link>>
clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670> with the Democr=
atic National Committee and 32 state party committees that can accept check=
s as large as $356,100 this year.

Early in the election cycle, the talk among GOP state party officials was o=
f a joint fundraising committee that could include all 50 states and six te=
rritories, allowing maximum donations of about $1 million per person, accor=
ding to one state party chairman. But those talks quieted as Trump's surpri=
sing rise threw the GOP primary into chaos, said the chairman.

Sources with knowledge of the RNC's current plans said its joint fundraisin=
g arrangement would include between four and 12 state committees, which cou=
ld allow the committee to accept checks ranging from $78,800 and $158,000.
The joint committee could help Trump's campaign as well as the RNC, which h=
as struggled to keep its finances intact. The committee ended March with ju=
st $16 million on hand and nearly $2 million in outstanding debt. Taken tog=
ether, the bank account is a fraction of where the committee had been at si=
milar points in 2015 and 2012.
Many Republican state party chairs, who depend on the RNC to fund a get-out=
-the-vote program, are anxious to see Trump and the committee form an agree=
ment.

"We are a battleground state and we can expect a lot of money to support ou=
r push," said Rob Gleason, the Pennsylvania GOP chair. "We already were get=
ting a lot of money from the RNC, but we need a lot more."
"Trump should be able to get us up to speed," he added.
