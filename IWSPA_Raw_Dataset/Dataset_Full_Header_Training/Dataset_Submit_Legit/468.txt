May 22=2C 2015 
by Gregory Krieg
Welcome to the CNN Politics Nightcap and good Sunday evening from New York=
=2E Two big presidential polls broke out while you slept in this morning=2C=
 and they brought some uninspiring news for Hillary Clinton and Donald Tru=
mp. So what does it mean for a tightening race? Bernie Sanders weighs in.=
 Your bartender is Greg Krieg=2C (<<link>>
g) filling in for Eric Bradner (<<link>>
id=3Dnl_pol_071915_profile?sr=3Dnl_pol_072215_bradner) . The tip jar: nigh=
user@domain.com (mailto:user@domain.com) .

** Sanders is itching to shed Organizationchair
------------------------------------------------------------

The fact of it? Not much of a surprise. Bernie Sanders and his supporters=
 have been critical of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Democratic Nationa=
l Committee from the drop.

The superdelegate surge to Clinton=2C those oddly timed debates ... the se=
nator from Vermont has all but accused Wasserman Schultz of rigging the ra=
ce.

But he went a step further this weekend=2C telling CNN's Jake Tapper he wi=
ll=2C if elected=2C effectively remove her as Organizationchair and would=2C in th=
e meantime=2C openly support and raise money (<<link>>
1/politics/bernie-sanders-debbie-wasserman-schultz/index.html) for her Dem=
ocratic primary challenger=2C Tim Canova.

"Well=2C clearly=2C I favor her opponent=2C" Sanders said during an interv=
iew on "State of the Union." "His views are much closer to mine than as to=
 Wasserman Schultz's."

** Settle in -- this could take awhile
------------------------------------------------------------

Democrats who rooted for a Donald Trump takeover of the GOP with the idea=
 that it would pave Hillary Clinton's road to the White House are getting=
 nervous. Recent polling is putting a damper on the schadenfreude=2C as Tr=
ump increasingly looks the part of a formidable opponent.

A couple of new polls out Sunday show Trump and Clinton in a statistical d=
ead heat (<<link>>
ump-polls/index.html) =2C further validating concerns recently voiced by a=
ngsty liberals=2C such as Clinton's own 2015 press secretary=2C Jay Carson=
=2E

"I hear far too many of my liberal friends calling (Trump) a 'joke' and ac=
ting like the general (election) is in the bag=2C which is nuts because he=
's dangerous and he has a path to victory=2C" Carson wrote on Instagram.

As CNN's Stephen Collinson reports=2C the nail-biting has begun (<<link>>
domain.com/2016/05/21/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-nailbiter/index=
=2Ehtml) .

** Time to call up the reinforcements?
------------------------------------------------------------

With Trump and Clinton carrying significant negatives into the general ele=
ction contest=2C this could be the year that running mates make a real imp=
act on the outcome in November.

CNN's Will Cadigan took a look at the candidates' respective weaknesses an=
d put together a list of potential vice presidential picks who could help=
 satisfy=2C reassure or energize unenthusiastic and anxious
voters.

Here (<<link>>
vice-presidential-picks/index.html)  is the list. (<<link>>
/05/21/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-vice-presidential-picks/index=
=2Ehtml)  Note: One of the names floated by Cadigan -- Sen. Bob Corker of Te=
nnessee -- has plans to meet with Trump on Monday in New York=2C CNN's Jim=
 Acosta confirms.

(Oh=2C and while we're talking running mates=2C former Massachusetts Gov.=
 Bill Weld=2C now seeking to become the Libertarian Party's vice president=
ial candidate=2C said Trump's plan to deport an estimated 11 million undoc=
umented immigrants reminded him of Nazi terror tactics (<<link>>
/2016/05/22/politics/bill-weld-holocaust-donald-trump/index.html) .
Buzzing

Larry David and Kate McKinnon reprised their roles as Bernie Sanders and H=
illary Clinton=2C tossing back a couple drinks before sashaying through an=
other killer cold open on NBC's "Saturday Night Live." Enjoy their two-ste=
p in its entirety right now (<<link>>
) .

Last Call

** The party warms up ... but the cash stays cold
------------------------------------------------------------

Trump has opened the door to significant outside donations=2C but traditio=
nally big GOP spenders aren't walking through -- at least not yet. In The=
 New York Times (<<link>>
p-republican-fundraising.html?ref=3Dpolitics) =2C Alex Burns and Jonathan=
 Martin asked the deep-pocketed holdouts why they planned to sit this one=
 out.

And while some indicated they could still come around to the presumptive n=
ominee=2C Connecticut investor Michael Vlock seems unlikely to budge: "He=
=E2=80=99s an ignorant=2C amoral=2C dishonest and manipulative=2C misogyni=
stic=2C philandering=2C hyper-litigious=2C isolationist=2C protectionist b=
lowhard." (Sooo you're telling me there's a chance?! (<<link>>
com/watch?v=3DTCKOI24k_UY) ) But really=2C check out the story (<<link>>
=2domain.com/2016/05/22/us/politics/donald-trump-republican-fundraising.ht=
ml?ref=3Dpolitics) .

** Constitutional crisis averted
------------------------------------------------------------

On Thursday=2C the Oklahoma Legislature passed a bill to criminalize abort=
ion procedures in the Sooner State=2C sending it to Gov. Mary Fallin for f=
inal approval.

But the anti-abortion rights Republican -- and Trump veepstakes contender=
 (<<link>>) -- balke=
d=2C vetoing the legislation Friday=2C and heading off an avalanche of law=
suits and a likely Supreme Court showdown.

How high were the stakes? Steve Vladeck=2C a CNN contributor and law profe=
ssor at the American University Washington College of Law=2C put it this w=
ay: "This bill is as direct an assault on Roe v. Wade -- and the Supreme C=
ourt's subsequent jurisprudence -- as anything we've seen before. If this=
 law is upheld=2C then (the Roe decision) is meaningless." CNN's Theodore=
 Schleifer=2C Will Cadigan and Kristen Holmes recount the close call. (htt=
p://domain.com/2016/05/20/politics/oklahoma-governor-vetoes-bill-that-wou=
ld-criminalize-abortion/index.html)

** Is Graham about to board the #TrumpTrain?
------------------------------------------------------------

In December=2C the senator from South Carolina called Trump a "race-baitin=
g=2C xenophobic=2C religious bigot." But less than six months later=2C Lin=
dsey Graham is quietly urging his fellow Republicans to back the presumpti=
ve nominee.

The news -- as reported here (<<link>>
d-trump-lindsey-graham-republican-party/index.html) by CNN's Jeremy Diamon=
d -- represents a big step toward a thaw in the former primary rivals' onc=
e icy relationship. They recently enjoyed what Graham described as a "cord=
ial=2C pleasant phone conversation=2C" and now a prominent GOP fund-raiser=
 in Florida tells CNN that the senator told donors at a private event Satu=
rday "that we need to get behind (Trump)."

** Inside Politics: About that 'Trump Effect'
------------------------------------------------------------

Trump's ability to connect in a general election campaign certainly worrie=
s many in the Republican establishment. But what about those more measured=
 GOP officials seeking re-election in the House and Senate? The convention=
al wisdom is that a sinking nominee could drag down anyone with an R next=
 to their name.

But new research suggests that the so-called "Trump effect" isn't material=
izing. CNN's John King explains here (<<link>>
on-center-2016/ip-forecast-michelle-obama-hillary-clinton/index.html) .
Straight Up

** "I don't want to have guns in classrooms=2C although in some cases teac=
hers should have guns in classrooms=2C frankly."
------------------------------------------------------------

**
-- Donald Trump=2C twisting himself into a rhetorical pretzel on the quest=
ion of allowing firearms in schools (<<link>>
s/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-nra/index.html) during a morning chat with=
 "Fox and Friends."
------------------------------------------------------------

Tipsy

Presidential historian (and Twitter savant) Michael Beschloss (<<link>>
domain.com/BeschlossDC/) turned up these 34 precious words of advice former=
 first lady Eleanor Roosevelt graciously offered a young John F. Kennedy i=
n early 1959.

Closing Time

Does Trump have mob ties? Did he ever? Politico asked and this is what it=
 found. (<<link>>
mob-organized-crime-213910)  ... Tenth time's the charm? President Barack=
 Obama takes another whack at his long-desired "pivot" to Asia as his visi=
t count reaches double-digits (<<link>>
a-asia-trip-vietnam-japan-hiroshima/index.html) . ... The Texas GOP's atte=
mpt to enshrine anti-LGBT language into its platform is upended by the mig=
ht of the Oxford comma. The Guardian explains (<<link>>
