Haven't found something with "all time" phrasing yet - here are a few articles, trying to find some more:

Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Tenure In Florida's State Legislature "Established Her As One Of The Most Liberal Politicians In The State." "Wasserman Schultz's tenure in Florida's state legislature - eight years in the House and four years in Senate - established her as one of the most liberal politicians in the state.  She was an advocate for legislation protecting women's rights, seniors, and children, including legislation requiring gender price parity for dry cleaning and ensuring an equal number of men and women were appointed to state boards." [Cloture Club, March 2011<<<link>>>]

Debbie Wasserman Schultz Was "One Of The [Florida] Legislature's Most Liberal Members." "Debbie Wasserman Schultz went on to serve eight years in the state house, including a term as house Democratic leader pro tempore, house Democratic floor leader, and chair of the Broward legislative delegation. From 1994 to 1996, she chaired the house Committee on Higher Education. Term-limited in 2000, she ran for and won a seat in the Florida State Senate. During her dozen years in Tallahassee, Wasserman Schultz was one of the legislature's most liberal members." [The Jews of Capitol Hill: A Compendium of Jewish Congressional Members, 12/29/10<<<link>>+wasserman+one+of+the+most+liberal+members+florida+state+legislature&source=bl&ots=5k-QpDtGHa&sig=mDsxV9SE6U_6oVc1H_62ExTXZUE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjtlZiq99nMAhUTID4KHTiNAFQQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&q=debbie%20wasserman%20one%20of%20the%20most%20liberal%20members%20florida%20state%20legislature&f=false>]

Debbie Wasserman Schultz Had A Reputation As "One Of The Most Liberal Members" Of Florida's Legislature. "She pushed for a law that would have forced dry cleaners to charge the same rates for

cleaning women's clothes as men's and authored another bill requiring that each state board be comprised of equal numbers of men and women. When she proposed a measure mandating gender neutral language in all state statutes, her colleagues gave her a nickname that even she had to domain.com was funny: 'Wasserperson.' Her strong support for the gay community and for abortion rights helped to cement her reputation as one of the most liberal members of the legislature. But she reached across the aisle to win passage of a swimming pool safety bill and appealed to a broader constituency with her dogged fight for smaller class sizes. In 1996, she and other south Florida Jewish leaders successfully lobbied Governor Lawton Chiles to veto an education bill that would have allowed voluntary student led prayer at graduations, assemblies and sporting events."

Can research find an article or clip from the 90's (or whenever) about DWS being called something like "the most liberal legislator of all time?"
