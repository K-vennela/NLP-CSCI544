WASHINGTON - OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the following statement in response to April's January's jobs report that showed 160,000 new jobs created74 straight months of private-sector job growth, an increase in average hourly earnings at an annual rate of 3.2% so far this year, and a decline in the number of long-term unemployed by 150,000:

"April's jobs report is more proof that the hard work being done by President Obama and Congressional Democrats to rebuild the economy after the Great Recession is paying off. There is no denying that 74 straight months of private-sector job growth - the longest stretch on record - is progress that American workers and families can count on. More importantly, this month's report showed a strong increase in wages, which hardworking families need and deserve, and a large drop in the number of long-term unemployed. We still have a lot of work to do to strengthen middle-class and working families, but it's clear that the economy has undergone a remarkable turnaround from where we were seven years ago.

"This concrete progress also offers a stark contrast to what Donald Trump has promised to do as president. His reckless plans would hurt working families, destabilize our economy, and drag our country back to where we were when the last Republican president left office - losing 800,000 jobs a month. Dangerous Donald's real-life record is already riddled with embarrassing failures and cheap schemes designed to turn a quick buck at the expense of everyday Americans. We cannot afford to let him do the same thing from the Oval Office.

"We need a forward-looking president leader in the Oval Office who will build on the progress we've already made and who will ensure that we have an economy that works for everyone - not just the wealthy few. We must elect a Democrat as our next president."
