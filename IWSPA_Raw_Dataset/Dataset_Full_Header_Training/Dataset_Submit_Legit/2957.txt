Hi all - This week, we're going to start supporting volunteer recruitment for battleground state coordinated campaigns. Below are a few templates that we'll use for :

  *   General volunteer recruitment
  *   Canvasses and phone banks
  *   Office openings
  *   Internship/Fellowship recruitment
Each send using these template will link to pages on a new Victory 2015 site we are building for the coordinated campaigns (e.g. <<link>>) unless otherwise cleared with legal.

Please let me know if there are any questions or edits with these.

Thanks,
Eric

It's pretty simple, NAME(really): The more people vote, the more Democrats win elections.

So between this moment and November 8th, our top priority is to make sure we knock on every door in communities all across STATE to make sure our neighbors know about every race on the ballot, are registered to vote, and are ready to get out and support Democrats. <LINK>NAME, can you help?<LINK>

Up and down the ballot, we can beat Republicans and elect Democrats if we work together -- <LINK>so I'm asking you to make a commitment and volunteer to help us keep STATE and our country moving forward.</LINK>

Sign up today, and a member of our State Victory Team will touch base and let you know how you can start making a difference:

We're glad you're on the team, NAME!

Friend --

Our right to vote is one of the most important duties and liberties we have as Americans -- so whenever we get the chance to help our neighbors here in STATE make their voices heard, we need to take advantage of it.

And we really need to make the most out of every hour in every day if we're going to reach every potential supporter. So we're looking for folks like you from all across STATE to come out and help us reach every potential supporter so we can beat Republicans up and down the ballot.

So, NAME, add your name to sign up for a canvassing/phone banking shift in your neighborhood this weekend:

Hey there, NAME -

It's an exciting time to be a STATE Democrat! With Donald Trump at the top of the Republican ticket, we've got a great opportunity to turn/keep our state blue and elect Democrats up and down the ticket in November.

But it's going to take a lot of hard work to get there. So we're looking for energetic, hardworking folks to join STATE Victory 2015 - the official campaign to support every Democratic candidate in 2015 - as Summer Organizing Fellow/Interns.
