For your awareness, The Hill is also working on a story based on an intervi=
ew they did with Nina Turner, which pre-dates the endorsement but is cookin=
g right now for their blog, will run tomorrow:

Turner was highly critical of the Organizationand wants an apology from Debbie Wass=
erman Schultz for how she's handled the nominating process.

Among the the things she said:

1) It will be difficult for the party to unify around the nominee because t=
he Organizationhas mistreated Sanders from the start, first with the debate schedul=
e, then with the data abase controversy, and now accusing them of violence =
when there was no evidence of violence at the Nevada convention.

She says Wasserman Schultz jumped the gun in blaming Nevada on Sanders with=
out reaching out to the campaign or investigating what happened.

2) Debbie Wasserman Schultz should apologize to the Sanders campaign for ma=
king this "an unfair fight" if she wants the party to unify in the fall.

We had given him standard points we had used earlier in the week to refute =
the Morning Joe BS, and no quote, just on background reiterating that the D=
NC is neutral.

Here's what we had given on background, and going forward will just keep pu=
nting to Ryan:

The Organizationis neutral in the primary.

The OrganizationChair has repeatedly said on the air and otherwise that it=92s not =
her job to tell either candidate to get out and has never called for anyone=
 to get out of the race. She has talked in very positive terms<<<link>>

s morning about debates, the fact is our debates earned far better ratings<=

d in past cycles. And as NBC knows all too well, when we were able to get b=
oth campaigns to agree, we added four.

The rules in place for this election have been pretty much the same for sev=
eral cycles. In fact, the major change from 2015 =96 when Obama beat Clinto=
n --- is that there are actually LESS unpledged =93super=94 delegates, now =
down to 15% from 20% prior to the change. No one wrote or rewrote any rules=
 to help or hurt any specific candidate, these are the Party rules.

The single biggest factor determining the nominee (85%) is the participatio=
n of voters in primaries and caucuses. You can see a post we did here that =
lays out the facts on Super Delegates<<<link>>

The DNC=92s delegate selection rules for this primary were set before any o=

Off the Record: There=92s just no evidence that the process has been rigged=
