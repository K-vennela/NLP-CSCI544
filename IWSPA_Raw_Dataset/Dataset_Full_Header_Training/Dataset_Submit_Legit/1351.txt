Measuring for Value Webcast

The Institute for Law Department Excellence (ILDETM), invites you to join Kia Motors, Lex Machina and ReInvent Law for an informative dialog entitled..."Measuring for Value: Addressing the Challenges in Measuring Performance Quality In and Outside of the Corporate Law Department."

As law departments seek to reduce their legal spend, the question is how to optimize the trade-off between cost and benefits. This requires ever sophisticated metrics in order to be successful. The problem is that truly measuring attorney and vendor quality and performance is perhaps the most difficult measurement problem facing the industry.
