Hi everyone,

Starting today, User would like all interviews from DWS, Mark, or User, to have YouTube Links tweeted out from @dncpress within 30 minutes of when the interviews air. To speed up this process, we would like YouTube links (on Organizationclips) to be sent with the vantage link to comm_d in reply to the video request.

The title of the links can all be in this format:

OrganizationChair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on (NETWORK NAME) (SHOW NAME)
OrganizationNational Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach on (NETWORK NAME) (SHOW NAME)
OrganizationCommunications Director User on (NETWORK NAME) (SHOW NAME)

After I receive the links, I will send them around to the twitter approval chain.

Please chat with User if you have questions. Thanks! I really appreciate it.

Rachel
