Key Vote Alert: House Democrats Fighting GOP=92s Agenda of
Discrimination & Intolerance

Republicans in Congress are acting shocked that the forces of intolerance, =
bigotry and narrow-mindedness have risen to the top of their Party.  But th=
e reality is that, time and time again, this Republican Congress has worked=
 to turn discrimination into legislation.  Sadly, Republicans have doubled =
down on this agenda of discrimination and intolerance in the Defense Author=
ization bill.

In a dead-of-night markup, Republicans added a radical amendment that would=
 effectively overturn President Obama=92s historic executive order protecti=
ng LGBT workers in federal contracts, therefore enabling discrimination wit=
h taxpayer funds.  In the same markup, they acted to ensure that a prominen=
t, taxpayer-funded American military school continues to fly the symbol of =
hate that is the Confederate Battle Flag.

We=92ve seen a lot of empty talk from Republicans about being shocked at th=
e hateful and divisive ideas from Donald Trump =96 but let=92s see if their=
 votes match their rhetoric.

House Democrats=92 Motion to domain.com, offered by Assistant Democratic Lead=
er James Clyburn and Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, would reject the dis=
criminatory actions of House Republicans in the NDAA.  The Democratic MTR w=
ould allow a final amendment that would:

=B7         Strike Republicans=92 extreme attempt to target LGBT Americans =
for discrimination, and

=B7         domain.com the Confederate Battle Flag from flying over The Citad=
el or any other institution that trains military officers with taxpayer mon=
ey.

It is long past time for House Republicans to actually rise up against thei=
r Party=92s appalling agenda of discrimination and intolerance =96 instead =
of just talking about it.  House Republicans should reevaluate their radica=
lism, and join with Democrats to protect the security and equality of all A=
mericans.
