ELECTION CLIPS

2016 - Presidential

Democratic Party Candidates

Hillary Clinton

Pulling Away From Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton Is Turning to the Fall<ht=
tp://domain.com/2016/04/27/us/politics/democratic-race-sanders-clinton=
.html>

After months of trying to sideline an unexpectedly deft and well-financed l=
iberal opponent, Hillary Clinton on Tuesday won a series of primaries that =
freed her to present herself as the de facto victor of the Democratic nomin=
ating fight and gave her the impetus to shift focus decisively toward the N=
ovember election. Now all but certain to clinch her party's nomination, Mrs=
. Clinton will continue to face the criticism of her party rival, Senator B=
ernie Sanders of Vermont. But she is expected to move swiftly to claim an e=
arly advantage against the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump. H=
er advisers and allies say she will spend the coming weeks honing her messa=
ge for the general election, and stepping up fund-raising that has lagged i=
n the face of Mr. Sanders's challenge.

Bernie Sanders

Plan B for Bernie Sanders: Make the Democratic Party platform more progress=
ive<<<link>>
-sanders-make-democratic-party-platform-more-progressive/83558806/>

The results of Tuesday's five Democratic presidential primaries will almost=
 certainly force Sen. Bernie Sanders to acknowledge a hard reality -- it's =
time for Plan B. Sanders hasn't said if he has a strategy for changing the =
focus of his campaign, and he insists he'll continue fighting through the l=
ast contest in June. But rather than insisting that victory over Hillary Cl=
inton is still within reach, he said after Tuesday's contests that he'll go=
 to the Democratic Party's national convention in July "with as many delega=
tes as possible to fight for a progressive party platform."

Republican Party Candidates

Ted Cruz

Ted Cruz Needs Indiana to Be Like Wisconsin<<<link>>
-cruz-needs-indiana-to-be-like-wisconsin-1461714557>

For Ted Cruz to stop Donald Trump from seizing the Republican presidential =
nomination, he must replicate his Wisconsin victory in Indiana, another Mid=
western state with similar demographics and population. But even with Ohio =
Gov. John Kasich's ceding Indiana to him as part of a nonaggression pact, i=
t's a tall hurdle.

John Kasich

Congressman Charlie Dent Throws Support Behind John Kasich<<<link>>
domain.com/2016/04/25/charlie-dent-supports-john-kasich>

Pennsylvania and four other states go to the polls Tuesday. In the Keystone=
 State, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are ahead in the polls. Here & Now=
's Jeremy Hobson speaks with Republican Congressman Charlie Dent, who is su=
pporting John Kasich.

Donald Trump

No, Donald Trump, beating Hillary Clinton will not be easy for you<<<link>>
domain.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/04/27/no-donald-trump-be=
ating-hillary-clinton-will-not-be-easy-for-you/>

Following a five-primary sweep Tuesday night, Donald Trump repeatedly insis=
ted that he would beat Hillary Clinton "so easily," because she is a crooke=
d politician and a flawed candidate whom people do not like. It is undoubte=
dly true that Clinton is beatable. By her own admission, she is "not a natu=
ral politician." But that does not mean that Trump can beat her, let alone =
easily.

2016 - Senate

Arizona

John McCain Put on His Maverick domain.com to Take on the Worst Defense Project i=
n Years<<<link>>
in-f-35/>

Like hanging, a tough re-election tends to concentrate the mind. Out in Ari=
zona, John McCain is getting a serious run from Democratic Congresswoman An=
n Kirkpatrick. (Arizona being Arizona, McCain also is bedeviled by a primar=
y challenge from Kelli Ward, a former state senator and yet another in what=
 seems to be an endless roster of wingnut physicians. Ward once held a town=
 hall meeting to encourage debate on the threat of chemtrails.

California

California: U.S. Senate candidates' debate spotlights styles of Kamala Harr=
is, Loretta Sanchez<<<link>>
ornia-u-s-senate-candidates-debate-spotlights-styles>

What they lacked in policy distinctions the two Democrats vying for Califor=
nia's first open U.S. Senate seat in decades made up for in stylistic diffe=
rences, with front-runner Attorney General Kamala Harris sticking to an att=
orney's measured tones and Rep. Loretta Sanchez shooting from the hip and m=
ilking every moment for a quip. In Monday night's debate, Harris and Sanche=
z agreed on the need to create path to citizenship for people living in the=
 United States illegally, on restricting access to weapons for those with a=
 criminal record or history of mental illness and on the need to provide fr=
ee community college education.

Colorado

Keyser argues over rejected signature petitions for Senate race; ruling by =
Friday<<<link>>
retary-states-ballot-denial-u-s-senate-race/>

Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Jon Keyser on Tuesday challenged his disqual=
ification from Colorado's GOP primary, seeking a court order that would put=
 his name on the June ballot. The former state representative and one-time =
favorite to challenge Democratic Sen. Michael domain.com argued that Secretary =
of State Wayne Williams erroneously rejected voter signatures that Keyser n=
eeded to make the primary. Denver District Court Judge Elizabeth Starrs sai=
d after a hearing she would have a ruling by Friday.

Florida

A Debate Where the Voters Pick the Questions<<<link>>
itics/archive/2016/04/a-debate-where-the-voters-pick-the-questions/479958/>

When Alan Grayson faced off against David Jolly on Monday night in the firs=
t debate in the race for the Florida Senate seat being vacated by Marco Rub=
io, the match-up was unique in a couple of ways. For one, Grayson, a Democr=
at, and Jolly, a Republican, haven't even won their parties' nominations ye=
t. The primaries aren't until August-the latest in the country for congress=
ional seats-and there are a handful of other serious candidates in the race=
. But the more notable twist in Monday's debate was the questions themselve=
s: They were posted online in advance for all to see, having been determine=
d, for the most part, by more than 400,000 votes from domain.com users, inclu=
ding more than 84,000 in Florida.

Indiana

Tea Party group endorses Stutzman for Indiana senate<<<link>>
gs/ballot-box/senate-races/277675-tea-party-group-endorses-stutzman-for-ind=
iana-senate>

Another major Tea Party group has backed Rep. Marlin Stutzman's (R-Ind.) in=
surgent bid for Indiana's Senate seat just one week before the GOP primary.=
  Tea Party Express on Tuesday announced their endorsement, calling Stutzma=
n the best choice for the grassroots. Stutzman is facing fellow Republican =
Rep. Todd Young in the primary. "The Indiana Senate race is a clear example=
 where the politicians and lobbyists in Washington have picked one candidat=
e while the grassroots of Indiana have picked another candidate," executive=
 director Taylor Budowich said in a statement.

Louisiana

Boustany, Fleming with big $ lead in Louisiana's U.S. Senate race to replac=
e Vitter<<<link>>
-lead-in-louisiana-s-u-s-senate-race-to-replace-vitter>

The race for the open Louisiana U.S. Senate seat will be an expensive one. =
 Incumbent U.S. Sen. David Vitter decided not to seek a third term.  There =
will be a long list of candidates from both parties on the ballot this Nove=
mber, but presently the attention is centered around six, who are considere=
d major candidates.

Maryland

Van Hollen defeats Edwards in heated Maryland primary for U.S. Senate<https=
://domain.com/local/md-politics/2016/04/26/ad03cdf4-0bbc-11e6-b=
fa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html>

Rep. Chris Van Hollen won a hard-fought Senate primary that exposed racial =
and gender divisions within the Maryland Democratic Party, defeating Rep. D=
onna F. Edwards for the nomination. He will compete in November for a rare =
open Senate seat, from which Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D) is retiring after=
 30 years. African American turnout reached record levels, exceeding 2008, =
when Barack Obama first ran for president, and outnumbering white voters, a=
ccording to domain.com polls. Yet the candidate who would have been Maryland's fi=
rst black senator and the second black woman to ever serve in the U.S. Sena=
te fell short.

New Hampshire

Networks Blackout Hassan Scandal<<<link>>
ackout-hassan-scandal/>

National news networks have ignored the sex scandal that has dominated head=
lines in the New Hampshire Senate race, a Washington Free Beacon analysis f=
ound. The Boston Globe's March revelation that Gov. Maggie Hassan's husband=
 Tom hushed up a sexual misconduct scandal while working as principal of th=
e Phillips Exeter Academy has stirred controversy in the Granite State.

Ohio

Republican donor backs clean energy senators with digital campaign<<<link>>
domain.com/article/us-usa-election-republican-climatechange-idUSKCN0XO1=
6S>

A Republican political donor said on Wednesday he would spend "seven figure=
s" on a targeted digital campaign backing two senators who support clean en=
ergy policies, which could help tip the balance in their tight November re-=
election races. Jay Faison, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based executive of =
an audio-vision equipment company, said he would endorse Republican Senator=
 Rob Portman of Ohio and Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire for re-elect=
ion. Portman is a co-sponsor of a bipartisan energy efficiency bill, while =
Ayotte is one of the only Republican supporters of President Barack Obama's=
 plan to cut carbon emissions.

Pennsylvania

Establishment favorite McGinty wins big in Pennsylvania Senate primary<http=
s://domain.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/04/26/establishment-favor=
ite-mcginty-holds-big-lead-in-pennsylvania-senate-primary/>

Katie McGinty won the hotly contested Pennsylvania Democratic primary Tuesd=
ay, setting up a critical race against Republican Sen. Pat Toomey this fall=
 that will help determine the Senate majority next year. A relative newcome=
r to elective politics, McGinty used the endorsement of President Obama and=
 more than $4 million in spending on her behalf from outside liberal groups=
 to knock off former congressman Joe Sestak, whose solo style of campaignin=
g sparked a bitter feud with Democrats in Washington. After a truce effort =
failed last year, Senate Democrats worked to find someone other than the fo=
rmer Navy admiral to run against Toomey, believing Sestak's quirky personal=
ity would hurt them in such a key contest.

Wisconsin

Feingold says Johnson 'hasn't really tried' to reduce national debt<<<link>>

n-to-get-our-country-out-of-debt/>

As the spotlight shifts to Wisconsin's U.S. Senate race, candidate Russ Fei=
ngold says that incumbent Ron Johnson "hasn't really tried" to reduce the n=
ational debt. Johnson countered Feingold's charge by pointing to his rival'=

2016 - Governors

Indiana

Indiana polls show close races for president, governor<<<link>>
content/news/Indiana-polls-show-close-races-for-president-governor-37716574=
1.html>

The campaign trail is heating up, and with the Indiana presidential primary=
 just a week away, recent polls by WTHR and Howey Politics Indiana reveal w=
hich candidates are in the lead. In the GOP race, Donald Trump is polling a=
t 37 percent, but Ted Cruz isn't far behind with 31 percent. John Kasich co=
mes in third with 22 percent. It's important to point out that this poll wa=
s taken a day or two before the Cruz-Kasich alliance, so we'll see how that=
 affects future polls.

Utah

Rolly: Gov. Herbert got tag-teamed at Utah's GOP convention<<<link>>
domain.com/home/3818228-155/rolly-gov-herbert-got-tag-teamed-at>

Gov. Gary Herbert's failure to lock up the Republican nomination at the sta=
te convention without having a primary may have been the result of a tag-te=
am match in violation of GOP rules. Herbert had three Republican rivals goi=
ng into Saturday's showdown, with Jonathan Johnson seen as the only viable =
threat. During the convention speeches from the gubernatorial candidates, N=
ate Jensen took his six-minute allotment to rail against Herbert, scolding =
him on the Common Core, tax hikes and the Count My Vote compromise reviled =
by the party's hard core.

West Virginia

A look at W.Va. governor candidate Jim Justice<<<link>>
s/a-look-at-w-va-governor-candidate-jim-justice/article_8892aa86-0c15-11e6-=
a8b3-5b6cbdc48bff.html>

The only real political outsider in the governor's race this year, Jim Just=
ice might also have the most statewide name recognition. Outside the politi=
cal arena, Justice has built empires in coal, agriculture and tourism, and =
with that, a reputation for getting things done. Worth more than $1.5 billi=
on, Justice has become a household name in the region after his 2015 purcha=
se of The Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs. Justice's investment =
there, $20.1 million, seemed to be at once a bargain and an instantaneous b=
oondoggle when he began losing more than $1 million a week at the historic =
property.
