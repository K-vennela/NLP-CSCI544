Dear all,




Excellent opening shows for Cloudy in France. Opening day will be around 38 000 adms without previews and 50 000 adms with previews, so 80% more than Cloudy 1. In GBO, 220 000€ without previews and 290 000€ with previews, and 65%  more than Cloudy1 only, due to the new fixed 4€ price for audience under 14 years old.
Week-end estimate( to be adjusted tomorrow with the real opening day results): 1M/1.1M.

The animation movie opening today “Jack et la mecanique du Coeur” did much less than us.

School holidays haven’t started yet, so it is very promising numbers. And trackings of the upcoming animation movies, Peabody and Lego, are poor.



Best regards

Eric
