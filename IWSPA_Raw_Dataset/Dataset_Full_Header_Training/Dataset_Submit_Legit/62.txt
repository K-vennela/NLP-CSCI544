Hey guys - I think they'll probably take a spokesperson, doesn't need to be Debbie. But passing along for you to decide.

Hello T.J.

I am sorry I didn't get a chance to meet you when you were in Flint for the debate but maybe we will meet at the Democratic Convention.

I am contacting you because Bankole Thompson Editorial Columnist at The domain.com News and host on domain.com's newest radio station Superstation 910 am ( he is a former host on WDET public radio in domain.com where he interviewed the chair on what was then an overcrowded Republican field of candidates and the difference between that race and the Democratic race) would like to interview Rep. Schultz on his show Friday April 29, 2016. He would like to discuss the recent caucuses as well as Ted Cruz's decision to name Carly Fiorina as his running mate and their attraction to potential voters.

Redline airs every Friday from 12:00m-2:00pm. We would prefer to have her at 1:00pm as that is our most listened to hour but we will take her anytime she is available during the show. If she is not available this week, perhaps she could join us next week.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter,

Karen Morgan
Producer
Redline
