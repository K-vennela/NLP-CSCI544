OrganizationChair Statement on Republican Senator Admitting Senate Republicans Shou=
ld do Their Job on Supreme Court

WASHINGTON - OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following s=
tatement on Senator Jeff Flake's comments this weekend on Meet the Press th=
at if Republicans lose the presidential election they "ought to approve [Ch=
ief Judge Garland] quickly:"

"Senator Flake's comments are a reminder that Republicans are playing domain.com=
ical games with the Supreme Court. Chief Judge Garland is the most qualifie=
d nominee to immediately serve on the Supreme Court, with more federal judi=
cial experience than any other nominee in history, he should get a fair hea=
ring and a vote. That the GOP has nominated a reckless and dangerous candid=
ate in Donald Trump who lacks the temperament and judgment to serve -- much=
 less appoint a Supreme Court justice -- should be enough for Republicans i=
n the Senate to do their job now, not recklessly leave a Supreme Court seat=
 unfilled until November."
