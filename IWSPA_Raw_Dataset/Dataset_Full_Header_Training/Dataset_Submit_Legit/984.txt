Sanders accuses Organizationof tipping convention toward Clinton<<<link>>>
By DANIEL STRAUSS<<<link>>>

Bernie Sanders is accusing Organization chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of trying to tip the party convention in Hillary Clinton's favor, saying the chairwoman has packed the committees with Clinton supporters.
In a letter<<<link>>> to the chairwoman, the Sanders noted that of the 45 names he submitted Democratic National Convention committees, Wasserman Schultz appointed only three.
Story Continued Below
"I believe the composition of the standing committees must reflect the relative support that has been received by both campaigns," Sanders wrote in the letter dated May 6. "That was why I was so disappointed to learn that of the over forty people our campaign submitted at your request you chose to select only three of my recommendations for the three standing committees. Moreover, you did not assign even on of the people submitted by our campaign to the very important Rules Committee of the Democratic National Convention."
Sanders said that if the disagreement over convention committee appointments is not resolved, he would have his delegates move to change the platform on the floor of the convention.
"It is my hope we can quickly resolve this in a fair way," Sanders wrote. "If the process is set up to produce an unfair, one-sided result, we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules of the floor convention."
Sanders' chances of taking the Democratic nomination have grown, as he has a deep disadvantage in both pledged and superdelegates. But the insurgent candidate has vowed to continue on, and his deep run into the primary gives him additional leverage to pull the party to the left.
In his letter, Sanders also mentioned the Democratic Party platform drafting committee. In the letter he recounted Wasserman Schultz had discussed changing the process for selecting members of the committee.
"In our conversation, you told me with respect to the platform Drafting Committee that you would consider allowing each campaign to domain.com ten names from which you would choose four from each and then you would add an additional seven," Sanders continued. "While having four members on the Drafting Committee is an improvement, it does not address the fact that up to this point Bernie 2015 has secured 45% of the pledged delegates awarded. Frankly, we believe that percentage will go up in the coming weeks and, of course, we hope it will end up being a majority."
Sanders argued that each campaign should be able to pick seven members for the committee with the fifteenth member being one picked by both campaigns.
"This process will also ensure that the chairs of the standing committees conduct their proceedings with fairness and transparency," Sanders argued.
In its response to Sanders letter, the Organizationreleased a statement saying both campaigns would be represented at the convention.
"Because the Party's platform is a statement of our values, the Organizationis committed to an open, inclusive and representative process," the Organizationsaid in a statement. "Both of our campaigns will be represented on the Drafting Committee, and just as we did in 2015 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate"

Sanders wants supporters represented at party convention<<<link>>>
AP // KEN THOMAS

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders threatened a floor fight over rules and platform planks at the party's summer convention on Friday, warning the Organization not to stack the convention's standing committees with supporters of Hillary Clinton.

Sanders wrote in a letter to Organization Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz that the makeup of the standing committees that consider the party's platform and rules should reflect the level of support that he and Clinton have received during the 2015 primaries and caucuses.

"If the process is set up to produce an unfair, one-sided result, we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules on the floor of the convention," Sanders wrote. The letter came after Sanders spoke with the chairwoman by phone earlier this week.

Sanders said if the party is going to be unified in the fall, it can't have a convention in which the views of millions of people are "unrepresented" in the committee membership.

Pointing to the 9 million voters who have supported him, Sanders wrote, "I will not allow them be silenced at the Democratic National Convention."

User, a spokesman for the Organization, said "because the party's platform is a statement of our values, the Organizationis committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both of our campaigns will be represented on the drafting committee, and just as we did in 2015 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate."

Clinton holds a sizable lead of more than 300 pledged delegates and has received about 3 million more votes than Sanders during the primaries. Including superdelegates - the elected party leaders and officials who can choose the candidate of their choice - Clinton is more than 90 percent of the way to clinching the nomination.

In the letter, Sanders notes that Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy will be in charge of the convention's platform committee and former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank will run the rules committee. He calls both "aggressive attack surrogates on the campaign trail" for Clinton.

Sanders said he submitted the names of more than 40 people to serve on three standing committees and only three of his recommendations were selected by Wasserman Schultz. He said none of his supporters were assigned to the rules committee.

The Vermont senator has vowed to campaign through the end of the primary season in mid-June and advocate at the convention for his policy goals, which include fighting wealth inequality and overhauling the campaign finance system. He has also criticized states that do not allow independents to participate in Democratic contests or states that do not allow same-day registration.

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is threatening a floor fight over rules and platform planks at the party's summer convention if the Organization stacks the committees with supporters of Hillary Clinton.
Sanders writes in a letter to Organization chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz that the makeup of the standing committees should reflect the level of support that he and Clinton received in the primaries and caucuses.
He says many of his supporters have not been included and notes Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy will be in charge of the convention's platform committee and former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank will run the rules committee. He calls both "aggressive attack surrogates" for Clinton.
Sanders says if the process is unfair, he'll challenge platform planks, electoral reform planks and rules changes.
