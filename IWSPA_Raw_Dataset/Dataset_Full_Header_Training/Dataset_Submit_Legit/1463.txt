User,

You mentioned to me earlier this week you guys were still looking to fill the Mid-Atlantic RCD position. Since it has been months since we discussed this and the position hasn't been filled it fell out of the budget. We are working to put it back in, so please keep me in the loop as you work through this process so we get the timing right.

Thanks,

Lindsey
