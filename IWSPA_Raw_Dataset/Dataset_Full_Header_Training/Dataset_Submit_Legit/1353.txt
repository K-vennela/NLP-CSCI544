Raul:

It was great seeing you again over the weekend. I'm gone tomorrow through Monday in Guatemala, but we should meet up at some point after that to catch up and hear what y'all are planning and hearing, etc. as the convention and general election near. I'm especially eager to keep close tabs on Latino voter outreach, mobilization, registration, candidate recruitment, etc.

Let me know, keep in touch,
