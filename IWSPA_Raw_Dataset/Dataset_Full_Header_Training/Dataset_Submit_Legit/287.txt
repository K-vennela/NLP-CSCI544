From Florida section:

"Republicans' weakness among minority voters is well known. But the reason this race is so close overall is Clinton's historic weakness among white men. In Florida, she is getting just 25 percent from white men," Brown said.

*         PENNSYLVANIA: Clinton 43 - Trump 42; Sanders 47 - Trump 41
