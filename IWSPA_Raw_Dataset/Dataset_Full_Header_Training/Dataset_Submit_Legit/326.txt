Oggetto: Re: EA - HT Milano Training Dear Emad, I know this is not included in the contract, but we need to do our best to recover the satisfaction of this customer. You may know that the customer was completely unhappy with HT company services during last year and also with the breaches happened from HT.  I think last meeting between Mostafa and the customer included all the customer worries and I think Daniele is updated and is working on these worries with Hazem. I advise you and HT to make more efforts to recover the satisfaction this customer. Thank you, moniem. On Jul 1, 2014, at 11:38 AM, Emad Shehata wrote: Dear MoniemThanks for your e-mail. Based on the contract that we signed ( here in attached) the course/training had expected to be done in 10 days.HT gave a discount of a total amount of € 12.000,00 ( from € 307.000,00 to € 295.000,00) to allow you to take in charge of Transportation and Accomodation. This is a condition that has not been modified by the parties until now.For meet your request, we domain.com the training in 2 session, it means, 20 days instead of 10. And we agreed to fractionize it in 2 session of working 5 days each.By phone I was agree to spent my free time with them, meaning on Saturday and Sunday and bring them maybe in Rome or Venice, but no confirmation of taking in care of the expensive.Currently there are no agreements between the parties on the customers' expense, apart from existing contract signed. If you have other agreement on this, please inform me; otherwise we will follow as per our agreement in the contract. I remain at your completely disposal for any requirement you may need. Best regards Emad Shehata
