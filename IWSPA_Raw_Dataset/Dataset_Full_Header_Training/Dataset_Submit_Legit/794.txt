Pete Wilson says Ted Cruz is =91not anti-immigrant=92<<<link>>
/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article74906362.html>
BY DAVID SIDERS

Former Gov. Pete Wilson, endorsing Ted Cruz for president on Saturday, did =
not mention Proposition 187, the 1994 initiative Wilson championed to restr=
ict state services to undocumented immigrants.
The measure =96 while overturned by the courts =96 did lasting damage to th=
e Republican Party=92s effort to domain.com Latino voters in California.
But Wilson volunteered this about the Texas senator, whose position on ille=
gal immigration, like Donald Trump=92s, includes building a wall along the =
U.S.-Mexico border: =93He is not anti-immigrant. He, as am I, is for legal =
immigration of the kind that has made this country great.=94
Wilson endured a strained relationship with party activists for years after=
 he left office 1999, with many conservatives unwilling to forgive him for =
raising taxes and supporting abortion rights. But his relationship appeared=
 to improve when, during the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis =
in 2008, he called President Barack Obama a socialist.

In 2012, Wilson was in Tampa to announce California Republicans=92 support =
for Mitt Romney on the convention floor.

He received a standing ovation on Saturday.
Wilson, a former U.S. senator, assemblyman and San Diego mayor, cast Donald=
 Trump, the Republican frontrunner, as an unpredictable executive who canno=
t be trusted to nominate conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices.

=93Heaven knows what justices Donald Trump would pick,=94 he said. =93We ca=
n=92t afford a wild-card when it comes to a president who will be making cr=
itically important Supreme Court appointments.=94
Wilson likened Cruz=92s candidacy to that of former President Ronald Reagan=
.
=93America today is in desperate need of a strong, winning Republican leade=
r,=94 Wilson said. =93And my friends, thankfully, that strong Republican le=
ader has stepped forward in our moment of extreme need.=94
John Burton, chairman of the state Democratic Party, was happy to weigh in =
with a mention of Proposition 187.

=93Former California Governor Pete Wilson, who was the champion of the mean=
-spirited and unconstitutional Proposition 187, has endorsed Ted Cruz for p=
resident,=94 Burton said in a statement. =93Gov. Wilson can explain to Sen.=
 Cruz the benefits of having strong anti-immigration policies in California=
 =96 they have worked so well for the Republican Party here.=94
