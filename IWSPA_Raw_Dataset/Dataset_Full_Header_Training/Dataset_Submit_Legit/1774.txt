Trump, Reagan, and the Downsizing of History<<<link>>

ocial_twitter>

In the search for figures bearing comparisons to Donald Trump, one's mind i=
nevitably wanders back in time. After a brief pause to muse over Sarah Pali=
n, one soon moves to the late Ronald Reagan, the last entertainer who ran f=
or the Presidency of the United States, which he won. For all the posthumou=
s veneration that Reagan now receives, there are Americans who point to his=
 candidacy as having fatally lowered the bar for qualifications for entry t=
o the White House. It is hard to recall a moment when anyone accused Reagan=
 of lording a superior knowledge over others. This seems unlikely to happen=
 anytime soon with Trump, too.

Unlike Trump, though, Reagan had a pleasingly mellifluous voice and a studi=
ed actor's ease at the podium, and he appeared to actually believe in the i=
deas he expressed. He might not have command of the briefing books, but the=
re was a philosophy there. There was also a convincing sense that Reagan, w=
hatever his political views, was a nice guy. However he may behave in his p=
ersonal life, Trump's public persona is a mash-up of the prurient cruelties=
 of Jerry Springer with the selfie-stick vanity of the Kardashians. He has =
repeatedly shown his bullying nature and variously ridiculed his fellow can=
didates for their physical size ("Little Marco" Rubio), purported dishonest=
y ("Crooked Hillary" Clinton), and reputed ugliness (Carly Fiorina). When s=
omeone at one of his rallies called Ted Cruz a "pussy," Trump immediately r=
epeated the word.

But a more telling contrast between the two men comes in the area of foreig=
n policy. Coming into the Oval Office, thirty-five years ago, Reagan was th=
e embodiment of a galaxy of homespun simplicities that he had helped nurtur=
e as an actor on behalf of his own Great Generation; as President during th=
e last decade of the Cold War, his good-versus-evil rhetoric was often cart=
oonish. Nonetheless, it spoke to certain truths. "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down =
this wall" was a line straight out of Twentieth Century Fox, and may have e=
nded up as little more than a hollow flourish had it not been for the colla=
pse of the Soviet Union, a few years later. That event, though, gave Reagan=
 the good fortune of appearing to have been morally righteous, historically=
 clairvoyant, and strong, without ever actually going to war.

Since those days, of course, the world has shown itself to be a much more c=
omplex place, as subsequent Presidents have learned, usually to their chagr=
in, with some faring better than others. George W. Bush did a particularly =
poor job at matching his own efforts at a Reaganesque rhetoric to the momen=
t: "Mission Accomplished" comes to mind. And now we have Donald Trump.

Trump's "America First"-themed foreign-policy address last week, in Washing=
ton, D.C., was billed as his first attempt at delivering a grown-up speech.=
 It would, it was said, be something other than the usual ad-lib assemblage=
 of stream-of-consciousness riffs, drive-by insults, know-nothing japing, a=
nd self-referential preening that some Americans find so fetching (to judge=
 from primary-vote totals) and ratings-worthy (to judge from the airtime th=
e networks give him). And so, on Wednesday, Trump stood in front of a telep=
rompter, in all his orangeness, and tried his best, with a speech that some=
one had evidently helped him write, to sound serious.

Trump quickly hit all the high-concept trouble spots-Israel, Iraq, Iran, Sy=
ria, Egypt, Libya, Russia, China-anywhere he could take a passing swipe at =
Barack Obama or his current main rival, Hillary Clinton. He invoked them to=
 declare, once and again, as he has many times on the stump, that he would =
make America great again by being firmer than Obama, and would put America =
first. There was little that was dramatic or memorable, perhaps by design; =
it seemed that the speech was more of an exercise in proving that he could =
get through an appearance without saying something unhinged. In that sense,=
 he was more or less successful, although observers were quick to point out=
 his general superficiality. And the irrepressible man from Mar-a-Lago mana=
ged to utter a few off-script Trumpisms-"very bad," "believe me," a "disast=
er"-the now-familiar verbal crutches of a man who is singularly driven to c=
onstantly speak his mind while not really possessing the means to do so. He=
 looked less like Reagan at the Wall than like Dean Martin during his stand=
up routines.

Although he didn't repeat it for his "America First" speech, Trump's ultima=
te foreign-policy statement remains that he will build a wall, a beautiful =
wall, and make Mexico pay for it. Perhaps he believes that, with such comme=
nts, he will gain honor abroad for a disrespected and abused United States-=
a theme he revisited frequently in his speech. If so, he is far from achiev=
ing that goal. Instead, Trump has gained popularity in Mexico as a best-sel=
ling papier-m=E2ch=E9 pi=F1ata, with his mouth obscenely open, the better f=
or people to bash it with sticks at birthday parties, and at any other oppo=
rtunity.

As with his threats about the wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, Trump's main=
 foreign-policy position seems to be about making other countries pay for t=
hings. Much as real-estate developers who wish to use his name on their bui=
ldings must pay Trump a handsome fee, it seems he wants America's deadbeat =
allies to pony up a fairer share of the bills. In his speech on Wednesday, =
for example, Trump promised to make Washington's European NATO allies pay t=
heir fair share of their membership dues, or else, he hinted, they'd be cut=
 loose from the U.S. defense umbrella.

As for Russia, Trump said, "I believe an easing of tensions, and improved r=
elations with Russia from a position of strength only, is possible, absolut=
ely possible. Common sense says this cycle . . . of hostility must end and =
ideally will end soon. Good for both countries." Trump went on to say that =
as President he would engage with Russia and "try and get a deal that's gre=
at-not good-great for America" and that if he couldn't get one, he would "q=
uickly walk from the table. It's that simple." In the front row of the audi=
ence for Trump's speech at the Mayflower was none other than Sergey Kislyak=
, Vladimir Putin's ambassador to the United States. He diplomatically refra=
ined from offering his opinion on the speech.

Thirty years after Reagan dared his greatest adversary to tear down the Ber=
lin Wall, we have Trump boisterously claiming he wants to build a new one, =
not to keep out Communists, or even the ISIS terrorists he mysteriously cla=
ims to know how to eliminate, but people from Mexico, our closest neighbor =
to the south, a friendly nation, and one on which we rely for a significant=
 percentage of our labor market, as well as our imported oil. If this is no=
t a downsizing of history, then what is?
