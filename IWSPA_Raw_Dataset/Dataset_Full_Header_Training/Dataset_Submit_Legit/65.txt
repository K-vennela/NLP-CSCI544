*A Look at Trump's Real Foreign Policy Agenda: Unpredictable and Dangerous*

Donald Trump is ramping up his efforts to appear serious about foreign
policy and convince a very resistant Republican Party that he's a plausible
commander-in-chief. Just last night, CNN reported that
<<<link>>> he =E2=
=80=9Cwants to
come across as a man of substance.=E2=80=9D But every time he opens his mou=
th, he
seems to undermine that goal.

On Monday, Donald Trump sent shockwaves through the UK
<<<link>>
op-ally-amid-ongoing-push-for-warmer-relations-with-putin-russia/>,
one of our oldest and closest allies, as he insulted David Cameron and
casually predicted our special relationship might turn sour under a Trump
presidency. Apparently he doesn't have the same contempt for Kim Jong Un as
he does for Cameron -- Tuesday he turned around and said he would have =E2=
=80=9Cno
problem=E2=80=9D
<<<link>>
l>
speaking with the North Korean dictator, whom he previously praised
<<<link>>

for executing his uncle.

He has drawn heavy criticism from leaders in the England
<<<link>>
hdraw-remarks-branding-donald-trump-divisive-and-stupid-a7013846.html>,
Germany
<<<link>>

and France
<<<link>>
-trump-is-so-stupid>,
while earning praise from the Russians
<<<link>>
day-rt-kremlin-media-vladimir-putin-213833>
(Trump is, of course, a Russia expert -- he hosted Miss Universe contest
there
<<<link>>
rump-russia-miss-universe/84024666/>)
and generating excitement in Iran
<<<link>>>. He seems
dead-set on weakening our allies and emboldening our adversaries.

With each new day seems to come new comments from Trump that underscore
just how ill-prepared he is to be commander-in-chief. But let's not forget
about the dangerous set of proposals he's already put forward on this
campaign -- here are just a few of his many bad ideas:

   -

   Banning all Muslims
   <<<link>>
n-preventing-muslim-immigration>
   from entering America.

   -

   Allowing more countries
   <<<link>>
n-south-korea-saudi-arabia>
   to get nuclear weapons, including
   <<<link>>
d-trump-cnn-milwaukee-republican-presidential-town-hall/>
   Japan, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia.

   -

   Intentionally killing
   <<<link>>
/index.html?sr=3DtwCNN120215donald-trump-terrorists-families/0141PMVODtopLi=
nk&linkId=3D19235497>
   innocent family members of terrorist fighters.

   -

   Bringing back torture
   <<<link>>
cruz_advocate_bringing_back_waterboarding.html>,
   which doesn=E2=80=99t work
   <<<link>>
clinton/evidence-backs-hillary-clinton-claim-torture-count/>
   and makes our troops less safe.

   -

   Walking away
   <<<link>>
own-hall-with-donald-trump-moderated-by-chris-matthews?lite>
   from NATO unless we can extract more money from our allies.

   -

   Sending tens of thousands
   <<<link>>
ht-isis/article/2001505>
   of troops back to the Middle East.

   -

   Demanding that <<<link>>> Israel pay
   us back for our defense aid.
