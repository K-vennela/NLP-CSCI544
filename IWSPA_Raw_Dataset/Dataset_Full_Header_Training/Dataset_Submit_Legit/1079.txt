RBC Members,

I hope that you had a great weekend!  Below, please find a message from Co-Chairs Jim Roosevelt and Lorraine Miller:

Dear RBC Members,

As you all know, there has been a great deal of attention placed on the Democratic delegate selection process by the press and public in recent weeks.  Some of the information is accurate, and some of it is not; therefore we have compiled the attached memo to circulate to press and our networks in order to set the record straight about our process.  Donna Brazile approached us with the idea and played an instrumental role in the memo's creation.

We wanted to make sure that each of you had a copy of the memo to use as a resource and to circulate to your networks.  We thank each of you for all of the work you have done to maintain the integrity and transparency of the Democratic delegate selection process.

Best,

Jim Roosevelt and Lorraine Miller

RBC Co-Chairs
