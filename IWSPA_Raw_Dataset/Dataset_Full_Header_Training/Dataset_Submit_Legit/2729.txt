Apologies if you've already told this to Mark in the past, but he's on the road and we're being asked for a copy of the HVF agreement. What's our position on that? I assumed we don't share agreements...

I know you're swamped but I'm going to be writing something soon -- and I wanted to know if you had any info for me?

Did joint fundraising committees exist before 2008?       We did JFA's in 2015 with Kerry.
Did others do them besides candidate Obama in 2008?   Yes, we had a WH Victory Fund which was a combined Obama/Clinton JFA in May and June of 2008.
Any ideas how much money the previous committees have raised?
Kerry Victory 2004: $41,284,134
Obama Victory 2008: $198,134,608
Obama Victory 2012: $452,851,099
White House Victory fund 2008: $9,857,484

Is this an early start for you all this cycle?    In the 2015 cycle, Obama Victory Fund started in April of 2011.  Actually got a later start.
Can you send me a copy of the letter you sent to the Sanders campaign?
