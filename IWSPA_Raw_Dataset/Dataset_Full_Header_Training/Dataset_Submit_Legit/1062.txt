Subject: For Review: NBC News: Former Speaker Boehner Calls Cruz 'Lucifer in the Flesh'

Looks like another Washington establishment figure is ready to rally around Trump! It makes perfect sense - Boehner's obstruction of progress and inability to rein in the most extreme voices in his party laid the groundwork for the GOP's natural frontrunner and his "texting buddy," Donald Trump.

NBC News: Former Speaker Boehner Calls Cruz 'Lucifer in the Flesh'<<<link>>>

by CARRIE DANN

John Boehner is not a big fan of Ted Cruz.

So much so, in fact, that the former Republican House Speaker told an audience at Stanford University Wednesday that the Texas senator is "Lucifer in the flesh" and a "miserable son of a bitch."

Asked about the 2015 presidential candidate at a forum hosted by Stanford in Government (SIG) and the Stanford Speakers Bureau, Boehner drew laughter for making a face of disgust, according to the Stanford Daily.<<<link>>>

"Lucifer in the flesh," Boehner said, according to the paper. "I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life."

He added that he would vote for Donald Trump in a general election if he becomes the Republican nominee but that he would not vote for Cruz.

Boehner was reportedly urged by the event's moderator, Professor David M. Kennedy, to be frank because the event was not being broadcast.

The former Ohio lawmaker had kinder words for his "texting buddy" Donald Trump, with whom Boehner has played golf with for "years."

And he described another 2015 candidate, John Kasich, as a "friend" too, although he suggested that the relationship takes "more effort" than others.

"[Kasich] requires more effort on my behalf than all my other friends ... but he's still my friend, and I love him," Boehner said.

Cruz famously led a group of hard-line conservatives who derailed House leaders' attempts to avoid a government shutdown in 2013. Cruz's failed attempt to force the defunding of President Barack Obama's signature health care law resulted in a 16-day shutdown that was widely seen as politically damaging for the Republican Party.

Boehner stepped down from his role as House Speaker last September under political pressure from conservatives on Capitol Hill.

NBC News has reached out to Cruz's team for comment.
