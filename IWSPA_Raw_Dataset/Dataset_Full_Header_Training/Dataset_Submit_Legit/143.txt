Dear Esmee,

I'll send you a formal request in a while. Is there a template to fulfill or is it sufficient a letter signed by Mr. Vincenzetti?

Thanks again for your support.

Dear Simonetta,



Sorry for the confusion, I meant Mr. Bedeschi instead.




We will not be able to remove him via your email instructions, an approved signatory form has to be filled up and sent to the bank for further action.



Hope this clarifies, once I receive the domain.com confirmation, I will fax to your auditors.




Thank you.

Dear Esmee,

Maybe there is a misunderstanding.

Mr. Vincenzetti is and remains the only signatory for our account.

About the formal letter, it's is clearly a mistake and the request is valid until 31st March 2015; is it sufficient my e-mail or you need another formal letter?

Please let me know.

Thanks,

Dear Simonetta,



Noted on your information however, we will still require your end to remove Mr. Vincenzetti as currently our system still reflects him as a signatory. You
 can do so by completing the forms that was sent via the previous email.



Also, my domain.com confirmation team wants to clarify, your letter of authorization is valid till 31st Mar 2015 or 2014? It is written as 2015 in the
 letter. The domain.com confirmation can only confirm the signatories as at the date of issuance of request letter.



Please let me know if this is fine.




Thank you.

It's correct: the only authorized signatory for current account is Mr. Vincenzetti; no modify is required.

Dear Simonetta,



Yes, Mr Vincenzetti is a signatory for current account.




He is currently a signatory and an approved person (able to remove and appoint signatories), if you wish to remove him as a signatory and an approved person,
 please use both :



1.    
Approved signatory form – removal of signatory.
2.    
Change in approved person




Kindly send me us the original for our action.




Thank you.

Dear Esmee, 




I need an additional information. 




Before replying to our auditors, can you please tell me if only Mr. Vincenzetti has signatory power or also Mr. Bedeschi? 




If Mr. Bedeschi is included, I kindly request you to delete his name, since he isn't legal ripresentative, starting from Jan. 31st 2014.




Looking forward to your answer.

Best regards, 




Simonetta
