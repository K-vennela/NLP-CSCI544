Panel: Matt Dowd, Donna Brazile, Cokie Roberts, Bill Kristol

Dowd: unpopularity contest
Donna: Trump has consolidated the GOP. Dems still in contentious primary.
Cokie: Young people off of Hillary completely.
Kristol: =BC for trump, =BC for Clinton, =BD wants an alternative
Cokie: Republican registration is up - should tell you something
Cokie: Bernie saying he can win is ridiculous - hasn't been challenged / no=
 negative ads against him
Donna: has to focus on millennials. At the end of the day: white women will=
 determine this election

Donna: Problem with Trump is that he'll flexible, he'll continue to change.=
 Hillary won't change on this issue -
Cokie: people who are pro-gun wont vote for HRC. White women on the fence c=
ould look at her and be right about this.
Dowd: focus on guns shows huge culture war will be litigated in 2015 electi=
on
Donna: HFA has to run a campaign for the presidency - talk about big issues=
. Playing down to Trump's level is not going to work for her
Dowd: people don't vote on issues - they vote on values
Cokie: correct, which is why it's so troubling that Trump says tax returns =
are nobody's business.

GOP operatives Bill Kristol & Matthew Dowd both trying to give HFA advice o=
n what to do.

Kristol: 15 percent threshold for debate. If you get a three way between Hi=
llary, Trump and someone like Ben Sasse, all bets are off.

Bernie Sanders:

Can you lay out a credible path to stop HRC?
- Cites wins in Indiana, West Virginia, and Oregon
- Have to do very well to get to 50% of pledged delegates
- Super delegates should take a look at which candidate is better equipped =
for general

HRC has 3 million more votes and only needs 90 more pledged?
- Steep uphill climb
- "I don't want the American people voting for the lesser of two evils"

HRC the lesser of two evils?
- Well, I wouldn't describe it as that
- But both have high unfavorables

Will you be able to convince your supporters to back HRC over Trump?
- I have confidence that if HRC is prepared to stand up to corporate greed,=
 be strong on climate change, and address income inqueality, I think she wi=
ll win by a large number of votes

Will you push for those issues on the party platform?
- We will push for the most progressive agenda we can

Supporters planning protests in Philadephia?
- Rejects media coverage of Nevada
- No chairs being thrown, no violence, no one being rude
- People going to Philadeplphia have first amendment right to demonstrate

Open to being Hillary Clinton's VP?
- Too early to talk about that
- Currently running all over CA and NM to get every last vote
