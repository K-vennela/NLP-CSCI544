Zika

*         Today, the President and Vice President received a briefing on th=
e ongoing response to the Zika virus from members of his public health team=
 including Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell, D=
irector of NIH/NIAID Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Director of the Centers for Dis=
ease Control and Prevention Dr. Tom Frieden.

*         Following the meeting, the President highlighted the facts about =
this disease and the ways it spreads and underscored that as summer approac=
hes we need to step up our efforts to protect Americans, something the Pres=
ident has long called for.

*         Three months ago, he asked Congress to approve $1.9 billion in em=
ergency funding to combat Zika.  $1.9 billion isn't an arbitrary number.  I=
t's what public health experts consider necessary to fund things like mosqu=
ito control, tracking the spread of the virus, accelerating new vaccines to=
 market, and monitoring women and babies with the virus.

*         The Republican Senate has only approved about half of that money.=
  The Republican House has approved no new money, instead taking money from=
 the funding we need to keep fighting Ebola - and that money will run out i=
n September.

*         As the President made clear, we cannot partially fight this disea=
se - and Republicans in the House and Senate need to do their jobs. They ne=
ed to get a bill to the President's desk.

*         Every day Congress waits will have consequences.  Slower, less ac=
curate diagnostic tests.  Delayed vaccines.  Weaker mosquito control effort=
s.  It puts the American people at risk.

*         The American people should expect their representatives to do the=
ir jobs, and give our experts the resources they need to fight this disease=
 and keep us safe.

The President's Foreign Travel

*         The President's trip to Vietnam and Japan - his 10th trip to Asia=
 as President - provides a historic opportunity to further the progress in =
U.S.-Vietnam relations and is another step forward in the President's Rebal=
ance to the Asia-Pacific.

*         In Vietnam, the President will focus on advancing our economic co=
operation and trade. We anticipate the President will deliver a speech on U=
.S.-Vietnam relations and the TPP and announce major commercial deals that =
will help U.S. businesses.

*         Maritime security, human rights, and people-to-people ties are al=
so key components of the Vietnam trip.

*         The President will domain.com Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. In Hanoi he =
will have bilateral meetings with Vietnamese leaders and meet with Civil So=
ciety representatives. He will also deliver remarks on U.S.-Vietnam relatio=
ns at the National Convention Center. And in Ho Chi Minh City he will domain.com=
 the Jade Pagoda and host a town hall with Young Southeast Asian Leaders (Y=
SEALI) and meet with entrepreneurs.

*         In Japan, the President will participate in his final G-7 domain.com =
in Ise-Shima. This gathering of world leaders enables them to address a ran=
ge of topics of mutual interest including the global economy, climate, fore=
ign policy issues, trade, terrorism, migration flows, and the situation in =
Ukraine.

*         In addition to G-7 member nations, leaders from at least six addi=
tional Asian nations will attend on the margins of the domain.com.

*         The Administration is working to leverage the domain.com as a venue t=
o advance our agenda on exchange rate commitments; economic support for Ira=
q; implementation of the Paris climate agreements; and the Global Health Se=
curity Agenda.

*         The President will also domain.com Hiroshima and give brief remarks.
