OrganizationChair Statement on  Cruz Suspending Campaign and Trump Becoming Republi=
can Presumptive Nominee

WASHINGTON =96 OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following=
 statement on Ted Cruz dropping out of the Republican primary and Donald Tr=
ump becoming the GOP=92s presumptive nominee:

=93Tonight, Donald Trump is the Republican Party. Ted Cruz may have been th=
e least-liked politician in Washington, but Trump is one of the least liked=
 men in America, and Democrats will hold him accountable for his offensive =
rhetoric, dangerous ideas, and lack of judgment every single day between to=
day and November 8th.<x-apple-data-detectors://3>

=93While Ted Cruz was known for obstruction, having forced a government shu=
tdown that cost the U.S. economy $24 billion and even opposing emergency ai=
d for a region hit by a devastating hurricane, he didn=92t stand up to Dona=
ld Trump until it was too late. None of the Republicans running for preside=
nt did, because after years of elevating extreme voices in their party, the=
y didn=92t want to alienate them.

=93The decades-old Republican strategy of exploiting unfounded fear of immi=
grants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all for politica=
l gain, have laid the groundwork for Donald Trump. The Republican Party sol=
d hardworking Americans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while=
 strangling America=92s middle class with backwards economic policies that =
only enrich those already at the top. Donald Trump=92s looming nomination w=
ill be the ultimate, destructive culmination of the results of that strateg=
y.

=93Democrats won=92t hesitate to fight for the vast majority of the America=
n people, who share our values of inclusion, hard work, dignity and opportu=
nity for all, and we=92ll hold Republicans on the ballot at every level acc=
ountable for their standard bearer. Voters will have a clear choice come No=
vember, and Americans of every stripe, including those disillusioned and di=
saffected by this year=92s unprecedentedly nasty Republican primary have a =
home in the Democratic Party. Our voters are energized, enthusiastic, and o=
ptimistic because our candidates are committed to moving America forward. A=
nd that=92s why we=92re going to win on Election Day in November.=94
