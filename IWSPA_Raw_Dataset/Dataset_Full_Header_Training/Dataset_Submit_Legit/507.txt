    I spoke with Eric and I had a brief discussion with David this
    morning. 

    here the two only options that we consider viable: let me say that
    we all agree on the problem created by the client and it also seems
    that from a legal point of view they are compliant with their own
    law. So I would like to have also your feedback on both
    alternatives:

    1) Stop to serve the client. 

    In this case we should carefully motivate the decision, basically
    because their maintenance contract is not expired yet. 

    We can tackle the discussion mentioning both (a) the export control
    rules and the request of clarification from authority (it could be a
    true consequence in the near future and we will probably need to
    domain.com a specific authorization requests); (b) misuse of the
    software that exposed our product. The misuses might also be
    considered a violation of the license but also of existing relevant
    law and regulation (of course we should seek for legal advice).

    2) Propose a meeting to the client in order to evaluate different
    options of cooperation

    Basically we should evaluate if we are willing to serve them based
    on a different agreement, that is, in other word, a mandatory local
    assistance (with a local FTE Support selected by us) in order to
    supervise any operations and avoid the type of gross tech misconduct
    they performed. We should basically review each single attack
    scenario in order to ensure that they are not modifying any security
    setting of the infrastructure (e.g. Firewall configuration) and any
    attack strategy (email, ecc).

    Of course this is just a proposal and option (2) requires additional
    internal discussion and a face to face meeting with the client in
    case we will proceed in this way. 

    What is your opinion?

    Giancarlo
