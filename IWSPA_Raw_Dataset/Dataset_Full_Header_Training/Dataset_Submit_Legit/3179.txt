Cruz interview with Tapper

Says it's been a very good week for his campaign; talks about endorsements from Pence and Pete Wilson - "California is likely to decide" this battle. Says he is working to bring the party together because if they're divided, they lose.

Calling picking Carly as VP is just what DJT is doing, not the reality. The reality is that it is laying out a clear contrast for the voters between him and Carly and DJT. Calls DJT and HRC two sides of the same coin - both New York liberals.

Tapper plans clip of Carly saying that Cruz is just like any politician and is part of the "cartel" Cruz attacks from January. Cruz says it's just like when Reagan chose HW as his VP and had to explain the things they said about each other during primary. Says Carly's secretary to CEO line.

On Boehner's comments: "I think Boehner kind of let out his inner Trump and had some colorful imagery there." Says DJT, HRC, Boehner are all part of the same corrupt Washington system that will make the rich get richer, while he and Carly are about bring up working class people.

Tapper plays Caitlyn Jenner video of using the women's restroom in Trump Tower and asks about Cruz's comments about child molestation. Cruz says it is common sense to make sure that adult men that are strangers shouldn't be in bathroom with little girls, and he isn't saying transgender people are predators, but it would open the door for predators to use women's restrooms.

*         It is the height of political correctness for DJT to say people can use whichever bathroom they please.

*         Behind the DJT mask is HRC - he gave seven contributions to her and supported Planned Parenthood, banning guns nationwide, being neutral on Israel/Palestine, and raising taxes.

HRC interview with Tapper

Said she doesn't consider herself the presumptive nominee and is going to keep competing in upcoming states

Asked about making a deal on issues with Sanders, says she looks forward to talking to Sanders in the lead up to the convention. Happy to hear that Sanders plans to work tirelessly 7 days a week to ensure DJT is not president.

Was hard to give up in the 2015 primary fight and understands what Sanders is going through. He's been a passionate advocate for democratic issues and has brought millions into the process.

On DJT FP: calls it "quite concerning," specifically his secret plan, pulling out of NATO, and nukes for more countries comments. Doesn't think any of it is a very smart way to move forward.

*         Says she has always used military force has a last resort, not a first choice, and that there'll be a lot to contrast with between her and DJT

Thinks DJT's comment that she'd be polling below 5% if she was a man is silly and doesn't square with reality.

Says she has a lot of experience with men that sometimes "get off the reservation" in their actions or the way they speak. Nothing secret about what she wants to do on the issues, but DJT hasn't laid it all out there - can't tell if it's because he won't or if it's because he can't.

In question about getting white working class votes, HRC pushed back by saying she won OH and PA, getting more votes than DJT in each.

*         Understands that some were helped and some were hurt by decisions in 1990s, talks about an old vehicle plant in OH that is part of the global market that she visited.

Tapper asked about HRC being at Trump's wedding to Melania, HRC says at that time it never crossed her mind that they would later be running against each other for President
