Groundbreaking for the new eight-story building on the studio lot that will allow us to transition out of the space we currently lease at Sony Pictures Plaza will begin in October. In preparation, an expansion of the Culver Motor Parking structure will begin next week. The site will be enclosed with fencing around the east side of the structure and a new pedestrian pathway will open on Wednesday, August 13. On Monday, August 18, vehicle traffic entering the structure through the Motor Gate will be rerouted once inside the gate to a temporary entrance on the north side of the structure (see map above). Access to the structure via the Mentone gate will not change. We anticipate construction of the east garage expansion and new basketball court on the roof of the structure to be completed in June 2015. When construction of the east expansion is completed, an expansion on the west side of the structure will begin. Save the domain.com's the only domain.com with chocolate!____________________________________________________________________FAYANNE KANNER   |   Executive Assistant to Steve Mosko, President |   Sony Pictures Television
