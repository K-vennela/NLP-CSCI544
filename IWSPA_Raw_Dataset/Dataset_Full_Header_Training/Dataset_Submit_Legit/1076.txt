Here, with edits from the chair

"Mike Pence's endorsement of Ted Cruz is no surprise for those of us familiar with Pence's extreme record. They have a lot in common. After Mike Pence signed the embarrassing and unnecessary RFRA law that could cost our state upwards of $250 million and drove jobs away from Indiana, Ted Cruz supported the governor and advocated the federal government adopt a similar law. Mike Pence signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation; Ted Cruz has said rape victims should be forced to carry pregnancies to term. Ted Cruz has campaigned for president on an extremist, divisive ideology, and Mike Pence has put that same extreme ideology into practice, causing Indiana to fall behind the rest of the nation." - Indiana Chairman John Zody
