Restoring Bathroom Sanity in North Carolina<<<link>>

NEW YORK TIMES // EDITORIAL BOARD
The Department of Justice has given Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina unti=
l Monday to abandon the state's discriminatory law barring transgender peop=
le from using public restrooms based on their gender identity. The law also=
 blocked Charlotte's antidiscrimination ordinance, and prohibited cities an=
d counties from enacting similar laws. In a letter issued Thursday, the Jus=
tice Department's top civil rights prosecutor, Vanita Gupta, warned the gov=
ernor that the statute, which was passed in March, violates federal civil r=
ights law. She said that the Department of Justice may sue North Carolina a=
nd that the Department of Education may withhold federal funding for its sc=
hools. The state law peddles the malicious idea that transgender people are=
 sexual predators and that allowing people to use a bathroom that reflects =
their gender identity violates the rights of others. It immediately drew a =
strong backlash from civil rights groups, religious leaders and businesses.=
 Major corporations have decried the law, calling it an impediment to recru=
iting and retaining top talent. Employers have already suspended plans to e=
xpand operations in North Carolina, costing the state hundreds of jobs.
