Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private

Donald J. Trump had barely met Rowanne Brewer Lane when he asked her to cha=
nge out of her clothes.

Donald was having a pool party at Mar-a-Lago. There were about 50 models an=
d 30 men. There were girls in the pools, splashing around. For some reason =
Donald seemed a little smitten with me. He just started talking to me and n=
obody else.

He suddenly took me by the hand, and he started to show me around the mansi=
on. He asked me if I had a domain.com with me. I said no. I hadn=92t intended=
 to swim. He took me into a room and opened drawers and asked me to put on =
a domain.com.

=96Rowanne Brewer Lane, former companion

Ms. Brewer Lane, at the time a 26-year-old model, did as Mr. Trump asked. =
=93I went into the bathroom and tried one on,=94 she recalled. It was a bik=
ini. =93I came out, and he said, =91Wow.=92 =94

Mr. Trump, then 44 and in the midst of his first divorce, decided to show h=
er off to the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Fla. =93He bro=
ught me out to the pool and said, =91That is a stunning Trump girl, isn=92t=
 it?=92 =94 Ms. Brewer Lane said.

Donald Trump and women: The words evoke a familiar cascade of casual insult=
s, hurled from the safe distance of a Twitter account, a radio show or a ca=
mpaign podium. This is the public treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, the=
 presumptive Republican nominee for president: degrading, impersonal, perfo=
rmed. =93That must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees,=94 he t=
old a female contestant on =93The Apprentice.=94 Rosie O=92Donnell, he said=
, had a =93fat, ugly face.=94 A lawyer who needed to pump milk for a newbor=
n? =93Disgusting,=94 he said.

But the 1990 episode at Mar-a-Lago that Ms. Brewer Lane described was diffe=
rent: a debasing face-to-face encounter between Mr. Trump and a young woman=
 he hardly knew. This is the private treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, =
the up-close and more intimate encounters.

The New York Times interviewed dozens of women who had worked with or for M=
r. Trump over the past four decades, in the worlds of real estate, modeling=
 and pageants; women who had dated him or interacted with him socially; and=
 women and men who had closely observed his conduct since his adolescence. =
In all, more than 50 interviews were conducted over the course of six weeks=
.

Their accounts =97 many relayed here in their own words =97 reveal domain.com=
e romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, a shrewd relia=
nce on ambitious women, and unsettling workplace conduct, according to the =
interviews, as well as court records and written recollections. The interac=
tions occurred in his offices at Trump Tower, at his homes, at construction=
 sites and backstage at beauty pageants. They appeared to be fleeting, unim=
portant moments to him, but they left lasting impressions on the women who =
experienced them.

What emerges from the interviews is a complex, at times contradictory portr=
ait of a wealthy, well-known and provocative man and the women around him, =
one that defies simple categorization. Some women found him gracious and en=
couraging. He promoted several to the loftiest heights of his company, a da=
ring move for a major real estate developer at the time.

He simultaneously nurtured women=92s careers and mocked their physical appe=
arance. =93You like your candy,=94 he told an overweight female executive w=
ho oversaw the construction of his headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. He co=
uld be lewd one moment and gentlemanly the next.

In an interview, Mr. Trump described himself as a champion of women, someon=
e who took pride in hiring them and was in awe of their work ethic. =93It w=
ould just seem,=94 he said, =93that there was something that they want to r=
eally prove.=94

Pressed on the women=92s claims, Mr. Trump disputed many of the details, su=
ch as asking Ms. Brewer Lane to put on a domain.com. =93A lot of things get m=
ade up over the years,=94 he said. =93I have always treated women with grea=
t respect. And women will tell you that.=94

But in many cases there was an unmistakable dynamic at play: Mr. Trump had =
the power, and the women did not. He had celebrity. He had wealth. He had c=
onnections. Even after he had behaved crudely toward them, some of the wome=
n sought his assistance with their careers or remained by his side.

For Ms. Brewer Lane, her introduction to Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago was the st=
art of a whirlwind romance =97 a heady blur of helicopter rides and high-en=
d hotel rooms and flashing cameras.

=93It was intimidating,=94 she said. =93He was Donald Trump, obviously.=94

Boarding School =91Ladies=92 Man=92

It started at the New York Military Academy, a small, severe boarding schoo=
l 90 minutes north of New York City. Strictly enforced rules prohibited gir=
ls from setting foot on the all-boys campus unless it was a special occasio=
n. And on those special occasions, young Donald Trump paid careful mind to =
the kind of girls he brought to school. They had to be gorgeous =97 10s, in=
 his future parlance.

=93Donald was extremely sensitive to whether or not the women he invited to=
 campus were pretty,=94 recalled George White, a fellow student in the clas=
s of 1964.

=93For Donald,=94 he added, =93it=92s display.=94

He steadily built an image as a young playboy amid the deprivations of a si=
ngle-sex military school, where most boys craved but rarely enjoyed the com=
pany of a girl. By senior year, his classmates had crowned him =93ladies=92=
 man=94 in the yearbook, a nod to the volume of his dates.

He wasn=92t bringing the same girl. He had a variety of girls coming up. Do=
nald was bringing in very pretty women, very sophisticated women and very w=
ell-dressed women. You could always tell they were of a higher class.

=96George White, high school classmate

Asked how he had earned the =93ladies=92 man=94 title, Mr. Trump at first d=
emurred. =93I better not tell you =97 I=92ll get myself in trouble,=94 he s=
aid. He later elaborated, saying he had =93a great feeling=94 and =93a grea=
t like=94 for women.

The Alpha Trump

Mr. Trump grew up with an influential role model for how to deal with women=
: Fred C. Trump, his powerful and unyielding father.

The elder Mr. Trump exerted control no matter how big or small the decision=
, as Ivana Zelnickova learned over dinner one night in the late 1970s. Her =
boyfriend, Donald Trump, had invited her to join his siblings and parents a=
t Tavern on the Green, the ornate restaurant in Central Park.

When the waiter came to take orders, Ivana made the mistake of asking for w=
hat she wanted. Fred Trump set her straight, she recalled in a previously u=
npublished interview with Michael D=92Antonio, the author of =93The Truth A=
bout Trump.=94

Fred would order steak. Then Donald would order steak. =85 Everybody order =
steak. I told the waiter, =93I would like to have fish.=94 O.K., so I could=
 have the fish. And Fred would say to the waiter: =93No, Ivana is not going=
 to have a fish. She is going to have a steak.=94 I said, =93No, I=92m goin=
g to have my fish.=94 And Donald would come home and say, =93Ivana, why wou=
ld you have a fish instead of a steak?=94 I say, =93Because I=92m not going=
 to be told by somebody to have something which I don=92t want.=94

=96Ivana Trump, ex-wife

Mr. Trump defended his father=92s conduct. =93He would=92ve said that out o=
f love,=94 he said. If his father had overruled her fish order, Mr. Trump s=
aid, =93he would have said that only on the basis that he thought, =91That =
would be better for her.=92 =94

The elder Mr. Trump did not hide his more traditional views on gender. When=
 his son hired a woman, Barbara A. Res<<<link>>>=
, as his head of construction in the 1980s, Fred Trump was mystified and an=
noyed.

Fred did not like the idea that Donald had hired me. =93A woman?=94 Donald =
told me that. But I could tell by the way Fred treated me. He used to say t=
hat all the time: =93You don=92t know what you are talking about.=94 When I=
 would complain to Donald about Fred, he would say, =93Fred didn=92t want m=
e to hire you or didn=92t think it was a woman=92s job.=94

=96Barbara A. Res, former Trump executive

Mr. Trump said it was a different era. =93My father,=94 he said, =93probabl=
y never would have seen a woman in that position.=94

Mr. Trump still holds up his parents as models, praising his stay-at-home m=
other for understanding and accommodating a husband who worked almost nonst=
op.

=93My mother was always fine with it,=94 he said, recalling her =93brillian=
t=94 management of the situation. =93If something got interrupted because h=
e was going to inspect a housing site or something, she would handle that s=
o beautifully.=94

=93She was an ideal woman,=94 he said.

The Company of Women

With his purchase of the Miss Universe Organization, Mr. Trump was now in t=
he business of young, beautiful women.

They craved his advice and approval, a fact he seemed to understand well.

Temple Taggart, the 21-year-old Miss Utah, was startled by how forward he w=
as with young contestants like her in 1997, his first year as the owner of =
Miss USA, a branch of the beauty pageant organization. As she recalls it, h=
e introduced himself in an unusually intimate manner.

He kissed me directly on the lips. I thought, =93Oh my God, gross.=94 He wa=
s married to Marla Maples at the time. I think there were a few other girls=
 that he kissed on the mouth. I was like =93Wow, that=92s inappropriate.=94

=96Temple Taggart, 1997 Miss Utah USA

Mr. Trump disputes this, saying he is reluctant to kiss strangers on the li=
ps. But Ms. Taggart said it was not an isolated incident.

At the gala celebration after the show, she said, Mr. Trump immediately zer=
oed in on her, telling her how much he liked her style and inviting her to =
domain.com him in New York to talk about her future. Soon enough, she said, he d=
elivered another unwelcome kiss on her lips, this time in Trump Tower. Afte=
r boasting of his connections to elite modeling agencies, he advised her to=
 lie about her age to get ahead in the industry, she said.

=93 =91We=92re going to have to tell them you=92re 17,=92 =94 Ms. Taggart r=
ecalled him telling her, =93because in his mind, 21 is too old. I was like,=
 =91No, we=92re not going to do that.=92 =94

His level of involvement in the pageants was unexpected, and his judgments,=
 the contestants said, could be harsh. Carrie Prejean, who was 21 when she =
participated in the Miss USA contest in 2015 as Miss California, was surpri=
sed to find Mr. Trump personally evaluating the women at rehearsal. =93We w=
ere told to put on our opening number outfits =97 they were nearly as revea=
ling as our swimsuits =97 and line up for him onstage,=94 she wrote in her =
memoir, =93Still Standing.=94

Donald Trump walked out with his entourage and inspected us closer than any=
 general ever inspected a platoon. He would stop in front of a girl, look h=
er up and down, and say, =93Hmmm.=94 Then he would go on and do the same th=
ing to the next girl. He took notes on a little pad as he went along. After=
 he did this, Trump said: =93O.K. I want all the girls to come forward.=94 =
=85

Donald Trump looked at Miss Alabama.

=93Come here,=94 he said.

She took one more step forward.

=93Tell me, who=92s the most beautiful woman here?=94

Miss Alabama=92s eyes swam around.

=93Besides me?=94 she said. =93Uh, I like Arkansas. She=92s sweet.=94

=93I don=92t care if she=92s sweet,=94 Donald Trump said. =93Is she hot?=94=
 =85

It became clear that the point of the whole exercise was for him to divide =
the room between girls he personally found attractive and those he did not.=
 Many of the girls found the exercise humiliating. Some of the girls were s=
obbing backstage after he left, devastated to have failed even before the c=
ompetition really began to impress =93The Donald.=94

=96Carrie Prejean, 2015 Miss California USA

Mr. Trump, in an interview, said he would =93never do that.=94 Such behavio=
r, he said, would bruise egos and hurt feelings. =93I wouldn=92t hurt domain.com=
e,=94 he said. =93That=92s hurtful to people.=94

A Preoccupation With Bodies

Mr. Trump was not just fixated on the appearance of the women around him. H=
e possessed an almost compulsive need to talk about it.

Inside the Trump Organization, the company that manages his various busines=
ses, he occasionally interrupted routine discussions of business to opine o=
n women=92s figures. Barbara Res, his construction executive, remembered a =
meeting in which she and Mr. Trump interviewed an architect for a project i=
n the Los Angeles area. Out of the blue, she said, Mr. Trump evaluated the =
fitness of women in Marina del Rey, Calif. =93They take care of their asses=
,=94 he said.

=93The architect and I didn=92t know where he was coming from,=94 Ms. Res s=
aid. Years later, after she had gained a significant amount of weight, Ms. =
Res endured a stinging workplace observation about her own body from Mr. Tr=
ump. =93 =91You like your candy,=92 =94 she recalled him telling her. =93It=
 was him reminding me that I was overweight.=94

Her colleague Louise Sunshine experienced similar observations from Mr. Tru=
mp when she gained weight. But she saw it as friendly encouragement, not a =
cruel insult. =93He thought I looked much better thin,=94 she said. =93He w=
ould remind me of how beautiful I was.=94

Whenever possible, Mr. Trump wanted his visitors to see his most attractive=
 employees, as Ms. Res learned.

We had a big meeting once. I grabbed one of the women in the office and sen=
t her in to get lunch orders. Donald said, =93Not her.=94 She didn=92t look=
 great. He got another woman to take the lunch orders. That was purely abou=
t looks. He wanted the people in that room to think that all the women who =
worked for him were beautiful.

=96Ms. Res

Mr. Trump frequently sought assurances =97 at times from strangers =97 that=
 the women in his life were beautiful. During the 1997 Miss Teen USA pagean=
t, he sat in the audience as his teenage daughter, Ivanka, helped to host t=
he event from onstage. He turned to Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee, Miss Un=
iverse at the time, and asked for her opinion of his daughter=92s body.

=93 =91Don=92t you think my daughter=92s hot? She=92s hot, right?=92 =94 Ms=
. Lee recalled him saying. =91I was like, =91Really?=92 That=92s just weird=
. She was 16. That=92s creepy.=94

Ms. Brewer Lane, who dated Mr. Trump for several months in 1990 and early 1=
991, said it did not take long for him to domain.com her view on the attractiv=
eness of two of his previous romantic partners, Marla Maples and Ivana Trum=
p.

He did ask me, on a scale of 1 to 10, what I thought of Marla. I thought th=
at was very boyish of him. He asked me the same thing about Ivana. I said, =
obviously, she is your wife. A beautiful woman. What could you say but a 10=
? I am not going to judge your wife.

=96Ms. Brewer Lane

Mr. Trump said he did not know Ms. Brewer Lane very well, despite dating he=
r. =93I wouldn=92t have asked anybody about how they rate other women,=94 h=
e said.

Kissing, and Telling Everyone

He liked to brag about his sexual prowess and his desirability as a date, n=
o matter who was around.

Barbara J. Fife, a deputy mayor under David N. Dinkins, New York=92s mayor =
in the early 1990s, was not especially close to Mr. Trump. But that did not=
 stop him from telling her why he was in such a hurry one day as he sat in =
her office at City Hall.

=93I have this great date tonight with a model for Victoria=92s Secret,=94 =
Ms. Fife recalled him telling her.

=93I saw it as immature, quite honestly,=94 she said.

At his office in Trump Tower, Mr. Trump seemed eager for his colleagues to =
hear about his new companion, Ms. Maples. When The New York Post feasted on=
 her supposed satisfaction with him in bed, captured in the headline =93Bes=
t Sex I=92ve Ever Had,=94 Mr. Trump was unabashed, Ms. Res said.

He absolutely loved that. He waved it around the office. =93Did you see thi=
s?=94 Everyone who worked there were kind of horrified. We all thought it m=
ade him look bad. He didn=92t.

=96Ms. Res

Mr. Trump denies boasting about the headline. He seems more bashful these d=
ays, saying he cannot recall how many women he has dated. =93Not as many as=
 people would think,=94 he said. =93I=92m not somebody that really loved th=
e dating process.=94

Women as Trusted Colleagues

To build his business, Mr. Trump turned to women for a simple reason: They =
worked hard =97 often harder than men, he told them.

When Mr. Trump hired Ms. Res to oversee the construction of Trump Tower, he=
 invited her to his apartment on Fifth Avenue and explained that he wanted =
her to be his =93Donna Trump=94 on the project, she said. Few women had rea=
ched such stature in the industry.

He said: =93I know you=92re a woman in a man=92s world. And while men tend =
to be better than women, a good woman is better than 10 good men.=94 =85 He=
 thought he was really complimenting me.

=96Ms. Res

He entrusted several women in his company with enormous responsibility =97 =
once they had proven themselves worthy and loyal. Ms. Sunshine had little e=
xperience in real estate, but as a top campaign fund-raiser for Gov. Hugh C=
arey of New York, she had fulfilled a lifelong wish for Mr. Trump: She secu=
red him a vanity license plate with his initials, DJT, which adorned his li=
mousine for years.

It=92s something he had wanted since his father bought him toy cars. By som=
e gift of God, I was able to obtain it for him. He was beyond thrilled. And=
 I became the woman in his life who could do no wrong. And he became the ma=
n in my life who was going to be my mentor.

=96Louise Sunshine, former Trump executive

Ms. Sunshine worked for Mr. Trump for 15 years, becoming a major New York r=
eal estate figure in her own right. Ms. Res remained at the company for 12 =
years, left after a disagreement over a project and then returned as a cons=
ultant for six more years. Both expressed gratitude for the chances Mr. Tru=
mp had taken on them.

In a rough-and-tumble industry thoroughly dominated by men, Mr. Trump=92s o=
ffice stood out for its diversity, recalled Alan Lapidus, an influential ar=
chitect who designed the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City.

He is a lot more complicated than the cartoon character. The top people in =
his company were women, like Barbara Res. For any company to hire a woman a=
s chief of construction was actually startling. I don=92t know of a single =
other developer who had a woman in that position. The respect for women was=
 always there. That=92s why, in spite of the comments he makes now =97 and =
God knows why he says these things =97 when he was building his empire, the=
 backbone was women.

=96Alan Lapidus, architect

Dismissive Nicknames

To women who had climbed to positions of power outside his company, Mr. Tru=
mp=92s behavior could feel like a jarring throwback.

Alair A. Townsend was for a time the highest-ranking woman inside New York=
=92s City Hall during the Koch administration, with the title of deputy may=
or for economic development. But when Mr. Trump called her, she said, her p=
osition seemed less relevant to him than her gender.

He was dismissive. It was always, =93Hon,=94 =93Dear.=94 Things he wouldn=
=92t have said to a man. It was designed to make you feel small. And he did=
 that repeatedly.

=96Alair A. Townsend, former deputy mayor

It was an unthinking domain.com when he interacted with women, colleagues said. =
=93At Trump Tower,=94 said Ms. Res, his longtime colleague, =93he called me=
 Honey Bunch.=94

Wife and Partner, and Regret

No single figure better encapsulated the paradoxes of Mr. Trump=92s treatme=
nt of women in the workplace than his first wife, Ivana.

He entrusted her with major pieces of a corporate empire and gave her the t=
itles to match. She was the president of Trump=92s Castle, a major casino i=
n Atlantic City, and the Plaza Hotel, the storied complex on Central Park S=
outh in Manhattan. =93She ran that hotel,=94 Ms. Res said. =93And she ran i=
t well.=94

But he compensated her as a spouse, not a high-level employee, paying her a=
n annual salary of $1 for the Trump=92s Castle job, according to her tax do=
cuments. And he grew to resent her outsize role. By the end of their marria=
ge, Mr. Trump wrote in his 1997 book, =93The Art of the Comeback,=94 he reg=
retted having allowed her to run his businesses.

My big mistake with Ivana was taking her out of the role of wife and allowi=
ng her to run one of my casinos in Atlantic City, then the Plaza Hotel. The=
 problem was, work was all she wanted to talk about. When I got home at nig=
ht, rather than talking about the softer subjects of life, she wanted to te=
ll me how well the Plaza was doing, or what a great day the casino had.

I will never again give a wife responsibility within my business.

=96Donald J. Trump, presumptive Republican nominee

He seems to have kept his word. His current wife, Melania, has marketed her=
 own lines of beauty products and jewelry. But Mr. Trump remains mostly uni=
nvolved in her work. After calling it =93very successful,=94 he struggled t=
o describe it.

=93What is it on television with the sales?=94 he asked. =93What do they ca=
ll that? Not Home Shopping, the other one.=94

Accusations and Denials

Once his first marriage started to collapse, Mr. Trump faced his most serio=
us allegations of aggression toward women.

When =93Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,=94 by the journalis=
t Harry Hurt III, was released in 1993, it included a description of a nigh=
t in which Mr. Trump was said to have raped Ivana in a fit of rage. It also=
 included a statement from Ivana that Mr. Trump=92s lawyers insisted be pla=
ced in the front of the book. In the statement, she described an occasion o=
f =93marital relations=94 during which =93I felt violated, as the love and =
tenderness, which he normally exhibited toward me, was absent.=94

=93During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, =
I stated that my husband had raped me,=94 the statement said. =93I referred=
 to this as a =91rape,=92 but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a=
 literal or criminal sense.=94

Mr. Trump denied raping Ivana, and she did not respond to a request for com=
ment. After the allegation re-emerged in the news media last year, Ivana sa=
id in a statement<<<link>>
nald-trump-aide-apologizes-for-saying-you-cant-rape-your-spouse/>, =93The s=
tory is totally without domain.com.=94

In the early 1990s, Jill Harth and her boyfriend at the time, George Houran=
ey, worked with Mr. Trump on a beauty pageant in Atlantic City, and later a=
ccused Mr. Trump of inappropriate behavior toward Ms. Harth during their bu=
siness dealings. In a 1996 deposition, Ms. Harth described their initial me=
eting with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower.

Donald Trump stared at me throughout that meeting. He stared at me even whi=
le George was giving his presentation. =85 In the middle of it he says to G=
eorge, =93Are you sleeping with her?=94 Meaning me. And George looked a lit=
tle shocked and he said, =93Well, yeah.=94 And he goes, =93Well, for the we=
ekend or what?=94

=96Jill Harth, former pageant promoter

Mr. Houraney said in a recent interview that he was shocked by Mr. Trump=92=
s response after he made clear that he and Ms. Harth were monogamous.

=93He said: =91Well, there=92s always a first time. I am going after her,=
=92 =94 Mr. Houraney recalled, adding: =93I thought the man was joking. I l=
aughed. He said, =91I am serious.=92 =94

By the time the three of them were having dinner at the Oak Room of the Pla=
za Hotel the next night, Mr. Trump=92s advances had turned physical, Ms. Ha=
rth said in the deposition.

=93Basically he name-dropped throughout that dinner, when he wasn=92t gropi=
ng me under the table,=94 she testified. =93Let me just say, this was a ver=
y traumatic thing working for him.=94

Ms. Harth, who declined to comment, gave the deposition in connection with =
a domain.com that alleged Mr. Trump had failed to meet his obligations in a bu=
siness partnership. Mr. Trump settled that case but denied wrongdoing. Ms. =
Harth withdrew her own domain.com against Mr. Trump alleging unwanted advances=
, but she has stood by her original claims.

Mr. Trump said it was Ms. Harth who had pursued him, and his office shared =
email messages in which Ms. Harth, over the past year, thanked Mr. Trump fo=
r helping her personally and professionally and expressed support for his p=
residential candidacy.

Defending His Record

Mr. Trump says the world misunderstands his relationship with women.

He sees himself as a promoter of women =97 a man whose business deals, like=
 the purchase of the struggling Miss Universe pageant, have given them unto=
ld opportunities for employment and advancement. =93Hundreds and hundreds o=
f women, thousands of women, are the better for it,=94 he said.

He has groomed his daughter, Ivanka, to run his company. And as a chief exe=
cutive, he said, he admires women for a work ethic that can exceed that of =
the men around them. Mr. Trump recalled a telling exchange with a female wo=

I=92ve said, =93Why don=92t you go home and take it easy now, just go relax=
.=94 =93No, Mr. Trump, I have to finish this job.=94 And I said, =93Boy, yo=
u really are a worker.=94 And it would just seem that there was something, =
that they want to really prove something, which is wonderful.

=96Mr. Trump

Several women who have held positions of power within the Trump Organizatio=
n in recent years said they had never known Mr. Trump to objectify women or=
 treat them with disrespect.

=93I think there are mischaracterizations about him,=94 said Jill Martin, a=
 vice president and assistant counsel at the company. Ms. Martin said Mr. T=
rump had enthusiastically supported her decision to have two children over =
the past five years, even when it meant working from home and scaling back =
on business travel.

=93That=92s hard with women lawyers,=94 she said. =93For me, he=92s made it=
 a situation where I can really excel at my job and still devote the time n=
ecessary for my family.=94

After competing in the 2015 Miss USA pageant, Laura Kirilova Chukanov, a Bu=
lgarian immigrant who lived in Utah, met with Mr. Trump in his New York off=
ice and explained that she wanted to make a documentary about her home coun=
try. Mr. Trump encouraged the project and followed through on a promise to =
put her in touch with his production company.

=93He genuinely wanted to know what I wanted to do with my life and how he =
could help,=94 Ms. Chukanov said.

A Damaging Critique

But when Mr. Trump lost confidence in women, he could inflict lasting damag=
e on their lives.

After Alicia Machado won the 1996 Miss Universe title, something very human=
 happened: She gained weight. Mr. Trump did not keep his critique of her ch=
anging body quiet =97 he publicly shamed her, she said.

I told the president of Miss Universe, a very sweet woman, I said I need so=
me time to recuperate, to rest, to exercise, to eat right. I asked them to =
bring me a doctor to help me =97 to have a special diet and get exercise, a=
nd they said yes. They took me to New York, installed me in a hotel. The ne=
xt day, they took me to the gym, and I=92m exposed to 90 media outlets. Don=
ald Trump was there. I had no idea that would happen.

I was about to cry in that moment with all the cameras there. I said, =93I =
don=92t want to do this, Mr. Trump.=94 He said, =93I don=92t care.=94

=96Alicia Machado, 1996 Miss Universe

Mr. Trump said he had pushed her to lose weight. =93To that, I will plead g=
uilty,=94 he said, expressing no regret for his tactics.

But the humiliation, Ms. Machado said, was unbearable. =93After that episod=
e, I was sick, anorexia and bulimia for five years,=94 she said. =93Over th=
e past 20 years, I=92ve gone to a lot of psychologists to combat this.=94
