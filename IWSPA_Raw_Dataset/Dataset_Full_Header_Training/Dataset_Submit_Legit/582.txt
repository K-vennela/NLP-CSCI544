*NEW VIDEO: On Same Day Trump Becomes Presumptive GOP Nominee, Congressman
Heck Reiterates Support *

*View video of Congressman Heck=E2=80=99s comments here
<<<link>>>*

Las Vegas, NV =E2=80=93 Last night, Donald Trump became the presumptive Rep=
ublican
nominee with his win in the Indiana Republican Primary. Coincidentally,
hours earlier, Congressman Heck gave a testy television interview where he
whined about Catherine Cortez Masto telling the truth about his
anti-immigrant voting record. Laughably, Congressman Heck then doubled down
on his support for one of the most anti-immigrant candidates for President
in recent history, Donald Trump.

When pressed by KSNV=E2=80=99s Jeff Gillan if he would support Trump if he =
wins the
nomination, Congressman Heck said, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll support whoever th=
e nominee is=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D
Well, Republican voters, and the Republican National Committee
<<<link>>>, have spoken. The
nominee is Trump.

=E2=80=9CCongressman Heck doubled down on his support for nominee Donald Tr=
ump on
the same day Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee for
President,=E2=80=9D said Zach Hudson, spokesperson for Catherine Cortez Mas=
to for
Senate. =E2=80=9CNo matter who emerges from the Republican primary for Sena=
te,
Sharron Angle or Congressman Heck, Nevadans will have a Republican nominee
who shares Donald Trump=E2=80=99s anti-immigrant agenda that would tear fam=
ilies
apart. Whether it's Trump-Angle, or Trump-Heck, Nevadans will reject this
anti-immigrant ticket and elect Catherine Cortez Masto to the Senate to
focus on solving problems like passing comprehensive immigration reform,
raising the minimum wage, and creating an economy that works for everyone,
not just billionaires like Donald Trump.=E2=80=9D
