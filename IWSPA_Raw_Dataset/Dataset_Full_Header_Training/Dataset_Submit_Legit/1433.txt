I don't think that would be possible. They don't have tickets to start the videos yet.

I think tonight / tomorrow would be the best time to release, considering that Cruz and Rubio are both back doing media today.

Subject: Endorsement Videos

Digital hasn't gotten tickets for videos of Cruz and Rubio trashing Trump when they endorse him (which Rubio basically just did). Are these things you all intend to do/use?
