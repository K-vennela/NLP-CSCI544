Hispanic Legislative Caucus Endorses Catherine Cortez Masto for U.S. Senate

Highlight her commitment to fighting for comprehensive immigration reform,
unlike her opponents Congressman Heck and Sharron Angle who support Trump=
=E2=80=99s
anti-immigrant policies

Las Vegas, NV =E2=80=93 This morning at the Latin Chamber of Commerce, Neva=
da=E2=80=99s
Hispanic Legislative Caucus announced its endorsement of former Attorney
General Catherine Cortez Masto to be Nevada=E2=80=99s next U.S. Senator.

=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m honored to have the support of a group that represents=
 one of Nevada=E2=80=99s
most critical communities,=E2=80=9D said Cortez Masto. =E2=80=9CMy grandfat=
her emigrated
from Mexico and it is because of his hard work that I have the opportunity
to become Nevada=E2=80=99s next Senator, and the first Latina Senator in Am=
erican
history. We need to ensure that every Nevadan has the opportunity to
succeed, regardless of where they come from, and that is what I will fight
for in the U.S. Senate. Unfortunately, my opponents, Sharron Angle and
Congressman Heck, support their Party=E2=80=99s anti-immigrant policies. An=
gle and
Congressman Heck both would end DACA and DAPA, repeal birthright
citizenship, and both support Donald Trump. In the Senate, I will focus on
solving problems like passing comprehensive immigration reform, and, unlike
my opponents, I will always stand up for Nevada=E2=80=99s Latino community =
against
anti-immigrant extremists like Donald Trump.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CCatherine knows how to take on tough problems and put partisan pol=
itics
aside to get things done for Nevadans,=E2=80=9D said Assemblywoman Olivia D=
iaz,
Chair of the Hispanic Legislative Caucus. =E2=80=9CWhether it was taking on=
 the Big
Banks to help struggling homeowners, increasing protections for our
seniors, or cracking down on violent criminals and sex traffickers,
Catherine has made a career of bipartisan problem-solving. I know she will
continue to stand up for Nevadans in the U.S. Senate and fight for the
issues that matter to every community, especially the Hispanic community.=
=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CThe choice for Catherine over her opponents, Congressman Heck and =
Sharron
Angle, could not have been clearer,=E2=80=9D said Assemblyman Nelson
Araujo,Vice-Chair of the Caucus. =E2=80=9CCatherine will stand up for Nevad=
a=E2=80=99s
growing Hispanic community, unlike Congressman Heck and Sharron Angle, who
support an anti-immigrant, xenophobe, Donald Trump, to be the next
President of the United States. Just like Donald Trump,. Congressman Heck
and Sharron Angle would push policies that would tear immigrant families
apart and keep millions in the shadows. We need leaders who will reject
Donald Trump and his policies, not Congressman Heck or Sharron Angle who
support Trump=E2=80=99s anti-immigrant agenda.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CWhen I founded this caucus 10 years ago, I was one of 3 Hispanics =
in the
Nevada State Legislature -- today, we have tripled that number -- and have
the opportunity to elect the first Latina U.S. Senator in American
history,=E2=80=9D said Mo Denis, founder of the Hispanic Legislative Caucus=
. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m
honored to be standing here today with my fellow Legislators to announce
our support for Catherine and our commitment to electing her as Nevada=E2=
=80=99s
next U.S. Senator.=E2=80=9D
