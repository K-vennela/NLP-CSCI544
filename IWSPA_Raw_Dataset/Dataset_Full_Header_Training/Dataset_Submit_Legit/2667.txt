OrganizationTalking Points on the Ted Cruz / Carly Fiorina Ticket

*         This is a desperate attempt by a desperate campaign to change the narrative after netting only a single delegate in last night's contests.

*         By selecting a VP candidate when he is less than halfway to the nomination, Ted Cruz is even more delusional than John Kasich, who has only won his home state, and Marco Rubio, who gave a victory speech after a third place finish in Iowa.

*         It's fitting that Senator Cruz, best known for shutting down the U.S. government, would select Carly Fiorina as his VP, best known for almost shutting down a great U.S. company.

*         As CEO of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina:

o   Cut HP's stock value in half

o   Laid off 30,000 workers<<<link>>> after an ill-advised merger with Compaq

o   Outsourced American jobs<<<link>>> to other countries

o   Sold computer equipment to Iran<<<link>>> in violation of U.S. sanctions

o   Received a $40 million golden parachute<<<link>>,28804,1848501_1848500_1848417,00.html> upon being fired

o   Earned status<<<link>>> as one of the "Worst American CEOs of all Time"

*         Don't be fooled: Cruz and Fiorina are not "outsiders." Cruz has been in politics for decades and has collected a government paycheck since 1999, and Fiorina is only an "outsider" because California voters overwhelmingly rejected her candidacy, even in a banner year for Republicans.

Here's what some others have had to say about Fiorina's disastrous tenure at HP:

"A consummate self-promoter, Fiorina was busy pontificating on the lecture domain.com and posing for magazine covers while her company floundered. She paid herself handsome bonuses and perks while laying off thousands of employees to cut costs. The merger Fiorina orchestrated with Compaq in 2015 was widely seen as a failure. She was ousted in 2005." -CNBC Portfolio's list of worst CEOs of all time<<<link>>>

"The stock price dropped by 50% only to rally 10% on the announcement of her firing. She fired 28,000 people before she herself was fired, departing with the 21 million dollar golden parachute that is financing her campaign." -Arianna Packard, granddaughter of the late HP co-founder David Packard<<<link>>>

"She walked into a fundamentally sound, healthy, vibrant company and had a disastrous tour of duty. She sliced shareholder wealth in half and had a reign of terror that was infamous for its scapegoating, finger-pointing culture." -Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management<<<link>>>

"Call her the anti-Steve Jobs. During her 1999-2005 tenure as CEO of Hewlett-Packard, Carly Fiorina proved that she could reverse decades of geek goodwill and alienate customers like no one else. She oversaw the spin-off of HP's well-respected instruments and medical equipment business, outsourced its beloved calculator division, then issued 7,000 pink slips. Under Fiorina's tenure, HP brought in more profits from printer ink than PCs." -InfoWorld in their rankings of the worst tech flops off all time<<<link>>>
