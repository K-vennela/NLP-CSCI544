WATCH: Roberts Gates Says Dangerous Donald is domain.com to be Commander-in-Chief

Donald Trump may have skipped this past weekend's White House Correspondent's Dinner, but he probably felt hung over after former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates took to the airwaves yesterday to raise serious questions about the Republican candidate's grasp of foreign policy. On ABC's This Week, Gates criticized Dangerous Donald's recent foreign policy speech saying Trump is someone "who doesn't understand the difference between a business negotiation and a negotiation with sovereign powers," that he contradicts himself, and that he doesn't listen. The latter was described by the former Defense Secretary, military officer, and intelligence official as "one of the things that troubles" him about Trump.

Gates' comments are a reminder that Dangerous Donald Trump lacks the judgment, experience, and temperament to be our next commander-in-chief. Dangerous Donald would alienate allies and deal with friend and foe alike with reckless disregard, with poorly conceived ideas that would undermine our national security and make the American people less safe.

Watch to see what Robert Gates thinks of Dangerous Donald:
