Subject: HIT ON MCCAIN TODAY

Hi Sadie, we want to hit McCain on what he said today on CNN. Any concerns with the below?

SL: Senator McCain: "Oh, I don't know" if Trump should retract "rapists" comment

Body:

"Oh, I don't know." That was Senator John McCain's response this morning when asked on CNN if he thought Donald Trump should take back his dangerous and divisive comments calling Mexicans 'rapists.'

See the exchange below:

"By refusing to condemn Trump's unconscionable remarks, Senator McCain will own them from now until Election Day. The fact that Senator McCain is supporting Trump and standing by his discriminatory comments about Hispanic-Americans confirms that the GOP is now the party of Trump." -- OrganizationNational Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach
