Hi all - We'll send this out to Factivists tomorrow. Let me know if you have any flags.

Hey there, NAME -

After another week of getting used to the idea of Donald Trump as their party's presumptive nominee, Republicans are now trying to convince the rest of us that there's nothing out of the ordinary about Trump's candidacy and that supporting him is business as usual.

We'll be blunt: There is noting typical about Donald Trump or the campaign he's running.

Typical candidates are held to certain standards of decency. Not Trump.

<<link>>

Typical candidates are expected to release their tax returns or risk facing serious questions from the press and voters. Not Trump.

<<link>>

Typical candidates understand there are certain lines we don't cross as Americans. Not Trump.

<<link>>

Donald Trump is a uniquely dangerous candidate, and we can't forget that.

<<link>>

As President Obama put it:

<<link>>

As Factivists, it's our job to get the word out about just how high the stakes are this November and how important it is that we elect Democrats to stop Trump and his fellow Republicans. So please retweet and help us spread the facts.

Thanks for playing your part, NAME. Talk to you next week.
