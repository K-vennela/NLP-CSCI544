SL: Democrats Remain United "New poll shows Democratic disunity is a myth"

Body: A new CBS/NYT poll<<<link>>+at+0&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=https%3A%2F%2domain.com%2F&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=Politics&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article> shows that Democrats are more united today than in May of 2008, disproving the myth of Democratic disunity the latest indication that the party is united and energized heading into the 2015 election.

The poll showed that more than 70 percent of both Senator Sanders' supporters and Secretary Clinton's supporters would vote for the other Democratic candidate in a general election.  and  and roughly the same number and 72 percent of Senator Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton, and 78 percent of Senator Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton. In May of 2008, polling found only 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for then-Senator Obama, who was eventually later elected to in a landslide victory.

Furthermore, the poll shows that 80 percent of Democrats are "mostly hopeful" about the future of the Democratic Party, as opposed to only 55 percent of Republicans. 43 percent of Republicans are also "mostly discouraged" about the future of the Republican party.

This echoes what we've seen in domain.com poll after domain.com poll after domain.com poll:

Indiana<<<link>>>:

Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they've been energized by the nomination contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But nearly 6 in 10 Republicans say they think their party has been divided by the battle being fought by billionaire Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut<<<link>>>:

Democratic voters, unlike Republicans, said the primary season had energized their party. Two-thirds or more of Democrats who cast ballots in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut said their party was more energized, while less than one-third said it was divided, domain.com polls showed.
New York<<<link>>>:

Almost 6 in 10 New York Republican voters say their party has been divided by the nomination process, while only 3 in 10 Democratic voters say the same about their party's primaries. Less than 4 in 10 GOP voters say they've been energized, domain.com polls show, compared with two-thirds of Democratic voters who say that about their side.

It's clear that heading into the 2015 elections, Democrats are united and energized, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged.
