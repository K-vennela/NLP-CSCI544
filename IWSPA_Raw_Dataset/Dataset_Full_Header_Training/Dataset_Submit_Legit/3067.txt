Senator Grassley Reaches Milestone in Supreme Court Obstructionism
According to a release by Americans United for Change, today marks the 42nd=

Brad Woodhouse, President, Americans United for Change: "Never before has t=

cancy because it was an election year. Grassley would have us believe that =
Presidents aren't elected for four year terms, but three years and a couple=

Today, former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn said the Senate Judiciary Committ=

ics/first-draft/2016/04/27/tom-coburn-ex-senator-says-merrick-garland-shoul=

"Despite once being among the most conservative members of the Senate, Mr. =
Coburn took pride in his ability to work with Democrats. He made it clear W=
ednesday that he believed Republicans were motivated by politics in refusin=
g to consider Mr. Obama's pick to replace the conservative-leaning Justice =
Antonin Scalia, who died in February."

Sen. Coburn (R-OK): ""If I was running things, I'd have had a vote and vote=
 him down...The presidents have a right to have their nominees considered. =
And if it had been a Republican president, I'm sure they'd have been consid=

 the Senate Judiciary Committee and are awaiting a final vote on the Senate=
 floor. 'We are urging our colleagues to do their jobs,' Schumer said from =
