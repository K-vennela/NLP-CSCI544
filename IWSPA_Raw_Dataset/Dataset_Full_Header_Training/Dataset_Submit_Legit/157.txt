Starting at 21:25 in 5:00 hour, Trump is pushed on the fact that the U.S. military commander for South Korea said it would be more expensive to have U.S. troops in the U.S. instead of on bases in South Korea, Trump says "then maybe we don't need them."

Trump on Situation Room

Part 3

Pivot to the general?

-          Surprised that Hillary Clinton hasn't wrapped it up yet

-          "There's been a little flip. I thought that I'd be going longer and she'd be going shorter, but she can't put it away. She's like a football team that can't get it over the line."

-          I'm a better counter-puncher

-          Have always been very heavily involved in politics

Convention?

-          Need a cheerleader. Something exciting

Debates?

-          I'm ready

-          Drudge said I won all the debates

Part 2

VP qualifications?

-          Have to give same boring answer

-          Need to be able to be a good president

-          Want someone that can help get legislation passed

o   Maybe a Senator

Former GOP rivals on list?

-          When someone says something nasty, never quite like them the same

-          Carson and Christie may be on vetting committee for VP and other positions

Releasing tax returns?

-          Look forward to releasing, but I can't

-          No lawyer would let you release while under domain.com

-          It's unfair that I'm audited every year

-          I'm almost used to it

Women voters?

-          Women want security and strong military

-          Women want womens' health issues taken care of, which HRC won't do

General Election strategy? What states will you put in play?

-          I did really well in New York

-          Manhattan is now under review and they think I won

-          I hear I won every county in Indiana

-          New York is in play in general. Will win upstate and Long Island by massive numbers

Part 1

Learned about Kasich dropping out

-          I always liked John

Did you really think you could win?

-          I guess. Otherwise I wouldn't have done it

-          I gave up a tremendous amount to run

-          Lost certain licenses from controversy

Rigged system. Still think that?

-          Only way I got it was going for the knockout

-          Bernie Sanders' system is also rigged

-          The bosses give out the super delegates

-          GOP system rigged in more sophisticated way

National Enquirer story? You don't really think Rafael Cruz was related to JFK assassination?

-          No I don't. Of course not

-          Was not presumptive nominee at the time

-          His father made horrible statements about me

-          Not saying he did. Just saying it was all over the place

As presumptive nominee, shouldn't standard be higher than conspiracy theories?

-          Wasn't presumptive at the time

HRC says you led birther movement?

-          HRC started the birther movement. Started years before me

-          Under investigation by FBI

-          I do have confidence in James Comey

-          I will raise [birther issue] against her

GQ piece on Melania. Your supporters threatening/attacking the author?

-          I heard it was a nasty article. Haven't read it.

-          "They shouldn't be doing that with wives"

Message to these fans?

-          No message

-          Press is so dishonest

Should U.S. bail out Puerto Rico?

-          No they shouldn't

-          They have too much debt

-          "I love debt"

-          I would buy companies and throw them into bankruptcy

-          Puerto Rico has too much debt. Can't just restructure

-          If they aren't going to pay their bills, they can't pay their bills

-          They will never pay that debt off

Russian jets barrel rolling? What would you tell Putin?

-          I'd call and say "Don't do it again"

-          He called me a genius

-          "I don't want to say" if I've ever met him

-          Lack of respect

You said you want to work with allies in Muslim world?

-          They have to save themselves

How do you do that while having temporary Muslim friends?

-          I have many Muslim friends

-          One just left my office

-          Many Muslims agree with ban

-          Syrian refugee problem

Letting South Korea and Japan develop nukes and defend selves?

-          Many friends in South Korea and Japan

-          They have to help pay us

-          Can't afford that anymore. Have to be prepared to walk

-          "They have to pay... I'm prepared to walk."

Korea pays 50%?

-          Why not 100%

May be more expensive to keep the troops in the U.S. than in Korea?

-          Maybe we don't need them then

-          We're policing all these countries

-          Of course they should pick up all the expense

Sec. Gates questioning your FP understanding?

-          I question his loyalty

-          I understand it much better than he does

-          We're a debtor nation

-          I'll have better relationships than we do now

Minimum wage. You can't live on $7.25?

-          No. I'm looking at that

-          Looking at doing something because "You have to have something you can live on"

-          Bring jobs back so people earn much more

-          Open to raising the minimum wage

-          Sanders supporters will vote for me
