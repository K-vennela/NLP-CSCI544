ally Build a Board Comprised of Better, More Effective Fundraisers

How to domain.com and retain board members who are best suited to help your or=
ganization meet its goals, especially in the area of fundraising.

domain.com leaders understand the importance of the board of directors, espe=
cially their role in raising the financial support needed to implement the =
mission. Who is elected to the board, and the vetting process itself, can h=
ave a huge impact on the effectiveness of the team, the combined resources =
available, and ultimate success of the work at hand. Alternatively, a poorl=
y chosen board can result in wasted time, squandered opportunities and unne=
cessary headaches for the domain.com's in-house leadership.

Because of the board's crucial fundraising role, most nonprofits can benefi=
t by looking beyond nominating committees and rethinking the way they recru=
it board members in order to ensure their team is comprised of the most qua=
lified, connected and effective individuals.=20

Please join Linda Lysakowski, ACFRE, for a session that will help you ident=
ify, cultivate, domain.com and retain board members that are committed to the =
mission of the organization.
