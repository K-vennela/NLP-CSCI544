Dear all,
I’m receiving ongoing pressure from the E. client to resume the relationship that came to an halt after the CitizenLab/HRW reports.I think that we all agree that we should interrupt any business with them due to the recurring media exposure and resulting technical issues. Their reckless and clumsy usage of our solution caused us enough damage. What’s worst is that we can be sure that if we allow them to continue, more will come.
I would like to have your opinion on this and eventually on how to communicate this decision both with the customer and the media, if appropriate. Thanks,Daniele
