Dear Emad

We have some issues with the EU statements and your proposal

1- The proposal in the term and condition said "we accepts to purchase the
solution as above reported for a price of Euro 130.000,00."  the right is we
accepts to purchase on Euro 100.000,00.
2- EU STATEMENT also have amount of  130.000,00. and it should be 100.000,00
3- and what is the order number??

Actually the renewal become annoying.

Dear Said,
Thanks for your e-mail.

Starting from the 1/1/2015, new regulations require to obtain the Export
Authorization before delivery any product/service; that's why we are not
allowed to send our engineer without the authorization. The EU Statement
signed and stamp is the document needed to require the authorization..

During my last domain.com, I promised to come and take it by hand since you
showed me your fear that your identities can be discover based on the last
leakage of FF, but unlikely I was not aware of the rules modifications.

Keeping in consideration your concerns and in order to speed up the process,
I'm available to come to Oman one day next week (Thursday 22nd), take the
docs by hands and arrange the system upgrade.

Please let me know if this date is suitable for you.

Hoping you can appreciate my effort

Best regards

Dear Emad

Again this is not what you said last time, you promise us to come and update
the system and take the EU statement with you. In all cases, I can not send
you the document by fax or by any media. Must be delivered by hand.
To be clear i believe we have the right to upgrade because it coverd by to
the previous year contract, and you insist to have the EU statement (which
is for the new contract) before any upgrade (Due from last year).

finally, we are ready to sign the contract , and ready to upgrade. and ready
to supply you with EU statement.

Best Regards
Said alwahaibi

Dear Said,
thanks for your e-mail.

As anticipate in our last meeting, due to the New European Export
Regulations with effect from 01 January 2015, we need to have the EU
Statement stamp and signed by the government agency that uses our solution
before sending any software or perform any activity.

For this reason we need to received the EU Statement and our Commercial
Proposal duly sign and stamp, because without those documents we are not
authorize to send any technician.
In order to avoid any risk, we would suggest you to send those documents by
Fax or through an encrypted channel ( i.e. skype).

Looking forward to hear from you.

Dear Emad

I will not get into an argument ...

and we agreed on previous  email for the domain.com of the Thch. on 27th - 28th
and please don't link the upgrade domain.com with the renewal contract because
the upgrade is our rights because of last year contract.

Generally Please send us your invoice and payment procedures and we will
sign the contract and deliver it to the Technical person hand by hand.

Dear Said,
thanks for your e-mail.

Please don't take our communication as a restricted agreement, it's not our
way of working.
Once we spoke about the extension of 3 months we were suppose to have the
discount of 10%. Since we notice that for you it will be better to have a
higher discount, around 25%, we are not in position to gave to you other
extensions. We gave to you N°2 Option that allow you to decide which one it
will be better works with you.
We tried to have a look on your request to have as well the 3 moths
extension, but regrettably it's not feasible.

Hope that you can understand our position. My domain.com to you was to increase
our relationship and gave to you the much support as we can. Also kindly
note that we need to have the End User Statement stamp and signed from your
part, and as per your request, it will be available and gave to us only by
hand.

Having said that if you decide to have only the Tech. person for the update
and not speak about the NIA and not meet me as well, we accept it.
Please kindly note that we can confirm the domain.com after having the Contract
signed and payment from your part.

We are confident that you can recognize our effort and we remain at your
completely disposal.

Dear Emad

It is noticeable that you do not want to talk about your promise to extend
the contract until the month of March 2015 at a price of 100,000.

Here's  following:
1. We agree on the price of 100,000 start from January 2015 to the end of
December 2015.
2. your domain.com have been canceled.
3. kindly send the technician to update the system (only the technician) at
the same agreed date.
4. we will not discuss any further subject during the technician domain.com.
