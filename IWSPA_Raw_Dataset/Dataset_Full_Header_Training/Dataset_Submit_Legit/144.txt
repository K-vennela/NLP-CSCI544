Hey Jonae! A few questions for you.

-Who is advising the ASDC meeting? Is it our press team? Is there a credential process?
-User will likely be attending. What time should he arrive and when would be a good time to leave?
-Do you need any other press staffers there to do press-check in, in addition to User?

Rachel
