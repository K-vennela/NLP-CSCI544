Yo!

Can you please make sure we have 1 or 2 high tops for a signing table? Have a few things we need to bang out. And I asked the Organizationto give all their photos or notes to me directly (will knock out on foreign trip).

Also - can you stick two chairs in the corner directly across from the door POTUS walks in on for me and Caitria?

Thanks!
Bobby
