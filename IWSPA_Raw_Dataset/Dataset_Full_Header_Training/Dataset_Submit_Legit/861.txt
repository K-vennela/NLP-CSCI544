NYT is out with a story. We expect to see a letter from the State Party shortly that is submitted to the Chairs of the Rules & Bylaws committee, but that doesn't ask anything of the DNC, just to register their concerns about the behavior coming from some of the supporters, including death threats. Will circulate as soon as we have it.
