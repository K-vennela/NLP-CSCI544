SL: Trump Spits on Special Relationship with United Kingdom

"Even as a candidate, Donald Trump is already jeopardizing relationships with our allies - this time by shamefully deriding our friends in the United Kingdom. Trump's idea of diplomacy is reckless, juvenile name-calling that only serves to isolate us from our allies and diminish America's standing on the world stage. Of course, his dangerous foreign policy stances already include dismissing the importance of NATO and refusing to rule out using nuclear weapons on European soil. Today's comments are simply the latest reminder that Trump does not have the temperament or judgment to be president." - OrganizationNational Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach

Donald Trump has once again shown that he does not have the temperament or judgment to be President. This morning<<<link>>>, in response to concerns raised by British Prime Minister David Cameron on Trump's divisive and dangerous policy to ban Muslims from entering the United States, Trump said "it looks like we're not going to have a very good relationship". He also responded to similar concerns raised by London's new mayor, saying<<<link>>> "I don't care about him" and "I will remember those statements, they're very nasty statements". He also challenged<<<link>>> the mayor to an IQ contest. It's no wonder Britain's parliament has already debated<<<link>>> whether to ban Trump from their country.

These latest comments come after Trump questioned<<<link>>> the usefulness of NATO. He also refused<<<link>>> to rule out using nuclear weapons on European territory, and wants<<<link>>> to allow countries that don't currently have nuclear weapons to get them, reversing long-held goals of international nuclear disarmament. Trump also falsely claimed that he knows<<<link>>> "more about ISIS than the generals" and recommended<<<link>>> that the U.S. military domain.com international war crimes.
