By the way, Jonathan, off the record, are you talking to anyone who could b=
alance out Nina's perspective? How about Steny Hoyer? I'm sure someone like=
 Steny could give you a very different perspective.

Hi Jonathan. On background, the Organizationis neutral in the primary.

Also ON BACKGROUND, here are facts to consider:

The OrganizationChair has repeatedly said on the air and otherwise that it=92s not =
her job to tell either candidate to get out and has never called for anyone=
 to get out of the race. She has talked in very positive terms<<<link>>
domain.com/Post/dnc-chair-statement-on-april-26-primary-results> about b=
oth of our candidates<<<link>>
-south-carolina-primary-results-feb-27> and the substantive campaigns they=
=92ve run<<<link>>
re-primary-results>. As for the debates, the fact is our debates earned far=
 better ratings<<<link>>
nk-far-ahead-of-most-primary-debates-889d8ab42ca#.qepssg11f> overall this y=
ear than they did in past cycles. And when we were able to get both campaig=
ns to agree, we added four.

The rules in place for this election have been pretty much the same for sev=
eral cycles. In fact, the major change from 2015 =96 when Obama beat Clinto=
n --- is that there are actually LESS unpledged =93super=94 delegates, now =
down to 15% from 20% prior to the change. No one wrote or rewrote any rules=
 to help or hurt any specific candidate, these are the Party rules.

The single biggest factor determining the nominee (85%) is the participatio=
n of voters in primaries and caucuses. You can see a post we did here that =
lays out the facts on Super Delegates<<<link>>
e-are-the-actual-facts-about-super-delegates-7660c5c7dd1#.288n079v7>. It al=
so debunks the false myths about Iowa.

The DNC=92s delegate selection rules for this primary were set before any o=
f these candidates declared, and are consistent with the rules in place for=
 several cycles =96 including 2015 when Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clint=
on.

OFF THE RECORD, There=92s just no evidence that the process has been rigged=
. It certainly wasn=92t rigged in Nevada last weekend -- which was not a DN=
C event but a state party one. But don=92t take it from us, here=92s what J=
