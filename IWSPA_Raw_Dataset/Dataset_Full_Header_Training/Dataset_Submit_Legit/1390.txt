Donald Trump's recklessness would diminish our standing in the world and make our nation less safe. Trump is divisive and dangerous, and he lacks the temperament to be president.

But Donald Trump is no accident-his harmful foreign policy rhetoric comes straight from the out-of-touch GOP playbook. This morning on MSNBC, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a Republican who has served presidents of both parties, questioned Donald Trump's temperament, and highlighted that Republicans have only offered "uninformed bluster and threats" when it comes to our national security.

Gates also expressed concern that Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric has already harmed our relationships with our allies around the world:

"I think [people overseas] are especially apprehensive about the unpredictability and the threats of Mr. Trump and some of the things he's said, from having Japan and South Korea have nuclear weapons to breaking off the relationship with China. . . these are all of serious concern. And the problem, the worry is that even before the election, countries begin to take steps to offset these dangers or these perceived shifts in U.S. policy in ways that put greater distance between ourselves and them in terms of cooperation in the future."

Even as a candidate, Trump has damaged America's relationships across the globe. In the White House, he would undeniably make our nation less safe. We can't afford to have Donald Trump as Commander in Chief.
