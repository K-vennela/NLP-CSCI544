Smoke and Mirrors

The Republican Establishment is struggling to come to terms with Donald Trump as their standard-bearer, claiming that he doesn't truly represent their values. But from the Donald's opposition to raising the minimum wage to his tax cut plan, Trump has been the answer to House Speaker Paul Ryan's prayers.

Trump's populist appeal masks his shallow understanding of how the economy actually works, despite his insistence that he can "make America great again." Claiming the U.S. can never default on its debt because we can always print more money or that he can negotiate partial debt payments with foreign creditors is as reckless as it is inaccurate.

In Trump's world, that's business as usual. Trump's businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt, leaving investors, contractors and small businesses on the hook for his bad business decisions.

Let's not fool ourselves. The only deal to be had with Donald Trump is a bad one. Making America great doesn't require smoke and mirrors.
