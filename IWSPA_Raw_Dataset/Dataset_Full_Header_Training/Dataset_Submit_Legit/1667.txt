Sen. Pat Toomey says he voted for Ted Cruz<<<link>>>

By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL

Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey voted for Ted Cruz on Tuesday.

"He's a solid conservative," Toomey, who had previously endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, told reporters outside of a polling place in Zionsville, according to The Morning Call. "We don't agree on everything, but having served with him in the Senate, I know Ted pretty well and I think he's got a real, real viable shot of beating Hillary Clinton in the fall."

Four Democrats in the state are competing for Toomey's Senate seat. Cruz told the "Chris Stigall Show" that the Pennsylvania lawmaker will retain his seat if Cruz is at the top of the ticket. But Trump, he argued, puts every Republican running in a blue or purple state "in grave jeopardy."

"If I'm the nominee, Pat Toomey gets reelected," Cruz said. "If Donald Trump is the nominee, the Senate is gone and there's nothing you can do about it."
Trump holds a 22-point advantage over his rivals in Pennsylvania, according to a RealClearPolitics average of state polls, and is expected to sweep the five states that vote Tuesday.
