Huckabee Sanders on CNN

-          Trump hesitant to release because of poor "IRS track record on dealing with conservatives"

-          Americans not concerned about Trump's tax returns, more concerned with knowing Trump's tax policy

-          Financial disclosure more thorough anyway

OK if HRC didn't release her returns?

-          She has far bigger things to be concerned about

"Trump is committed to releasing those returns the minute the domain.com is complete"
