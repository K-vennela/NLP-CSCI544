OrganizationChair Statement on Tonight=92s Primary Results

WASHINGTON - Tonight, voters went to the polls in five states. In Pennsylva=
nia, domain.com polling showed that 71 percent of Democratic voters felt their pr=
imary had energized the party while 58 percent of Republican voters said th=
eir primary had divided the party =96 nearly the same in both cases as what=
 New Yorkers reported last week. OrganizationChair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued =
the following statement on tonight=92s results:

=93Ranting and raving his way to five primary victories tonight, Donald Tru=
mp has secured his chokehold on the Republican nomination. For years, GOP l=
eaders have pushed a cynical and feckless political strategy that exploits =
unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and=
 more, all for political gain. They have sold hardworking Americans the emp=
ty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while strangling America=92s middle =
class with backwards economic policies that only enrich those already at th=
e top. Donald Trump=92s impending nomination is the ultimate, sad culminati=
on of the success of that strategy. Trump is
the modern Republican Party.

=93It=92s no surprise that at domain.com polls in contest after contest, more and=
 more Democratic voters are reporting that our primary process has energize=
d our party, while more and more Republicans report deep, dispiriting divis=
ions in theirs.

=93I want to congratulate Secretary Clinton on her victories tonight, and b=
oth of our candidates for continuing to run spirited, substantive campaigns=
 worthy of the American people. It=92s clear that when we get through our c=
onventions, Democrats will emerge united having nominated the next presiden=
t, while the GOP will have to wallow in the chaotic mess of their own makin=
