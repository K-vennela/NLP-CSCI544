Just one additional tweak to try to make it more clear that the "many milli=

Perfect. Here it is revised with Graham and Brad's feedback. Any further ed=

ised, but of that, many millions HAVE BEEN RAISED FOR STATE PARTIES AND JUS=
T HASN'T BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO THEM YET (NOR HAS IT GONE TO THE OrganizationOR ANYWHE=

Just a few thoughts here:

-       I think that is really worthwhile to continue to push back on the P=
olitico story's numbers being wrong. In the sub-headline that say that stat=
e parties only get to keep 1 percent of all the money being raised, but tha=
t is really incorrect and comparing apples and oranges. They reference the =
total amount of money that has been raised, but of that, many millions have=
n't yet been moved from HVF to state parties, but it also hasn't gone to th=
e Organizationor anywhere else. Because this is money for the general election, and=
 coordinated campaigns are just now starting to be built at state parties, =
it is perfectly understandable that not all of the HVF money owed to state =
parties would have been distributed yet.

-       I would lean so heavily on Hasen specifically in our on the record =
quote, as he could always come out and say something different. I think it =
is worth keeping that in the background materials, but given that others, w=
hen asked, also said there wasn't really anything to this, maybe we just ke=
ep the on the record quote more general? Something like The suggestion ther=
e's anything unusual about our joint victory funds has no basis in the law =
or reality, as recognized by numerous independent experts that have looked =
at this.

Here's a draft quote and background points to use in pushing back on the Sa=
