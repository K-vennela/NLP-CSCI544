Nice to hear from you. Last August before I went on maternity leave when I =
did the story. Wasn't going to bring up your name today but Josh was trying=
 to get me to be more forthcoming about what I was getting at and I underst=
ood why he was doing that and thought o would just be forthcoming.
 But I do have questions about your role in the Trimpa Group's lobbying on =
the Cuba issue. I contacted the Trimpa Group several times to try to reach =
you -- didn't know you had moved on to the Organizationuntil yesterday.
