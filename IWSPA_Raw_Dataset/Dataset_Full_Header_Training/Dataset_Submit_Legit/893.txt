Missed the beginning.

SESSIONS: Henry Kissinger is a fabulous thinker. Read his book. Kudlow and Miller working on econ plan.

CAVUTO: U.S. Trade Assns. Prefer HRC 50% to 25%?

SESSIONS: Most biz have gotten accustomed to the status quo. People will come around to this pro-growth plan.

CAVUTO: Back to SCOTUS list, what about Willet's zingers at Trump?

SESSIONS: We want justices that follow the constitution. Real question is if he's committed, a good scholar, good integrity

CAVUTO: Has DJT said what his litmus test would be for SCOTUS nominees?

SESSIONS: What he shared with me is that he likes a Scalia, Thomas-like judge. Like Roberts says, calls balls and strikes. Has ability to follow complex rules of law.

CAVUTO: Your favorite?

SESSIONS: Bill Pryor. I chose him to nominate to AL court.

CAVUTO: You were one of first to endorse DJT. Some are looking for a 3rd party run? What do you think of him trying to win them over with this?

SESSIONS: I think he will win them over with this. Important for establishment to know that someone will run this gov't efficiently.  Lots of things can be done that will help growth. Median income is down. You can tell many people are unhappy.
