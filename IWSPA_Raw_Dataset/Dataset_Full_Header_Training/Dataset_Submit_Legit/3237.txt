*         I feel good tomorrow if turnout is high, message is resonating

*         disputes that HRC has 2.7 million more votes because he doesn't think all caucus states have been counted

*         do you believe person who has most votes/delegates will be nominee?

o   I believe that this campaign is about the message

o   if we're behind in pledged delegates, it's very hard for us

o   we're the stronger campaign in taking on Trump or any republican, and Democrats care about that more than anything

o   superdelegates voted for HRC before I even announced, those people have a right to rethink decision that they made

*         how hard will you press that case?

o   issue is 5 states tomorrow, 10 states including largest in country

o   going to talk about middle class decline etc

*         you got hit for saying poor people don't vote

o   Clinton campaign has a Super PAC, 30 people on the domain.com making a big deal of everything I saw

o   low income people not voting in large numbers, I want that to change

*         what have you succeeded / failed at in turning out voters who don't vote

o   it's very difficult

o   so many middle class people turn on the TV, see nothing being talked about that improves their life, see Congress talking about tax breaks for billionaires, candidates taking millions from special interests

*         John Fetterman in PA endorsed you, has similar ideas, you haven't endorsed him or anything

o   I don't know much about him, etc

*         you built this movement, raised more than anyone

o   HRC has raised more, we don't have a Super Pac

*         campaigns like yours have faded away in the past, what would you do after?

o   it'll be a lot easier to mobilize / endure if I'm elected president

*         will you encourage your supporters to vote for HRC if you don't win nomination?

o   we're not a movement where I can snap my fingers and tell you what to do, you make your decisions yourself

o   if we lose and HRC wins, it's incumbent upon her to tell people who have serious misgivings about her Wall St $, etc, that she thinks the US should take on private insurance companies and pass Medicare for all, tuition free public colleges, she's going to have to explain to millions of young people that climate change is not going to be solved by incrementalism, pass a carbon tax.

o   incumbent upon HRC to present an agenda for working class, not just wealthy

*         Tim Robbins, Rosario Dawson have said things-what role do *you* have if HRC in nominee

o   good question, I work with GOP in Senate, have seen what they do in the House

o   GOP has moved so far to the right, unrecognizable, don't believe in climate change, want to end ACA

o   I will do everything in my power to make sure no Republican gets into the WH

*         how will you make sure you can implement CIR where undocumented immigrants like my parents aren't treated as second-class citizens

o   many are exploited now, by employers, living in shadows, I believe we need CIR

o   I will use exec powers if Congress don't act to make your parents safe

o   I disagree with Obama, will end deportations

*         how will you actually work with Congress

o   actually passed more amendments with Republicans than anyone else

o   passed comprehensive vets legislation with bipartisan support

*         OFA didn't do a whole lot, what could you do?

o   I talked to Obama about this, it is tough

o   President can help bring ordinary people together in grassroots, pressure Congress

o   because Obama is such a decent guy, he actually believed he could negotiate in good faith with Republicans-he was wrong, they never had any intention of doing so, it took Obama years to learn that. he knows it now. I will know that when I get there

*         soda tax opposition, we have a lot of constraints, so what would you do to fund pre-school?

o   I believe absolutely, priority is to establish high quality pre-K in every state

o   at time of massive income inequality, soda tax hurts the poor the most

o   it has to be funded in a progressive way

*         collateral consequences to incarceration

o   we should be embarrassed by how many people we have in jail

o   [mass incarceration platform]

*         voting for crime bill mistake?

o   this question has been asked literally a million times

o   it had bad provisions, it also had VAWA, ban on assault weapons

*         worst vote?

o   I shouldn't have voted to deregulate derivatives

o   HRC supported DOMA

*         under current law can US strike ISIS anywhere in the world?

o   no, I am confident we'll get new AUMF

o   I will not get us involved in perpetual warfare in Middle East

*         would you keep kill list as President?

o   we have right to defend ourselves, has to be done constitutionally

*         is what is being done now constitutional?

o   in general, yes

*         are 250 special operators to Syria permissible?

o   yes, bottom line is ISIS must be destroyed, not through American troops on ground

*         how will you fight for abortion access in every state?

o   totally support women's right to choose, expand planned parenthood

o   republicans totally hypocritical

*         SCOTUS TX law would gut Roe, how big a deal?

o   of course it's a big deal, why it goes without saying I'll nominee people to SCOTUS who will overturn CU and support Roe

*         HRC ticket / administration, or her on your ticket?

o   let me answer that exactly as you knew I would

o   we'll take a look at the end of the process
