This is really great. As she mentions, Trump has cited her several times as=
 proof that he's not sexist. She says that he is...

Trump Touted The Fact That He Put A Woman In Charge Of Construction Of Trum=
p Tower As Proof That He Believed In Gender Equality. =93The 68-story Trump=
 Tower, on Fifth Avenue right next to Tiffany=92s, was the tallest entirely=
 glass-exteriored building in Manhattan when it opened in 1983. That helped=
 pioneer the modern luxury-building industry. One of the things I=92m most =
proud of about that building is that the person I put in charge of overseei=
ng construction was a 33-year-old woman. I made that decision in 1983, when=
 the fight for gender equality in business was really beginning. None of th=
e people who whine about the way I talk to women mention the fact that I vo=
luntarily promoted gender equality in a male-dominated industry.=94 [Donald=

Trump hired me as a powerful woman. I saw how sexism became his trademark<h=

s-woman-card>
Barbara Res<<<link>>>

In a victory speech on Tuesday, Donald Trump told<<<link>>
m/us-news/2016/apr/27/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-primaries-results-genera=
l-election-sanders-delegates> a crowd of adoring supporters that Hillary Cl=
inton was playing =93the woman card=94. He alleged that Clinton wouldn=92t =
get many votes if she were a man: =93I don=92t think she=92d get 5% of the =
vote,=94 he said. Trump, of course, claims to be =93great for women=94. He =
has said this many times =96 and he mentions me as direct proof.

In the 1980s, Donald Trump<<<link>>> =
hired me to be vice-president of his company, in charge of the Trump Tower =
construction. I certainly benefited from being given the position, which wa=
s a daring move back then. There were no women in construction in those day=
s. At the time, I applauded him for being forward-thinking.

But his rationale in hiring me was colored by his general opinion of the se=
xes. He said that men, in general, are better than women, but =93a good wom=
an is better than 10 good men=94. He based this on the fact that women had =
to be smarter, try harder and work harder just to compete in a man=92s worl=
d. I had proven to him that I had the markings of =93a killer=94, just the =
type to represent him on the construction site. I wonder if Trump still req=
uires his female executives to be killers.

Trump has said some very sexist things in print and on camera about women. =
Does this reflect the real Donald Trump or, as he puts it, just entertainme=
nt? He chose to appear on the cover of Playboy magazine with a naked woman.=
 He chose to be interviewed by Howard Stern where he discussed and rated wo=
men=92s physical attributes. Trump used the print media to describe how he =
thought women wanted and expected to be treated poorly. How can he distance=
 himself from his own words and acts?

The Trump I started working with in 1978 was very different from who he is =
today. He used to be deferential to women. He had tremendous respect for hi=
s mother and I think this influenced his treatment of women. He did not tal=
k about them disparagingly. He did not discriminate against women in hiring=
.

When he put Ivana in charge of the Plaza Hotel, he said he would pay her in=
 dresses, a remark that devalued her contribution and hurt her badly. When =
his breakup happened, he bragged about being with so many women, it distrac=
ted him from his work. He boasted about newspaper headlines detailing his s=
ex life. I heard him talk, for the first time, about women=92s bodies. Thos=
e sexist comments attributed to him recently come as no surprise. Neither d=
o his remarks about Hillary Clinton.When I worked there, Trump had several =
extremely strong, outspoken women whom he listened to. Even his wife, Ivana=
, was put in a position of great power and trust. But over the years, I saw=
 him change. As Trump became more famous, his behavior towards women worsen=
ed. He started talking about movie stars who wanted to date him, even while=
 he was still married.

Trump=92s positions on the issues are anti-women on their face. He is oppos=
ed to reproductive freedom. This is a fundamental right and important to mo=
st women in the electorate. He is opposed to the Affordable Care Act, which=
 has empowered women. He is opposed to raising the minimum wage, which affe=
cts women more than men. He is in favor of deporting undocumented migrants =
who have raised families in the United States. A domain.com full of women woul=
d not mitigate the impact of his stance on these matters.

Trump would be well served to listen to his advisers with regard to his tre=
atment of Clinton and women=92s issues. But he continues to show that he is=
 not being =93handled=94, and it=92s likely he will go on with this bluster=
 and braggadocio. Trump has threatened to go after Clinton and no doubt, he=
 will do it in a way that reeks of sexism. Trump probably thinks his commen=
ts about women and treatment of Hillary will win him more of the men=92s vo=
te. He will need as many as he can get if that=92s true, because he won=92t=
 be getting many from women.
