*         are you presumptive nominee?

o   no, I'm on the path, and I'm very far ahead in popular vote / delegate count

o   I think the path leads to nomination

*         Sanders not necessarily running to win anymore, but to advance progressive causes, $15 federal min wage, trade policy, breaking up banks, passing carbon tax, could you make a deal with him on platform?

o   I look forward to working with Sanders on platform, it will be progressive, I've run on progressive agenda

o   I was pleased Sanders said he'd work to make sure Trump is not president, I welcomed that

*         any specific issues you think you could work with him on, ruled out Medicare for all?

o   we're going to talk, we have the same goals-min wage, universal healthcare, climate change

o   we have so much more in common

*         will it hurt you if Sanders withholds support until convention?

o   no reason to believe that, I immediately endorsed Obama when I dropped out, began working for him

o   we talked about platform/convention, he asked me to nominate him

*         take us back to 2008, what do you think Sanders is going through?

o   it's hard, you throw yourself in body and soul, everybody is so invested in trying to win

o   I absolutely understand, Sanders has been a passionate advocate, that's been helpful to Dem primary process

o   there comes a time when you have to look at reality-I was much closer to Obama in 08 than is the case right now

*         Trump says he'll go after Sanders supporters, they're independents, similar trade / money in politics views, how to counter that?

o   we'll be outreaching to Sanders supporters as well

o   if you don't believe in climate change, min wage, how do you get people who are passionate about it?

o   insulting to women, dangerous view of FP

o   I'm going to be very aggressive in reaching out to Sanders supporters, far more in common than they do with Trump/any Republican

o   I said before Sanders got into campaign that we have to reverse CU

*         thoughts on Trump FP address?

o   read about it, quite concerning, pulling out of NATO, letting other countries get nuclear weapons

o   secret plan to fight ISIS

o   turning our back on our strongest allies not smart way to lead world

*         Trump might run to your left on military intervention, your response on Libya / Iraq?

o   I'm always someone who uses military force as a last resort, it's not a first choice

o   I put together coalition to oppose Iran sanctions

o   I think we'll have a lot to contrast with

*         says if you were a man you're be way behind

o   I don't respond to his attacks on me

o   I have more than 2 million votes more than Trump

o   there are women out there really struggling

*         have you learned anything from watching GOP deal with Trump in primaries?

o   remember, I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave, won't deal with their temper tantrums

o   he can say whatever he wants to about me

o   I've been specific with my plans, he hasn't, won't or can't

*         Trump will try to win Ohio/PA/MI, focus on trade?

o   I won Ohio and PA with more votes than Trump, I feel good.

o   I've been clear on trade

o   I have a track record of standing up to China

o   we don't do enough to help people in this country who have been hurt by trade deals

o   you can't take an absolutist position for or against trade

*         is Trump qualified?

o   voters will have to determine that

*         did you ever see this happening when you attended Trump and Melania's wedding?

o   I didn't even think I would run for president

o   never crossed my mind
