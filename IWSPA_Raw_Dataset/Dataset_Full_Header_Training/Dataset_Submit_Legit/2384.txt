Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump<<<link>>

=93It is influencing our children and their behavior in schools, and making=

Randi Weingarten: Donald Trump's Rhetoric Has Contaminated Schools
By Andrew Ujifusa<<<link>>> on May 5, 2015 3:53 PM
<<link>>
d_trump_education_damage.html

Forget Donald Trump's plans to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education o=
r allegations of fraud against Trump University: The real estate executive =
has already poisoned public schools, according to American Federation of Te=
achers President Randi Weingarten, by fostering a toxic environment that en=
courages bullying.

In a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Weingarten blasted the rea=
l estate executive for his "xenophobia" and his "promotion of violence." An=
d she said that it's too late to turn back the clock on the negative effect=
 he's already had on public schools.

"My point is, he's already done tremendous damage to education," Weingarten=
 said during a conference call with reporters. "He's created an environment=
 of scapegoating and demonizing. It is influencing children and it is influ=
encing behavior in schools. It is making it much, much harder for us." [ele=
ctionslug_2016_126x126.jpg] <<<link>>>

Is there anything to back up Weingarten's assertion? Last month, my colleag=
ue Evie Blad covered a survey conducted by the Southern Poverty Law Center =
showing that most teachers say their students=97many of them Muslim or the =
children of immigrants=97have expressed fears about their fate after the el=
ection<<<link>>
mps_rhetoric_has_made_some_students_feel_unsafe_report_says.html>. And 40 p=
ercent said they're afraid to teacher their students about the election. Ho=
wever, that survey was not scientific.

There have also been reports of incidents like Donald Trump's name being ch=
anted by fans<<<link>>

racial slurs. (Trump has pledged to halt illegal immigration from Mexico by=
 building a wall along the southern border, and by making the Mexican gover=
nment pay for it.) But in general, it's hard to statiscally identify exactl=
y how Trump has or has not broadly influenced the climate of public schools=
.

Make no mistake, Weingarten and Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan, who was also on=
 the call, blasted Trump for his other positions on education too. Weingart=
en said she was not surprised that one of Trump's high-profile surrogates i=
s New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who has said teachers' union=
s need a punch in the face<<<link>>
5/08/gov_christie_teachers_unions_need_a_punch_in_the_face_and_are_destruct=
ive.html>.

"What we're seeing is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party be an=
ti-teacher and anti-public education," the AFT president said.

Donald Trump hasn't taken many in-depth positions on K-12 during the campai=
gn. But he has taken a few (relatively) clear positions on K-12<<<link>>
domain.com/edweek/campaign-k-12/2016/05/donald_trump_education_policy_rev=
iew.html>. He wants to eliminate the Common Core State Standards=97somethin=
g the federal government cannot do. And as Weingarten noted, he's said he w=
ants to either severely cut or eliminate the Education Department=97at the =
same time, he declared in March that education is one of the top three prio=
rities for the federal government<<<link>>
-12/2016/03/donald_trump_education_federal_priority.html>.

You might remember that both the AFT and the National Education Association=
 moved pretty quickly to endorse former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton =
for the Democratic presidential nomination. That did not sit well with some=
 members of the two unions, who thought that there ought to have been more =
consideration of Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.<<<link>>
.domain.com/ew/articles/2016/03/30/sanders-gets-educators-attention-despite=
-few-specifics.html> So it's not surprising that Weingarten in particular w=
ould come up swinging against Trump quickly and vigorously, now that he's t=
he presumptive nominee.
