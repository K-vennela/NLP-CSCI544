SL: domain.com Polls Continue to Show Democratic Unity

domain.com polls<<<link>>> from last week's New York primary offered a look into how Democrats are coming together as we head into the general election. Seven in ten New York Democrats say they are energized by the primary process.

This enthusiasm is not only found in New York. Take a look at domain.com polls from today's contests...

These numbers are further evidence that Republicans are being torn apart by divisive candidates and an ugly primary process. Democratic voters are proud of their candidates, and it shows every time they go to the polls across the country. Whether they vote for Senator Sanders or Secretary Clinton, Democrats are expressing their support for a candidate they respect and admire, and will come together whomever is the nominee in November.
