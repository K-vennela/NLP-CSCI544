Highlights of Donald Trump=92s Interview on Taxes, Debt and the Fed<<<link>>
domain.com/economics/2016/05/10/highlights-of-donald-trumps-interview-on=
-taxes-debt-and-the-fed/>

Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was intervie=
wed by The Wall Street Journal on Monday. Mr. Trump discussed his views on =
fiscal and monetary policy and attempted to quiet jitters over remarks he=
=92s made in recent days suggesting he would renegotiate U.S. debt in an ec=
onomic downturn and saying rich people might pay higher taxes. Here are hig=
hlights, lightly edited for clarity and length.

ON MR. TRUMP=92S TAX PROPOSAL

The Wall Street Journal:  And are you going to be changing your proposal?  =
I=92ve heard some talk that you might alter some of the =97 they key featur=
es of it.

Donald Trump:  Always possible to change.  I always believe in flexibility =
and remaining flexible.  It=92s going to change anyway because when you sta=
rt negotiating the plan, you know =97 although [President Barack] Obama wou=
ld use executive orders, right?  But when you start negotiating the plan, t=
here=92s always going to be give and take, but this is the proposal and it=
=92s been very well received.

WSJ: How should the public and the voters know what your core beliefs on ta=
xes are?

Mr. Trump:  Well, my core beliefs are I want a major tax cut, and I=92m onl=
y being honest with people.  You can=92t just say, =93This is what my plan =
will be,=94 and you know, you have to get =97 you have to negotiate this wi=
th many other people and those many other people are congressmen and senato=
rs, etc., and you know, everybody knows that you have to do that.  So =97 b=
ut I put in a proposal that=92s the biggest tax cut of anybody by far and =
=97 but I also know there will be give and take, because it=92s something t=
hat has to be (inaudible) negotiated.

WSJ:  What makes you think that Democrats will be willing to negotiate on t=
his when they say taxes should go up on high income people not =97 up not d=
own, just less than you want them to go down?

Mr. Trump:  Well, they may go up on high-income people, based on my proposa=
l.  In other words, at the proposal level, not at the =97 where they are no=
w level.

WSJ:  Right, but Democrats want to start with today and raise taxes from th=
at.  What makes you think that they=92ll say=85

Mr. Trump:  Well, it=92s =97 like I said there, it will be give and take an=
d they=92re going to want other things having nothing to do with this.  And=
 they=92re going to want things having absolutely nothing to do with this b=
ut that they=92ll consider important.So, it=92s all very =97 it=92s one ver=
y big, very complex proposal into a negotiation.

ON TAX BREAKS

WSJ: What tax breaks on high-income people should go away?

Mr. Trump:  Well, we=92re getting carried interest taken out.  I=92m taking=
 the carried interest out.

WSJ:  Right, but those people would still be able to reduce =97 I mean, the=
y=92re paying 23.8% now and they=92d pay 15% in the=85

Mr. Trump:  It would be carried interest.

WSJ:  Right, but they=92d pay 15% because they=92d be business income.

Mr. Trump:  You=92re right.  Depending on what the final deal is. But what =
I=92m going to do and what my priority is going to be is business and middl=
e income.

ON U.S. TAX RATES

Mr. Trump:  No. 1, you =97 you do have to reduce taxes and =97 you know, ag=
ain, we=92re the highest in the world =97 highest taxes in the world.

WSJ:  Well, we=92re highest tax in the corporate rate, but I mean, overall,=
 taxes are=85

Mr. Trump:  But =97 well, I=92m saying corporate rate, we=92re the highest.=
  And =97 and if you look =97 and the other thing that has to be done is si=
mplification.  You look at tax returns today and =97 and you know, you have=
 to be =97 you have to be No. 1 in your class at the Wharton School of Fina=
nce [at the University of Pennsylvania] to understand what=92s going on.  H=
onestly, it=92s =97 it=92s a ridiculous situation with the complexity and w=
hat they=92ve allowed to happen.

WSJ: And so in that negotiation [on taxes], what=92s your red line? What ar=
e the things that you couldn=92t give up on?

Mr. Trump: I never talked about a red line. I never talked about a red line=
. You don=92t know. You may give up on certain things that you wouldn=92t t=
hink of now, but you=92ll get something in other negotiation having to do w=
ith another subject. So you really can=92t talk about a red line. You don=
=92t know what that might be.

ON U.S. DEBT

Mr. Trump:  I=92m only saying you can buy back. Look, this isn=92t a real e=
state deal where you can go in and buy out a mortgage at a big discount bec=
ause the market crashes, OK?  This is the United States government.  The bo=
nds are absolutely sacred.  But when you can do, and all I said, is that yo=
u can =97 I=92m surprised this has been getting =97 has this been getting a=
 lot of publicity?  I haven=92t=85

WSJ:  Yes, in the financial press, sure.

Mr. Trump:  Oh really?  I=92m surprised because I think it was clear.  I=92=
m saying if interest rates go up, you can buy debt at a discount on the mar=
ket =97 just on the market.  You just buy back debt on =97 at a discount.

WSJ:  And so the U.S. government should spend its money to go buy back its =
bonds and=85

Mr. Trump:  Well, if they can make good deals.  If they can buy the =97 if =
they can buy the debt back at good deals, you could buy it back in the mark=
et. And if rates go up, you=92ll always =97 you=92re always given that oppo=
rtunity.  But no, I=92m not talking about negotiating with =97 with people =
that own the debt or creditors or anything like that.

ON FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRWOMAN JANET YELLEN AND INTEREST RATES

WSJ:  And you=92ve talked about replacing Yellen.  Who =97 what kind of per=
son would you replace her with?

Mr. Trump:  Well, I am a low-interest rate person.  But, obviously, if infl=
ation rears its ugly head, you can no longer =97 you know, you have to do s=
omething about that.  And, one of the things you=92re doing about that is r=
aising interest rates is slowing things down.

But, I am a low-interest rate person generally speaking.  But I would repla=
ce =97 I mean, look, she=92s got a term to go.

WSJ:  Mm-hmm.

Mr. Trump: I have great respect for her.  I don=92t know her but I have gre=
at respect for her.  But I would imagine that we would put a Republican in =
that position. But I=92m somebody that =97 while we can do it, as an domain.com=
e right now, if interest rates went up, our economy is not doing well at al=
l.

And it=92s going to hurt the economy very badly.  If interest rates went up=
, it would be a disaster.  If the value of the dollar goes up, it would be,=
 at this point, not a very good thing.

ON HIS POLICY ADVISORS

WSJ:  And do you know =96 besides [Larry] Kudlow, who else is advising you =
on taxes?

Mr. Trump:  We=92ve got new =97 sorry, really good people.  I have good law=
 firms representing me and very good people.

WSJ:  Great.  Thanks so much.  Anything you want to add?

Mr. Trump:  Thank you very much.  No.  Just =97 I would like you to straigh=
ten it out because somebody said they didn=92t understand the debt portion =
of it. Obviously you=92re not going to have talks with creditors.  So, it=
=92s good if you, you know, I=92m glad you called about that.  OK?
