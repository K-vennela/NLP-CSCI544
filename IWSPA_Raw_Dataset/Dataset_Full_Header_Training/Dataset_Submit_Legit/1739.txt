Good morning,

I'm going to be off the grid for most of the day traveling to DC. Can we
add this to the chair's briefing on the WHCD?
There is a seating chart attached. Howard Saltz, the Sun-Sentinel's
publisher, would like to introduce her to some folks from the Sun-Sentinel
and the Tribune company.

See below. They're at Table 54. His cell number is 954-802-9516.

Thanks,

Ryan

Tribune Publishing=E2=80=99s corporate executives and LATimes publisher/edi=
tor will
be in attendance. I will find them and make introductions. They are:

   - Justin Dearborn, CEO of Tribune Publishing.
   - Tim Ryan, President of Tribune Publishing.
   - Davan Maharaj, editor/publisher of the Los Angeles Times.

Attached is a list of our personnel and their table assignments. There
might be some last-minute changes, but this is essentially it.

Tribune Publishing will have four tables. There will  be the
publishers/editors-in-chief from the Chicago Tribune, South Florida
Sun-Sentinel, Orlando Sentinel, Hartford Courant, Baltimore Sun, Allentown
(PA) Morning Call and Newport News (VA) Daily Press; their spouses; and
some key advertising clients from each market. Filling out the tables will
be our Washington reporters and some other dignitaries.

I=E2=80=99m still checking on our corporate executives and the editor/publi=
sher
from the Los Angles Times. I believe they will be there, but I do not have
table assignments for them yet.

I would be happy to facilitate introductions with the congresswoman. I=E2=
=80=99m at
Table 54. My cellphone is 954-802-9516.

Thanks for your help.

Mr. Saltz,

I'm sorry I missed your call the other day. I'm working with Congresswoman
Wasserman Schultz and we want to make sure she says hello to you and the
team at Saturday's dinner.

We're putting together some briefing materials. Will you please let me know
where you are sitting and who will be at your table?

Thank you,

Ryan
