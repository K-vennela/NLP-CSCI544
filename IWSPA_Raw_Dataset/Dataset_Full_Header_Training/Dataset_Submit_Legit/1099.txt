Subject: Question on Donald Trump's "Enabler" Attack on Sec. Clinton

Hello. I just spoke to someone with OrganizationPress and following up.

I am doing a freelance story for domain.com  about Donald Trump's attacks =
against Secretary Clinton as an "enabler" of President Clinton's alleged mi=
sconduct with women.

<<link>>
-cites-bill-clinton-infidelity-as-hillary-shrugs-off-personal-attacks.html

In at least some cases, past news reports and information from Judicial Wat=
ch indicate that Ms. Clinton might have been involved in the political stra=
tegy to domain.com some of the accusers -- both in allegations of misconduct=
 but also claims of a consensual relationship.

General questions:
1. I hoped the Organizationcould weigh in on the appropriateness of Trump attacking=
 along these lines?

2. From your view, why shouldn't women voters take into account Secretary C=
linton's past role in political strategy for responding to accusers of her =
husband?

I would really appreciate any response you have.

Thanks very much.
