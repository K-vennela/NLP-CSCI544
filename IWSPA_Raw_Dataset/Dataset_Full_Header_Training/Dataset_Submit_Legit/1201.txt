Today in the call for a full, nine bench Supreme Court: Senate Democrats jo=
in environmental advocates to discuss importance of filling the Supreme Cou=
rt vacancy, Florida Republican Senate candidate David Jolly calls for Garla=
nd nomination hearing and a vote, while editorial boards and political anal=
ysts continue to note the poisonous political game Senate Republicans are p=
laying over Chief Judge Garland's nomination.

Senate Democrats And Environmental Advocates Call On Republican Senators: #=

Today, Senator Barbara Boxer, Senator Brian Schatz, Senator Martin Heinrich=
 and Senator Ed Markey joined NextGen Climate, Green for All, League for Co=
nservation Voters and Clean Water Action on the steps of the U.S. Supreme C=
ourt with a clear demand for Senate Republicans: do your job by giving Pres=
ident Obama's Supreme Court nominee full and fair consideration. A video of=
 the event can be found here<<<link>>

Sen. Boxer (D-CA): "We cannot afford to have a deadlocked court, which coul=
d lead to different rules in different parts of the country and inconsisten=
t protections for public health and the environment."

Sen. Heinrich (D-NM): "Challenges to the President's Clean Power Plan will =
ultimately end up being heard before the U.S. Supreme Court. This is precis=
ely the type of case that the American people cannot have end in a 4-4 tie.=
 It is my sincere hope that Republicans will end their obstructionism and t=
ake their jobs and constitutional duties seriously."

Sen. Schatz (D-HI): It's time for Senate Republicans to end the political g=
ames, fulfill their constitutional duty, and join us in restoring the Supre=
me Court to its full strength."

Sen. Markey (D-MA): "Landmark rulings on the Clean Water Act and the Clean =
Air Act explain why just one vacancy on this Supreme Court has such enormou=
s impact and why the stakes are so high. We simply cannot afford to have a =
vacancy on the Supreme Court for the sake of environmental and climate prot=
ections." [NextGen Press Release, 04/26/16<<<link>>

GOP Senate candidate: Chief Judge Merrick Garland deserves a vote.
During a debate last night, Rep. David Jolly (R-FL), who is currently runni=

Sen. Leahy calls Republican obstruction not a "history the Senate should be=
 proud of."
Speaking at the Kennedy Institute, Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Membe=
r Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) invoked the legacy of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy =
(D-Mass.), during whose tenure no pending Supreme Court nominee was denied =
a hearing and a vote.

Sen. Leahy: "These days, we certainly could use some more of Senator Kenned=
y's commitment to the Constitution,...[Senator Kennedy] understood the mome=
ntous nature of Supreme Court nominations, as well as the historic and cons=
titutionally-mandated role of the Senate....To deny Chief Judge Garland a p=
ublic hearing and a vote would be truly historic - but that is not the kind=
 of history the Senate should be proud of." [Senator Leahy Press Release, 0=

Salt Lake Tribune: Hatch should reciprocate and consider Garland nomination=
 for Supreme Court.
The editorial board of the Salt Lake Tribune<<<link>>
3817394-155/editorial-hatch-should-reciprocate-and-consider> urges Sen. Orr=
in Hatch (R-UT) to give Chief Judge Garland's nomination the same considera=
tion President Obama gave Ronald G. Russell, who is now awaiting Senate act=
ion on his nomination to the U.S. District Court for Utah.

"But Utah's elder statesman has two good reasons to break from the pack, st=
op the partisan melodrama and show leadership, to spend some of the politic=
al capital that he has accumulated over four decades. Merrick Garland and R=
onald G. Russell are nominees he admires. Instead of contributing to poison=
ous politics, he could actually do something to fix it, something to loosen=
 the appointment logjam and help courts function the way they are intended.=
...Obama acted on your choice to fill a federal judgeship in Utah. You shou=
ld reciprocate. It is what Utahns elected you to do."

Republican Senators can blame McConnell for "forcing them to carry the alba=
tross of Garland obstructionism around their necks."

"Yes, blocking a nominee from Obama will appeal to the hard-right base of t=
