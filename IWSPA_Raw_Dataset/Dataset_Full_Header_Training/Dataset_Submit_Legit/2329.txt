Here it is. Andy from research already took a look. Adding Patrice to the c=
hain since it=92s her byline.

TITLE: Years in the Making: How the Organizationprepared to nominate the next Presi=
dent of the United States

BYLINE: Patrice Taylor

We=92re less than 100 days away from the 2015 Democratic National Conventio=
n in beautiful Philadelphia, PA, where our party will nominate the 45th Pre=
sident of the United States. If history teaches us anything, it will be a b=
eautiful moment.

[VINE]<<<link>>>

But what folks might not know is just how long moments like that take to co=
me together. Our party has been working for years to make sure that the pro=
cess for selecting our nominee is transparent, fair, and reflects our value=
s as Democrats. I=92ve been there every step of the way, and wanted to shar=
e what we=92ve been doing to prepare for the big moment in Philly:

2014: Committee Meetings (a lot of them)

The Organization is just like a lot of other committees yo=
u may have served on: It=92s made up of committee members, and those member=
s serve on subcommittees that have jurisdiction over various aspects of par=
ty business. I work closely with the Rules and Bylaws committee, which met =
five times in 2015 to finalize the selection rules for delegates to the 201=
6 convention.

vention floor

Like they have for the past 30 years, the 2015 delegate selection rules inc=
lude a number of unpledged =93super=94 delegates (about 15% of the total nu=
mber of delegates). These party leaders, just like the delegates allocated =
in caucuses and primaries, each get one vote on the convention floor.

Here=92s the most important thing to take away from what we decided in 2014=
 (and for every presidential contest since the 1980s): Unpledged delegates =
have never changed the outcome of an election. We decided to, once again, k=
eep our party leaders included at every stage of the nominating process, bu=
t the ultimate decision will be made by delegates selected through caucuses=
 and primaries.

2015: State Parties=92 Turn

Those caucuses and primaries are driven by state and territory parties, and=
 in 2015, every party had to domain.com their official delegate selection plan =
to the Rules and Bylaws committee. The Rules and Bylaws committee held many=
 meetings (over lots and lots of coffee) to make sure that the state party =
plans met our official delegate selection rules and reflected our commitmen=
t to diversity and inclusion.

[IMAGE<<<link>>
72157631457258210/>] Caption: Delegates at the 2015 Democratic National Con=
vention

To make sure that their state process reflects the values of our party and =
the political realities of their state, all delegate selection plans were o=
pen for public comment for at least 30 days, so that voters could see and h=
ave a say in how their state would be represented in the nominating process=
. States also submitted inclusion and outreach plans to make sure no voices=
 were left unheard.

2016: Have Your Say

Finally, it=92s time to select the delegates who will make up the vast majo=
rity of those who will nominate our candidate for President of the United S=
tates. Following the processes set by the states and territories and approv=
ed by the Rules and Bylaws committee last year, Democrats across the countr=
y have been making their voices heard in their caucuses and primaries.

Based on how Democrats in your state voted, delegates are proportionally al=
located to our presidential candidates. This is different than many GOP sta=
te parties=92 rules - none of our contests are winner take all. If your can=
didate gets at least 15% of the vote, they will be represented by your stat=
e to the convention in Philadelphia.

And, of course, these delegates have pledged to represent in good faith the=
 intentions of those who elected them.

July will be here before we know it, and all of the delegates you carefully=
 selected when you cast your vote or attended your primary will be packing =
up and heading to the City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection. I can=
=92t domain.com to watch them cast their votes - and represent you - as they nomi=
nate our 45th President. See you in Philadelphia.

We=92ll make sure to work the RBC into it, but it won=92t be a straight cop=

I think this could become a medium, but it'll take a little bit of work. I =
like the idea of sending it as a memo to talkers and creating something mor=
e domain.com-y for a wider audience to launch next week.
