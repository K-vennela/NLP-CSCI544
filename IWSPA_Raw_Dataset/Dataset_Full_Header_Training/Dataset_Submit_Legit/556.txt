- DECEMBER 07, 2015 -DONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON PREVENTING MUSLIM
IMMIGRATION

(New York, NY) December 7th, 2015, -- Donald J. Trump is calling for a
total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our
country's representatives can figure out what is going on. According to Pew
Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large
segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center
for Security Policy

released
data showing "25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans
here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad" and
51% of those polled, "agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice
of being governed according to Shariah." Shariah authorizes such atrocities
as murder against non-believers who won't convert, beheadings and more
unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women.

Mr. Trump stated, "Without looking at the various polling data, it is
obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred
comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to
determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses,
our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that
believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human
life. If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America
Great Again." - *Donald J. Trump*
