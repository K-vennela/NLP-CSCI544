what is not clear to me is the fact that we need to domain.com additional two months for closing something that should have been already settled months ago. I am closing our financial year and as you certainly know this is an old receivable and I can not afford to keep it open as it is now. Do you think you can do it by the end of this month?

thanks

I am sorry but after months of discussion your proposed date is not acceptable to us. June 15th is after the expiration of the current maintenance contract.

I would really appreciate your revision of the situation to get the payment done in the next days in order to avoid any service interruption to the end user.

I am sure you will understand,

Best regards

Oggetto: Invoices Balance Dear Mesfer,  as anticipated by our Account Manager Emad I write to request you an update about our invoices balance.  Here below a short recap of the situation:  Invoice No. AmountCollected amountBalance157/2012€ 370.500,00€ 351.975,00€ 18.525,00045/2013€ 28.500,00€ 18.525,00€ 9.975,00048/2013€ 39.000,00€ 33.150,00€ 5.850,00 From an accounting point of view, the income of eur 18.525,00 received on Jan. 21st 2015 should be allocated to balance our invoice No. 157/2012, instead of considering it as an advanced payment for the invoice No. 045/2013.  It means that for us the invoice No. 045/2013 is totally due and it remains also a balance to receive for the invoice No. 048/2013 (eur. 5.850); expected total amount is eur 34.350. If it was applied a withhold tax, we need to receive as soon as possible the related certificate; otherwise we consider the pending balance abovementioned.  I kindly request you to give me a feedback about this matter by next Wednesday, in order to solve it.Best regards,  Simonetta Gallucci
