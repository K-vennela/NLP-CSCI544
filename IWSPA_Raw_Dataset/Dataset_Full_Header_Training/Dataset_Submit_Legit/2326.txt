Morning guys, I know this is a busy day, but if you have it handy, do you m=
ind sending me the rundown of Potus endorsements this cycle?  I have an old=
er version, but want to make sure I have the most recent.

Also, I thought Juliet's story was about as expected-- not too terrible. =20

Thanks,
Jen
