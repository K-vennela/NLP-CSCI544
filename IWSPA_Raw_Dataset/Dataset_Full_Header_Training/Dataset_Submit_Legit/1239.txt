Hi Amy,

Thanks again for your time yesterday.  We all appreciate having the opportunity for candid conversation with you.

I wanted to touch base about the 2015 WLF Conference and strategize about how to pick dates.  I hope we can still plan to have a conference this fall despite the chaotic calendar.
In the past, I've announced the dates to the general public by mid-May.  I've tried to take important dates this fall into account below for your reference.  Do you have advice as to how to plan ahead without knowing our how eventual nominee will fit into all of this?

Important fall dates:
Tuesday, September 13 -26 - UNGA (POTUS speech Sept 19?)
Monday, September 26 - First Presidential Debate
Monday, October 3 - Tuesday, October 4 - Rosh Hashana
Tuesday, October 4 - First Vice Presidential Debate
Sunday, October 9 - Second Presidential Debate
Wednesday, October 12 - Yom Kippur
Wednesday, October 19 - Third Presidential Debate

WLF conference options
All options are Thursday/Friday combos.
September 22-23
September 29-30
October 6-7
October 27-28

I'm happy to reach out to Carol and Cynthia to get their input as well if you think that's appropriate at this point.

Thanks in advance,
Claire
