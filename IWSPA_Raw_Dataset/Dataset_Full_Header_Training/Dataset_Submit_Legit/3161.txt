 If ever there was a fact pattern where we should own zero of this film, and just charge fees with a backstop, this is it. #’s are clear that just taking fees is the way to go…… no downside at all (actually an EBIT positive as well as an ultimate positive) and with 10% fees, we are BETTER (and with 8% fees we are better until about 100m WW) than owning 25% of the film until about 125m WW.. Thxg
