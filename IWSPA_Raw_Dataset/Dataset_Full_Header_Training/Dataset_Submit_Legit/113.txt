It's a stupid hit at 7:30pm on a Friday. It will have zero impact. Totally pointless.

I also don't like that he got huffy with me/thinks we'll jump at his every command.

If we get ridiculed, the blame is squarely on him.

Zac really wants to do this release. I passed initially and he got pissed. So, I put this together to keep the peace.

SL: Expert Confirms Trump Lied

Earlier today Donald Trump flatly denied that his voice was the one found<<<link>>> on tapes of conversations with a publicist named "John Miller." But a forensic analyst just confirmed to CNN that, in his estimation, Trump lied about it and was pretending to be his own a publicist on multiple occasions during dealings with reporters over the past three decades. This is just the latest in a long string of lies and half-truths from Trump, and more proof he does not have the judgment or temperament to be president.
