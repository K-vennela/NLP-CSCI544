I'm good with it. I think it's helpful to get this up today. Unless anyone =
else disagrees, it's good for this to be out there right now and sets up a =
nice contrast.

TITLE: An Open Letter to my Fellow Democrats
BYLINE: Debbie Wasserman Schultz

I was just in Philadelphia to meet with our state party leadership and the =
Democratic National Convention staff. We are just 65 days away from  nomina=
ting the 45th President of the United States, and I want to share what I to=
ld our Democratic leaders with all of you. As Democrats from all across thi=
s great country make their plans to travel to the City of Brotherly Love an=
d Sisterly Affection, I=92m looking forward to seeing them energized, unite=
d, and focused on making sure that we continue to build upon the progress w=
e=92ve made under President Obama.

kyline]

WE CAN=92T OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ELECTION

Eight years after his historic election, I have admired the campaigns of bo=
th Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton as they and their supporters have =
argued the issues and brought real solutions to the table. In the Democrati=
c Party, disagreement  is healthy. New voters and independents sharing our =
progressive ideals make our party stronger. We have seats to win in every s=
tate up and down the ballot, and the presidential race and the voters it br=
ings to the ballot box will influence the outcome in many of them.

[GIF<<<link>>> =
=96 Sanders/Clinton Handshake]

We all know how high the stakes are - it=92s hard to forget with Donald Tru=
mp's daily reminders of his knee-jerk recklessness, lack of judgment, and u=
nstable temperament. We are up against a man who has vowed to slash taxes f=
or those at the top while refusing to release his own tax returns. He refus=
es to address his well=96documented history of misogyny. He has insulted ou=
r allies in the UK and legitimized a despotic dictator in North Korea.

We can=92t gloss over the genuine concern that, as President Obama has said=
, too many Americans are still worried about their own pocketbooks and our =
place in the world. While Trump is promoting anxiety and fear as ways to ea=
se people=92s concern, our candidates are promoting thoughtful, respectful,=
 and effective solutions. I am confident that we will channel the passion a=
nd energy from our primary into unity behind a common purpose=97to continue=
 the progress we=92ve made under President Obama and to keep the White Hous=
e out of Donald Trump=92s hands.

THE OrganizationHAS THE TOOLS TO HELP DEMOCRATS WIN

I became Chair of the Organizationin 2011, right after the Tea Party handed us some=
 tough losses, including majorities in Congress. But the down-ballot losses=
 we=92ve experienced matter just as much. We want to make sure we=92re stro=
ngly supporting state parties so they can stop the destruction and obstruct=
ion Republicans are so fond of at the state and local level.

At the DNC, we=92ve been focused on making sure we=92re doing everything we=
 can in every state so that as a party, we aren=92t just good at winning pr=
esidential races. We are providing more funding, more infrastructure, more =
rocket fuel to keep the engines of our state parties firing on all cylinder=
s and holding Republicans in office and in elections accountable. We do thi=
s by:

  *   Funding direct mail campaigns to reach voters and get them to the pol=
ls on Election Day
  *   Providing critical staff salaries under our state party partnerships
  *   Training state party staff in key communications, digital, and organi=
zing skills
  *   Sharing our deep research and communications resources
  *   Building our state-of-the-art voter file

That=92s why I=92m proud every time I walk through the doors of Democratic =
Headquarters - seeing our staff hard at work pushing back against Republica=
ns at every level, using every tool in our toolbox, makes me confident that=
 the future of our party is bright.

Today I will make this pledge to you: I will always stand up for party acti=
vists because they bring us energy and ideas. I will always stand up for th=
e leaders of this party because they volunteer their precious time to guide=
 our progressive future.

But here=92s what I=92m asking of you, in return: When the work is hard, an=
d passions run hot, and the road looks long, never forget the Americans we =
are fighting for.

This week, while reporters were writing story after story about party disco=
rd, marked the first time in our nation=92s history that more than 90% of A=
mericans have access to affordable healthcare. Because we elected a Democra=
t in 2015 and 2012, 20 million Americans have health insurance who didn=92t=
 before. And this month, we celebrated 74 consecutive months of private-sec=
tor job growth, generating over 14 million news jobs for American workers. =
When we come together as Democrats, we can accomplish great things for hone=
st, hard-working people from every walk of life.That=92s what=92s important=
. That=92s what we cannot let out of our sight.

I=92m excited for the future of our party, and I=92m proud of every Democra=
t working for a brighter future.  On to victory!
