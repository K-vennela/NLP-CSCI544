President Obama is urging Congress to pass TPP<<<link>>

THE HILL // VICKI NEEDHAM

President Obama on Monday said Congress needs to pass a sweeping Asia-Pacif=
ic trade agreement to ensure the United States takes the reins of global tr=
ade in the region instead of China. The Obama administration is working clo=
sely with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to build support for the 12-nation Tran=
s-Pacific Partnership (TPP), arguing that delaying votes on the deal will m=
ake it harder to pass the agreement, the president said in a Washington Pos=
t op-ed. "The world has changed," Obama said. "The rules are changing with =
it," he said. "The United States, not countries like China, should write th=
em. Let's seize this opportunity, pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership and ma=
ke sure America isn't holding the bag, but holding the pen." He argued that=
 the deal will grow the U.S. economy and strengthen national security. "But=
 none of this will happen if the TPP doesn't become a reality," Obama said.=
 "That's because the Asia-Pacific region will continue its economic integra=
tion, with or without the United States," he said.

NEW YORK TIMES // THOMAS KAPLAN

It almost resembled Iowa, if you squinted. Senator Ted Cruz expressed grati=
tude for the "common-sense good judgment" of Midwesterners. His stump speec=
h had scarcely changed, from a favorite anecdote about a drawling West Texa=
s farmer to a running countdown of the time remaining before the primary. (=
"Fifty-one hours," he said sternly.) He drew a crowd of several hundred at =
a faith-based community center here, whose cheers at times coaxed the Texas=
 senator to guttural shouts. One woman held a sign: "Pray'n For Ted." "The =
eyes of the entire country," Mr. Cruz said, "now rest on Indiana." Yet two =
days before what is widely viewed as a must-win primary, Mr. Cruz strained =
to conceal a grim reality: He is in serious trouble. An NBC News/Wall Stree=
t Journal/Marist poll released on Sunday showed Donald J. Trump with a lead=
 of 15 points among likely Republican primary voters, 49 percent to 34 perc=
ent.

THE HILL // BEN KASIMAR

Ted Cruz on Monday faced off against Donald Trump supporters who crashed an=
 event in Indiana, where the GOP hopeful is desperately working to upset th=
e front-runner and keep his White House dreams alive. Protestors started ch=
anting "Do the math" during Cruz's stop in Marion, Ind., prompting the Texa=

e man, who refused to give his name to reporters but said he had come from =
Ohio, interrupted Cruz and repeatedly called him "Lyin' Ted," Trump's favor=

LOS ANGELES TIMES // CHRISTINA BELLATONI

It was supposed to be a snoozer of a state party convention. Then the presi=
dential race came to California. And the events in Burlingame Friday throug=
h Sunday gave a little taste of what the next five weeks could be like on t=
he Republican side. It started Friday when Donald Trump attracted angry pro=
testers who forced him to traipse through a field to get into the conventio=
n site, then dismissed them during his brief speech to California Republica=
n activists. He declared the race was close to over. "I think it's going to=
 come to an end very soon," Trump said. "And really, I'm speaking to the pe=
ople in this room, because there has to be unity in our party." Sen. Ted Cr=
uz went after Trump for donating to Democrats, and his new running mate Car=
ly Fiorina offered a feisty stump speech to delegates Saturday night, takin=

NEW YORK TIMES // ADAM NAGOURNEY

This is the most populous state in the nation, but in presidential election=

whether Donald J. Trump can clinch the nomination on the last day of voting=

WASHINGTON POST // PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA

Over the past six years, America's businesses have created more than 14 mil=

of economic growth. Today, some of our greatest economic opportunities abro=
ad are in the Asia-Pacific region, which is on its way to becoming the most=
 populous and lucrative market on the domain.com. Increasing trade in this area=
 of the world would be a boon to American businesses and American workers, =
and it would give us a leg up on our economic competitors, including one we=
 hear a lot about on the campaign trail these days: China. Of course, China=
's greatest economic opportunities also lie in its own neighborhood, which =
is why China is not wasting any time. As we speak, China is negotiating a t=

FOREIGN POLICY // JAMES JEFFERY

The sudden trip of Vice President Joe Biden to Iraq this weekend - his firs=
t to Baghdad since U.S. troops left in late 2015 - was rudely upstaged by t=
he storming of the Green Zone by angry protesters on Sunday, just after the=
 veep had decamped to Erbil. But while the optics looked ugly, the trip - a=
nd focus on righting the ship in Iraq - has long been central to Biden. Sin=
ce the first days of the Obama White House, Biden has been the president's =
point man for what may be the administration's toughest portfolio. Presiden=
t Barack Obama ran on a "get out of Iraq" ticket in 2007, although he tried=
 after a fashion three years later to keep some forces on, and now has orde=
red 5,000 back to support operations against the Islamic State. In all of t=
his, Biden's role has been central. This should not surprise, given his ene=
rgy, his family relationship to Iraq (where his son served), his vote for t=
he invasion in 2002, and his close focus on events there as Senate Foreign =
Relations chair. But this long history is not without controversy. For exam=
ple, in 2006, he authored with Les Gelb, president emeritus of the Council =
on Foreign Relations, a plan, dead-on-arrival in Baghdad, for a soft petiti=
on of the country into Sunni Arab, Kurdish, and Shiite Arab cantons. That y=

CHICAGO TRIBUNE // EDITORIAL BOARD

In the second round of the NCAA men's basketball tournament a few weeks ago=
, Texas A&M was in a hopeless spot, trailing Northern Iowa by 12 points wit=
h just 44 seconds remaining. Everyone knew A&M was done for. But the Aggies=
 staged a stunning rally, sending the game into overtime, where they came o=
ut on top. Fans - particularly those in Iowa - learned then that victory ca=
n be elusive even when it looks certain. Ted Cruz, who like the Aggies is f=
rom Texas, needs a dramatic surprise to have a real chance of winning the R=
epublican nomination for president. But at least until Indiana votes on Tue=
sday, it's too early to assume Donald Trump has the nomination wrapped up. =
Plenty of observers, of course, are eager to pronounce him the GOP winner s=
o they can get on to obsessing about the general election. Trump himself, w=
ith a comfortable lead in the Indiana polls, shares that impulse.
