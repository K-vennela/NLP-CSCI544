Hi Dan, saw your story on the victory fund and wanted to make sure you had our perspective. You can quote me with this:

The suggestion there's anything unusual about our joint victory funds has no basis in the law or reality, as recognized by numerous independent experts that have looked at this. The fact is both campaigns signed on to similar agreements. While only one campaign is currently using their joint victory fund we encourage both of our campaigns to identify opportunities to support the national and state Democratic parties now so that we can continue to build the infrastructure to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November.

For background, for example, take a look at what the Election Law Blog posted: "it is hard to see what provision of the law" is at issue. As the blog points out, "legally" the criticism of the fund "seems weak."   <<link>><<<link>>>

Also on background, the math is wrong on the Politico story. Their claim that state parties only get to keep 1 percent of all the money being raised is incorrect and comparing apples and oranges. They reference the total amount of money that has been raised, but of that, many millions have been raised for state parties and just haven't been distributed to them yet (nor has it gone to the Organizationor anywhere else). Because this is money for the general election, and coordinated campaigns are just now starting to be built at state parties, it is perfectly understandable that not all of that money that will eventually go to state parties would have been distributed yet.
Happy to discuss at greater length.
