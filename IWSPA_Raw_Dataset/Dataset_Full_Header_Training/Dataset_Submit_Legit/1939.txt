Segment 3: Javier Becerra, Jan Brewer, Amanda Carpenter, Nina Turner

Campaign officials close to Cruz said he wanted Rubio to be his VP pick. Ru=
bio never expressed any interest at all. Rubio thought two senators from DC=
 teaming up would only contribute to Trump's outsider perspective. Do you t=
hink it would have worked?

Carpenter: Yes, it would have unified the party and presented a clear alter=
native to Trump. It was a missed opportunity.

Brewer: Rubio is a great guy, Cruz is a great guy, but the public has spoke=
n very clearly and loudly that they want someone who will represent the peo=
ple.

Assuming HRC is the nominee, how big a challenge do you think Trump will be=
 to her?

Becerra: you have to take everyone seriously but Trump doesn't even seem to=
 take himself seriously. HRC will outwork everyone and earn the votes she n=
eeds, already has more votes than he does.

Do you think whoever loses the Democratic nomination should be the nominee'=
s VP?

Turner: not necessarily. The race is still going on and Sanders still has a=
 chance. Democrats would do well not to take Trump for granted, this will b=
e a real race.

Now that Trump has locked up the nomination there is a lot of speculation a=
bout who is VP will be. Who is the favorite?

Brewer: I would be very willing to consider the VP slot. He doesn't necessa=
rily need to pick a women.

Carpenter: he wants someone who would be able to work with Congress on his =
behalf. Gingrich might be his only choice.

Becerra: he will have to find someone he is willing to share the stage with=
.

Turner: Should chose Kasich because of Ohio connections. Condi Rice is an i=
ntellectual and could bring some diversity to that campaign.

Segment 2: John McCain Interview

He looked pretty miserable during this interview.

Lindsey Graham said he would not support Trump or HRC. Are you ready to sup=
port Trump?

I've said all along that I will support the Republican nominee. HRC will ca=
use the economy to continue to stumble along and put us in the economic mal=
aise that we have had for 8 years.

Is party leadership out of touch with what the base of the party wants?

Have to draw the conclusion that there is some distance, maybe not a discon=
nect, between party leadership, members of Congress and many of the voters =
that selected Trump to be the nominee. A lot of it is older, white, blue co=
llar workers who see no prospect of a job. Young people who have large stud=
ent debt. The perception that there is gridlock in Washington has given ris=
e to both Trump and Sanders.

Should leadership listen to those that are disconnected a little better?

You have to listen to people that have chosen the nominee of our Republican=
 party, it would be foolish to ignore them.

Is there anything about Trump's foreign policy that is better than HRC's?

Trump emphasizes American leadership abroad. Obama does not want to lead. H=
RC does not have one accomplishment as Secretary of State that she can poin=
t to.

The Republican Party must maintain its viability as a party. McCain believe=
s the greatest president of the 20th century was Reagan. McCain will contin=
ue to make sure America's policy adheres to peace through strength.

Do you have confidence that Trump can be like Reagan?

He could be a capable leader. It is obvious there has to be outreach on his=
 part and heal many of the wounds.

McCain has never seen the personalization of a campaign like this where a p=
eople's integrity and character are questioned and it really bothers him. Y=
ou can violently disagree with someone on issues but to attack their charac=
ter and integrity, those wounds take a long time to heal.

Would you be seen on the same stage as Trump?

A lot of things would have to happen for that. Trump would need to express =
his appreciation for veterans, not John McCain, but veterans that were inca=
rcerated as prisoners of war. He needs to retract his statement that he doe=
sn't like people who are captured because it offends a body of American her=
oes out there.

Is Trump good or bad for your reelection bid?

I said that there is a Hispanic vote which I have to continue my good relat=
ionship with because of the turmoil that exists within this whole national =
campaign. Anyone that doesn't agree with that is unaware of the passing sce=
ne.

Would you want Trump to retract his statements about undocumented Mexican i=
mmigrants, when he called them rapists and criminals?

Oh, I don't know. It is important that we understand the importance of the =
hispanic vote in America.

*He didn't condemn the rapists and criminals comments.

What was the VP speculation game like for you in 2015 and how did you end u=
p with Palin?

Contrary to what has become popular opinion, Palin energized our ticket. Sh=
e beat Biden in a debate. Of course she made some mistakes but so did I. He=
 will not put his failure on Palin and he is very proud of her. She was tre=
ated terribly by the mainstream media.

What advice would you give Trump as he selects a VP?

Someone who would unite the party. Joni Ernst would be tremendous. Paul Rya=
n was helpful to the Romney ticket but I'm not sure he would want to do tha=
t again.

Segment 1: Sarah Palin Interview

**In the last question, she basically says that Americans don't really care=
 about abortion and they wan

Speaker Ryan said he is not ready to support Trump. If Ryan doesn't support=
 Trump, should he still be Speaker of the House?

Paul Ryan is going to end up like Eric Cantor - his political career is ove=
r. He needs to listen to the will of the people.

It screws Ryan's chances to run in 2015 if the Republican Party wins now.

Are you planning on supporting Ryan's primary challenger?

Yes, will do whatever she can for Ryan's opponent. Ryan's problem is that h=
e has become so disconnected from the people who elected him. Paul Ryan and=
 the establishment feel threatened at this point that their power, prestige=
, purse will be adversely affected by the change that is coming with Trump.

Ryan said he was very concerned with the tone Trump has taken, the Muslim b=
an, deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants, comments about women. You=
 don't believe he is concerned with these things?

Those concerns are relatively speaking superficial, talking about tone and =
certain verbiage as opposed to what Ryan would have chose to talk about.

The people of America care about getting things done finally, taking our go=
vernment back and putting it on our side.

This weekend Trump went after HRC and her husband's infidelity. What do you=
 think of that line of attack?

A lot of people may be obsessed with public figures personal lives but for =
the most part Americans are concerned with things like who will be able to =
appoint the next SCOTUS justice. People care about that much more so than B=
ill Clinton's obvious indiscretions and Donald Trump having been divorced a=
 couple times and owning up to it.

Are you willing to be vetted for Trump's VP slot?

I think i am pretty much as vetted as anyone in the country could be vetted=
 at this point.

She wants to help and not hurt - she is a realist and realizes there are a =
lot of people out there that would consider her a burden on the ticket. She=
 just wants Trump and America to win.

Republicans are worried about his poor standing with women voters, 7 of 10 =
have an unfavorable view of him. Do you wince when he says things like "wom=
en have it better than men" on the trail?

Heck, no. He is saying what a lot of other people are thinking, he just hap=
pens to be the most candid about it. She knows Trump and appreciated that h=
e has respect for women - he listens to the prominent women in his life lik=
e his daughter and wife.

John McCain has publicly maintained that Trump would not have much of an im=
pact on his campaign in Arizona but behind closed doors he said Trump might=
 hurt his reelection bid - over 30% of voters in Arizona are Hispanic. How =
is Trump going to improve his standing with Latino voters?

Palin gives a lot more domain.com to Latino voters than the mainstream media wo=
uld in terms of believing that they all have a herd mentality and vote for =
only one candidate.

Wishes politicians wouldn't worry about racial divides that are for the mos=
t part made up by those that thrive on division.

Trump recently said he wants to change platform as it relates to abortion t=
o include exceptions for rape, incest, life of mother. Do you agree?

She does not want the platform to change. When it comes to abortion, it is =
very sensitive and a personal issue. The platform is the way it should be r=
ight now. When we can agree that the platform should stay as it is now, the=
n we can talk about things that people are really concerned about and that =
is debt, open borders, illegal immigrants coming over and receiving freebie=
s instead of our people and especially vets, growing government - the intru=
sion that the failed liberal agenda perpetuates.

**She is basically saying that the American people aren't really concerned =
about a women's abortion rights and would rather focus on other issues.
