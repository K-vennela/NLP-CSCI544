On the national call we are going to use Carson and either Holmes Norton or Cummings. Those names are on recommendation of T&I cmte minority comms director. We can add in Price if you already reached out and he says yes. I need to run it by Carson.

I am waiting to hear back from Rep. Price about doing a call tomorrow. He's the leading Democrat on the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee.

Rep. Frankel may be interested and available.
