Kay and Jake, thank you for your help this weekend. If you continue to get =
questions, here are points to help guide you on why the Chair was invited, =
and her background:

  *   President Barack Obama tapped Wasserman Schultz to lead the Democrati=
c National Committee as Chair during his re-election campaign in 2011. In j=
ust 17 months and while maintaining a 95% voting record in Congress, she tr=
aveled to 31 states and 171 cities as the OrganizationChair campaigning for Preside=
nt Obama and Democrats up and down the ballot.
  *   She headlined 894 events (roughly 52 per month) for the Obama re-elec=
tion campaign, Democratic incumbents and candidates, and state parties. Thi=
s is all in addition to running her own re-election campaign which she won =
with 62% of the of vote.
  *   Following the re-election, Wasserman Schultz was asked by the Preside=
nt to serve another term at the Organization responsible f=
or paying down the $24 million in campaign debt from the 2015 presidential =
election -- which she has done -- and to prepare for the 2015 primary and g=
eneral elections. Wasserman Schultz is only the third woman to serve as the=
 OrganizationChair and is on track to becoming the longest serving Chair in half a =
century.
  *   As Chair she has reinvested in the State Party Partnerships that were=
 the hallmark of the 50 State Strategy begun by one of her predecessors, Ho=
ward Dean, and while paying off the 2015 election debt entirely, Wasserman =
Schultz has also increased investments in the state parties by 50% over the=
 previous baseline, while investing in national infrastructure like our vot=
er file, communications, digital and research support for state parties tha=
t's making a difference nationwide.
  *   Debbie Wasserman Schultz=92s cherishes being a legislator. She has se=
rved her constituents in South Florida for nearly 25 years after having bee=
n the youngest woman elected to the Florida state legislature - at 26 - and=
 the first Jewish woman elected to the U.S. Congress from the state of Flor=
ida.
  *   Just ten weeks after taking office in Washington, D.C., she led the f=
ight and stood up to the GOP establishment and President George W. Bush whe=
n Congress took action to require Terri Schiavo=92s husband to keep her on =
life support =96 a complete slap in the face to our constitutional right to=
 privacy and separation of church and state.
  *   There is no advocate for women, children, and young families like Deb=
bie Wasserman Schultz. In 2007, she sponsored the Virginia Graeme Baker Poo=
l & Spa Safety Act named after Secretary of State James Baker=92s granddaug=
hter who died when she became trapped in a pool drain. Drowning is the numb=
er one cause of unintentional death for children under 5 years of age and s=
ince this law was passed, there have been NO drownings in the entire countr=
y due to entrapments like what happened to Virginia.
  *   Next, she teamed up with then Senator Joe Biden to pass the Protect O=
ur Children Act. This bill gave law enforcement the tools and resources the=
y need to track down and prosecute criminals exploiting children online. Ev=
en when GOP obstructionist number one, Tom Coburn, held up the bill, Debbie=
 Wasserman Schultz fought tooth and nail to get it passed into law.
  *   In 2008, while campaigning for then Senator Barack Obama, she quietly=
 faced her own personal battle with breast cancer. After seven surgeries, w=
inning her own reelection, and electing the first African American Presiden=
t to the White House, she told the world her cancer story by doing what els=
e - holding a press conference to introduce the Education and Awareness Req=
uires Learning Young Act - the EARLY Act. This law provides critical funds =
and directs the Centers for Disease Control to educate young women and heal=
th care providers, that young women in fact can and do get breast cancer an=
d build awareness for those women who are at higher or genetic risk for thi=
s disease.
  *   Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been a champion for progressive values a=
nd working families her entire career. She's used her voice and her vote to=
 support a $15 minimum wage, was a champion for the Affordable Care Act, an=
d is the lead sponsor in Congress to fully fund the Zika virus crisis which=
 is a major health concern in her home state of Florida and across the coun=
try.
  *   Michelle Obama was right when President Obama nominated her to chair =
the DNC: =93If you want something done, give it to a busy woman.=94 Well, P=
resident Barack Obama found the busiest one out there and named her OrganizationCha=
ir not once, but TWICE!

what else - holding a press conference to introduce the Education and Aware=
ness Requires Learning Young Act - the EARLY Act. This law provides critica=

President Barack Obama tapped Wasserman Schultz to lead the Democratic Nati=
onal Committee as Chair during his re-election campaign. In just 17 months =
and while maintaining a 95% voting record in Congress, she traveled to 31 s=
