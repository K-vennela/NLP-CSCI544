Comrades,
The NSM broke another record this weekend by enlisting more recruits in one
weekend than ever before. Not only did we enlist a solid group of new
members in Missouri this weekend, but new recruits from other parts of the
Nation also joined the ranks.
There is so much I could say about how well the entire event went this past
weekend in MO., from the March to the Swastika lighting, to the feast, the
whole atmosphere and our Folk in general. Furthermore, the Texas troops too=
k
to the streets proving that the NSM has enough troops to spread out our
forces.
The NSM is now stronger than ever, as recent events have proven. Check out
the pictures on www.nsm88.org and see Lt. Boswell's after action report
below:
