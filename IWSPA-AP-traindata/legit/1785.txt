Hails Brother,
I just read this after going through a bunch of mail. Do not worry abou NSM
dues, we will put you on a waiver until things get better for you. Your work
on Staff is more important than $10. a month anyways, reliable help is hard
to find. Yeah, the ranks are swelling, but solid reliable help is still a
precious resource (don't laugh, its true, ha ha). The end of the NSM is
retarded as Ramsey himself, that homosexual still calls me every single day
and leaves weirdo messages. Perhaps if he found a girlfriend he could stop
being so gay. His behavior is like a text book page out of some jewish
handbook.
No one will think ill of you if you do not have the funds to be at
Nationals, I have been there and done that in regards to having nothing and
have done the homeless thing in the past too (years ago), so no worrys
Brother. If you do make it, and are cash strapped, let me know and we will
make some sort of acomodations for you. I refuse to let any good man go
hungry at an NSM event, and you know damn well we have plenty of good people
that will share a room, a ride, or whatever. 88
