We need to have a conversation about this then, I think. If the line is that we don't talk to them or do anything with them, just see them at convention and go our separate ways, then that's fine, but I need to know it so I stop jumping up and down on a dead horse.
I think there's a big argument to be made for why we shouldn't shut them out but I'm not going to keep pushing this with you if you don't want to hear it.
On the roundtable-Jefferson's available so long as we're in and out of there between 1 and 6 PM.
Ron Abramson said that he doesn't think he has enough rich friends to host. I think he could actually do it but I wanted to check with you about going back to him to encourage him to host.
Lastly, Sreedhar-he's onboard for another max out for the roundtable but I really think it's worth it for us to push for a POTUS note for him. I can go into the whole spiel here but I realize this is already a long email and the likelihood of you reading this far is low.
Thanks!
