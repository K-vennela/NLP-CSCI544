William,
Hopefully I have what you would call a decent understanding of Socialist
ideals.  From what I have read and believe it has alot to do with doing away
with the capitalist bull-shit that has a monster-like grip over us and
giving power back to those who deserve it.  Such as the hard working white
men.  I am going to look into the literature you recommended and I found
your email address on nsm.com I was so surprised to find a Fargo chapter by
the way.
