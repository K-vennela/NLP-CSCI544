Hails!  I wanted to check in with you to see how things were going out your way. any new projects that you are working on. We've got a lot going on within the region, as well as media projects. Speaking of which, would you like to submit anything for the upcoming newsletter I think your writing skills would prove invaluable to our Comrades around the country. Would you like to work on other projects, using some of your communication skills in spreading he good word.  Get back to me, and let me know how you are doing.  I hope to touch base with you soon.
