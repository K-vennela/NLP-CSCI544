PLEASE FORWARD THIS MESSAGE
Some people see bad conditions and lament. Still others get angry. A very
few have the personal courage and responsibility to do something about it.
Pastor Michael Davis of Mount Olive Ministries, Tarpon Springs, Florida, is
one of the few.
Pastor Davis' church is in the Union Academy neighborhood of Tarpon Springs,
an area that is ravaged by drug abuse and addiction. Drug deals take place
right down the street from the church.
With full knowledge that something could be done about it, he has been
looking for a solution. What he found is the Narconon program by L. Ron
Hubbard. Pastor Davis is on his training to open a Narconon center and has
applied for his license.
And he's already in action. In public libraries in Holiday and Tarpon
Springs, Pastor Davis has delivered two lectures, delivering the truth about
drugs to the people of the community. Education is vital to handle the drug
problem and he will continue to promote and deliver this free service.
In order to handle those who have already fallen into drug addiction, Pastor
Davis intends to open a full Narconon as soon as possible. Here's where you
come in. Pastor Davis needs your help. We need to raise at least $100,000 in
order to get the Narconon center open this year. You can make your
tax-deductible donations directly to Mt. Olive Ministries.
Each day, more and more people in this community take that first step that
will lead to a life of misery and slavery to drugs. Will you lament, get
angry, or take action?
Please call or email me. I'll arrange for you to meet Pastor Davis
personally and hear his vision for the future of his neighborhood, his town,
the state, the country, and for all people on Earth.
