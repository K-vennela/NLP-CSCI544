Dear Carl,
This issue is now covered in the version of the manuscript that I sent 
out on Friday. The d2* and d3* statistics have been removed. The new d1* 
statistic DOES involve the standard error of the model average trend in 
the denominator (together with the adjusted standard error of the 
observed trend; see equation 12 in revised manuscript). The slight irony 
here is that the new d1* statistic essentially reduces to the old d1* 
statistic, since the adjusted standard error of the observed trend is 
substantially larger than the standard error of the model average trend...
With best regards,
Ben
