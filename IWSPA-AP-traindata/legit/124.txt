Ben,
I hope the surgery next week goes OK. Ruth and I are going away next
week for a short break to Coldstream on the River Tweed. This was the
holiday cottage Matthew had planned to go to for his honeymoon, but the
fuel crisis around his wedding time precluded this. We were able to
negotiate the cottage for a later date, as we could get a refund or
claim on the insurance as a national emergency wasn't declared. So on
Nov 1 we will think about you !
I've listed off the diagrams and will take the text when it comes, but
I won't be able to send you any comments until the week of Nov 6.
Also just sent back comments to Mike Mann on the paper by Tom and
you factoring out ENSO and Volcanoes. Felt like writing red ink all over
it, but sent back a short publish suject to minor revision to Mike. This
is the first time I've ever reviewed one of Tom's or your papers !
Copy of what I sent is attached. I forgot to sign it before sending it !
Again hope all is well later next week !
Cheers
Phil
