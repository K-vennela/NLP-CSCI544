Hey. Don't panic (great way to start an email at 10:45 pm).
The discussion below happened and one more I'm about to forward you. Kate suddenly thought I was sending DWS into a lobbying/leg session breakfast tomorrow morning which I am NOT doing. It's going to be political gossip and a very low key breakfast.
Holler if you want to talk.
