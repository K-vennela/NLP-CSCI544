THIS TIME I'M GOING TO PUT IN THE LINK TELLING YOU
WHERE TO SEND THE LETTER. OOPS. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
-Doyle
An interesting article about lobotomies was printed in
today's Tampa Tribune.
A lobotomy is a brutal psych technique in which they
rip apart a portion of the brain to "treat" mental
illness.
The article text is at the bottom of this email.
At one time, this was psychiatry's "safe and
effective" treatment. Now the same group claims that
treating mental illness with powerful, mind-altering
drugs is "safe and effective". Do you believe them? Me
neither.
We need to bring the public's attention to this psych
atrocity that maimed and killed thousands of patients.
We need to point out that there was no science to
psychiatry then and there is no science now.
Mainly, we are just communicating the same messages as
before:
-no science to psychiatry
-no chemical imbalance
-Tom Cruise was right
-Psych methods are dangerous and deadly
-Psychiatry is fraud
