QUOTE OF THE DAY
“Think fruit” — The US Forest Service’s suggestion for how to make your S’mores healthier. Since grilled pineapple’s the same as chocolate. Said no one ever.

THINGS STRESSING OBAMA OUT 
ISIS                              
THE STORY
Over the weekend, President Obama said he’s ready to unveil a long-term game plan for taking down ISIS. And the US expanded its airstrikes. Happy Monday.
WHAT’S OBAMA’S PLAN?
No idea. He’s going to tell us on Wednesday. We do know that the US won’t be going it alone. Last week, the UK, France and others said they’re on board to de-IS.
WHAT‘S HAPPENING NOW?
More US airstrikes. This time to protect Iraq’s second-biggest dam, which provides water for millions of people. It’s the first time US airstrikes have hit ISIS territory near Baghdad.

Obama said this is not another Iraq war and that putting US troops on the ground would be a “mistake.” But it’s looking like the fight against ISIS is not ending anytime soon…
IMMIGRATION                              
THE STORY
Remember when President Obama said that fixing US immigration policy was a big priority this year? And that he’d get it done by the end of the summer? Never mind.
WHAT’S THE HOLDUP?
Two words: election year. The GOP hasn’t been shy about letting voters know they think Obama’s been doing too many things without Congress. Dems would really –really – like to keep control of the Senate in November. So many of them have been quietly asking Obama to ixnay on the executive action-ay.
theSKIMM
What do you get when you mix a key voting bloc, an election year, and an influx of unaccompanied minors crossing the US border? A melting pot of issues. Immigration is an even bigger subject this year and Obama’s delay has managed to tick off some Dems, Republicans, and Latinos.
REPEAT AFTER ME... 
WHAT TO SAY WHILE UPDATING AN OFFICE FAQ DOC…
No, racism, please. Atlanta Hawks co-owner Bruce Levenson recently turned over an email to the NBA that he’d written two years ago because turns out…it was kind of racist. Now, he’s selling his share of the team. In the email, Levenson made some…observations…about the team’s fan base and said “my theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites.”  Earlier this year, Levenson pushed for the NBA to say bye to former Clippers owner Donald Sterling after his mess. The NBA said Levenson’s email was not OK but gave him props for self-reporting. Unlike the guy wearing The Sterling Letter. So yeah, the bar was low. Meanwhile, some people think Levenson was just looking for an easy way to ball out — by selling his stake at a time when the value of NBA teams has never been higher.

WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR FRIEND SAYS SHE MISSES BEING SINGLE…
How Scottish. Scotland’s been in a relationship with the UK (which also includes England, Wales, and Northern Ireland) for over 300 years. But now the Scots are voting in less than two weeks on whether or not to become independent. Scots who want to be single again argue that Scotland has the resources and economic power to fly free. Scotland’s move towards independence started in 2011, when the nationalist party (once considered fringe) came into power and started talking as loud as bagpipes about a referendum vote. Now, for the first time, polls show that people are leaning toward independence. Britain hyperventilated and is offering Scotland incentives to stay.

WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR CO-WORKERS WON’T STOP TALKING FOOTBALL…
Size isn’t everything — let’s talk smaller balls. The US Open men’s final is today and it’s the first time in almost 10 years that a Grand Slam final hasn’t included one of the Big Four (aka Djokovic, Federer, Nadal, and Murray). Japan’s Kei Nishikori and Croatia’s Marin Cilic will hit it off instead. Meanwhile, yesterday, Serena Williams beat Caroline Wozniacki in the women’s final. It’s Williams’s 18th Grand Slam. Humble brag.

WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR FROYO’S MELTING…
Not like lava. Lava from a volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island is creepin’ up on some homes, and could reach them in about a week. The Big Island declared a state of emergency in a county, and officials said people should prepare to evacuate. In the ’90s, about 200 homes were destroyed from lava flows from the same volcano, which is one of the most active in the world.
