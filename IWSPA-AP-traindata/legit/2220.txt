I find it amusing in a way=2C for I have looked at your site=2C and it seem=
s that=2C 9 times out of 10=2C when someone gets arrested at one of your ra=
llies=2C its a protestor.

I will say this. I am not racist (though I am nationalist in the sense that=
we should take care of america first and other countries second) But I wil=
l state that you are correct that Racial equality is a hypocracy=2C but per=
haps in a different way.
What many people dont realize=2C is that when they say racial equality=2C t=
hey dont realize that they are actually meaning economic=2C religious=2C an=
d political equality. They only think that it means they have to treat them=
as if calling them racist names is "politically wrong" when it isnt=2C sin=
ce it isnt the governments decision to say what is politically right or wro=
ng to say (otherwise=2C they would have been forced to get rid of the NSM)

Racial equality when it comes to how we treat and think of them=2C that can=
not be accomplished so long as humans live on this earth. Thats the hypocra=
cy. People think racial equality means treating minorities to the highest s=
tandard. It doesnt. It just means giving them the same oppurtunities that a=
ny regular person gets. You dont have to treat them as if voicing your opin=
ion will get you in trouble.=20

Interestingly=2C I also find it funny how convinced of their opinion anti-w=
hite groups are. They show the same conviction as white supremecist groups.=
Goes to show that=2C in a way=2C neither side of the spectrum is right=2C =
nor is it wrong. It is merely how you view things in life.

Hope this doesnt confuse you too much. I can tend to get longwinded in such=
things.
