Good Tuesday morning. GETTING THERE: Washington, Inc., goes #Ever Trump! - JUST POSTED as lead of Politico ... "Trump opponents scramble to get on board: The presumptive nominee makes direct, personal overtures to mend a divided party," by Eli Stokols: "Trump's anti-establishment campaign may be authoring just the latest chapter in a familiar Washington story, exposing how the nation's political class may be motivated less by principle than by proximity to power.
"But some consultants credit Trump's willingness to listen to conservative leaders since becoming the party's new standard-bearer, which has mollified some of their preexisting anxieties or at least provided political cover for them to temper their criticism and even begin to offer praise and, in some cases, their services." <<link>>
SHOTS FIRED -- WashPost, bottom of A4, "Campaign turns nastier as Trump revives controversies around Bill Clinton," by Jose Del Real and Bob Costa: Trump posted "an incendiary Instagram video [with] voices of two women [Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey] who accused the former president of sexual assault ... Bill Clinton ... is shown smoking a cigar. ... [In a recent interview, Trump discussed] ... the suicide of former White House aide Vincent Foster ... 'It's the one thing with her, whether it's Whitewater or whether it's Vince or whether it's Benghazi. It's always a mess with Hillary.'" <<link>>
