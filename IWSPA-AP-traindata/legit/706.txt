Donald Trump has won the Nebraska Republican primary, according to three separate news networks.
Despite being the only Republican candidate left in the race after Ted Cruz and John Kasich both suspended their campaigns last week, Trump kept up his pace on the campaign trail. Before traveling to the Pacific Northwest states of Oregon and Washington, Trump stopped over in Omaha last Friday night.
Trump's victory in the state comes despite fierce opposition from freshman Sen. Ben Sasse, one of the first Republicans to come out against the party's presumptive nominee.
Nebraska awards its 36 delegates on a winner-take-all basis.
