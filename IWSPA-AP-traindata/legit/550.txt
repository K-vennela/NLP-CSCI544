Steven can you call me on this? –G.  From: Leon, George 
Hi Steven, I was hoping to get a quick read of what you think will happen with the Hotel T2 date  internationally.  I hear rumors that in the US it may move forward a week, will international change?  Can you read below and tell me what you think? –G.   From: Leon, George 
Thanks for today....I hope you found the discussion useful.  Meanwhile, can I get a "gut" check on an international date change for HotelT2? I was surprised to hear that maybe hotelT2 may go a week earlier in the US. Would that effect you and your international dates?  Do you think our international offices would go earlier too if the US does it? Currently we are trying to get LATAM McD's to do hotel t2. They were hoping we would instead move it to Oct1st to align windows but don't think that is going to happen.  Just a "gut" reaction..what do you think?
