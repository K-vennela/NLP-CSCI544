Peck et al,
I recall meeting David Deeming at a meeting years ago (~10).
He worked in boreholes then. I've seen his name on several of the
skeptic websites.
Kevin's idea is a possibility. I wouldn't post on the website 
'ukweatherworld'.
The person who sent you this is likely far worse. This is David Holland.
He is a UK citizen who send countless letters to his MP in the UK, writes
in Energy & Environment about the biased IPCC and has also been hassling
John Mitchell about his role as Review Editor for Ch 6. You might want to
talk to John about how he's responding. He has been making requests under
our FOI about the letters Review Editors sent when signing off. I'm 
sure Susan
is aware of this. He's also made requests for similar letters re 
WG2 and maybe 3.
Keith has been in contact with John about this.
I've also seen the quote about getting rid of the MWP - it would seem to go
back many years, maybe even to around the TAR.  I've no idea where it came
from. I didn't say it!
I've written a piece for RMS [popular journal Weather on the MWP 
and LIA - from a UK
perspective. It is due out in June. I can send if you want.
I'm away all next week - with Mike. PaleoENSO meeting in Tahiti - you can't
turn those sorts of meetings down!
Cheers
Phil
