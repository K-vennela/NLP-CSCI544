Crew,
If you're not familiar with the term "stigma", clear
it up. You're going to be hearing a lot more of it.
It means "A mark of shame or discredit" and it has
several other meanings found in a good dictionary. The
psychs are using this term as a trick to get more
people to accept their labeling and drugs. The way
they use it is very deceptive and suppressive. Psych
groups talk about erasing "stigma" from mental
illness, so it's "ok" to admit that you have a
permanent, incurable brain disease. Of course it isn't
true that they have a brain disease; it's a scam.
The way they use it is a little closer to one of its
other dictionary meanings: "A mark burned into the
skin of a criminal or slave; a brand".
The psychs totally created the stigma by claiming that
unwanted feelings and behaviors are indications of
"mental illness". Now they want it to be hidden, so
that more people will willingly become psych slaves.
Without psychiatry, such conditions would be
considered "life" and someone who suffered those
symptoms would seek out viable solutions like true
medical care, nutrition, detox, and increased
spiritual awareness. But the psychs don't want that.
The psychs want everyone to accept their marketing
line that all these behaviors and feelings indicate
"mental diseases" and the only hope is a psych pill,
electric shock through the brain, etc.
