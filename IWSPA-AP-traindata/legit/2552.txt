UNITY PARTY: DONALD TRUMP and PAUL RYAN will meet next week, the two sides announced on Friday, just a day after Ryan, the House Speaker, said he couldn't yet back his party's presumptive nominee for president. 
Ryan's office said he invited Trump to meet with him and other members of House Republican leadership and that they will get together on Thursday in Washington. Separately, Ryan and Trump will also meet with Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, POLITICO's Rachael Bade reports.  
Ryan's office pegged it as an opportunity for unity. But Trump on Friday appeared to still be stinging from Ryan's initial rejection. "He's doing it under the banner of unity, when in actuality that's the opposite of unity," Trump said of Ryan. "I've also had many people say that I'm better off, but I don't believe that. I think we should have unity. I think it would be better to have him. But it's just too bad. Many people think I'm better off. Who knows?"

Here are four more things we're watching today. 
2) G(MEN) CHAT: The FBI has talked to top HILLARY CLINTON aides about her email and private server, POLITICO's Josh Gerstein reports, including top aide Huma Abedin. The news was first reported by CNN on Thursday. The investigation is, if nothing else, a continued distraction for Clinton's campaign and a bogeyman for Republicans. <<link>> CBS reported Friday that Clinton herself was set to talk to be interviewed by the FBI. <<link>> Clinton's campaign had no comment on either report other than to say, "From the start, Hillary Clinton has offered to answer any questions that would help the Justice Department complete
its review, and we hope and expect that anyone else who is asked would do the same," campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said. "We are confident the review will conclude that nothing inappropriate took place."
3) RYAN REVERB: Even as PAUL RYAN and DONALD TRUMP announced they would meet next week, the reverb from Ryan's comments continued: Trump seemed to suggest that Ryan was not fit to be Speaker <<link>> Ryan found backing from 2012 GOP nominee MITT ROMNEY, who also said he would not support Trump. <<link>> Sean Hannity accused Ryan of leading a "circular firing squad." <<link>> Ryan's primary opponent also said he would back Trump. <<link>> And on it went: JEB BUSH said he wouldn't vote for DONALD TRUMP either. 
<<link>> 
BLAST NOTE: Want to know how all this started? POLITICO's Jake Sherman has a fascinating tick-tock on how Ryan came to his decision. <<link>> 
4) MAY DAZE: BERNIE SANDERS is poised for a big May, posing a nuisance to HILLARY CLINTON even if she's still on track to march to the Democratic nomination. POLITICO's Daniel Strauss reports the calendar tilts in Sanders' favor, starting with West Virginia, which votes on May 10. <<link>> The likely victories are part of Sanders' reason for staying the race. And he's fighting for his spot: He also accused the Democratic National Committee of stacking the Philadelphia convention in Clinton's favor by appointing Clinton loyalists to key committee seats. <<link>> Meanwhile, both sides prepare to scrap for delegates on
Saturday in Guam, which has a caucus. 
5)   BENGHAZI A LONG TIME: Rep. Trey Gowdy, whose House Select Committee on Benghazi could yet provide political fodder against HILLARY CLINTON, blames the Obama administration for dragging out the committee's work. In an interview with POLITICO's Rachael Bade, Gowdy said it is not a matter of Congressional Republicans wanting to drag the investigation into November's election. "It's taken way too long and way too much of our energy in simply gaining access," Gowdy said. "There continues to be time wasted negotiating with executive branch entities who do not want to give us what I believe Congress is entitled to." <<link>> 
TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Reince Priebus is pretty sure. HILLARY CLINTON is looking for Rangers. BERNIE SANDERS could mount a floor fight and Wisconsin may be a November battleground. CHRIS CHRISTIE gets a hand.
