Hi Gabi - we do loose quite a bit (e.g., boreholes and other proxies) 
back beyond 500, so that's why we drew the "very likely" line there. 
But, we did stay as strong as the TAR back 1300, so that was our 
compromise on certainty. I believe the forcing series also start to 
get more uncertain pretty fast back beyond even 400 years ago, but 
I'm pretty impressed with the match between simulated and observed NH 
climate back ca. 700 years (e.g., our Figs 6.13 and 6.14). Thus, I 
bet you are right that we know back to 700 pretty well, but not well 
enough to go with "very likely" in the all important chap 6 bullet.
Not sure this helps, but we do need to pay attention as we do the SPM 
to get the right balance.
I'll cc to Keith in case he wants to chime in, which would be appreciated.
thanks, peck
