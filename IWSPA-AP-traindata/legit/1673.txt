Friend,
I wanted to make sure you didn’t miss this message from Perry. We are fortunate to have the right and privilege to vote in this country. It is a right that has been guaranteed by patriots going back to the Founding Fathers.
But politicians in Tallahassee do not want people to vote. Rick Scott and Pam Bondi want to manipulate the system so that they can win elections. It’s wrong and we shouldn’t let them get away with it. We can’t wait until September and October. We need to make sure we have a fair election NOW.
Sign our petition to expand early voting TODAY!
Best,
Zachary Meunier
P.S. And seriously, read Perry’s e-mail below if you haven’t. His commitment to elections where all citizens can participate, regardless of age, income, race, or sexual orientation, is second to none. Then sign our petition: <<link>>
