I still believe you are not showing sufficient comparisons with  series
besides the MBH ; necessary to demonstrate the true extent of "new" information in this
work. At the very least this needs to acknowledge that other (and other tree-ring-based )
series are out there , that use at least some of the data you employ , and use the RCS
method to process may of their constituent series - i.e. the Northern chronology series
shown in my QSR paper. What is similar and what is different in your series and this one?
You give the impression here that you are using the RCS and new data to demonstrate the
possibility of getting more low frequency signal from tree-ring data - but then you base
this on a comparison with MBH only. Surely what is needed here is to establish WHY MBH
don't get as much LIA for example . By not showing that other tree-ring data that have also
shown a LIA , and not exploring why MBH does not (despite using some of the same -and note
-already RCS standardised data) is perhaps confusing rather than clarifying the issue.
When we discussed this here, I also suggested the need to show  separate "north" and more
"south" curves ,separated in your data set, to try to get at least some handle on the
independent expression of the centennial trends in a region south of the over-exploited
northern network . At the very least it should be clearly stated that many of the site data
used here and in previous work (see our Science perspectives piece) are common and other
series already produce more low-frequency signal than is implied in MBH .
Sorry for this rushed comment but I wanted to get this point over as we had talked about it
before but you don't seem to have taken it on board.
cheers
