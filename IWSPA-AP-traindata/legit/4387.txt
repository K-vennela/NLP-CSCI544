1. Trump knows he continues to have a serious base problem and must reassur=

2. Harriet Miers may not be on this list, but several of these guys, charit=
ably, could not be described as intellectual heavyweights in the mold of th=
e late Antonin Scalia. Still, Trump=E2=80=99s announcement takes a lot of p=
ressure off both Chuck Grassley and Mitch McConnell to move on Merrick Garl=
and before the lame duck.
The uncertainty over who Trump might pick=E2=80=93at one point, he floated =
his sister=E2=80=94has prompted some legal luminaries to privately encourag=
e the Senate Majority Leader to back off his refusal to give Obama nominee =
Merrick Garland a hearing. The thinking is two-fold: First, Trump will prob=
ably lose to Hillary Clinton. Second, Obama could withdraw the moderate Gar=
land after the election so that President-elect Clinton would get to appoin=
t a vastly more liberal (and younger) alternative.
Now McConnell and Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, can po=
int to Trump=E2=80=99s list as a reason to stand firm.
Grassley yesterday put out a statement praising Trump for =E2=80=9Can impre=
ssive list of highly qualified jurists.=E2=80=9D (Perhaps to pander to Gras=
sley, one is from Iowa!)
The influential Judicial Crisis Network, which has spent $4 million on ads =
opposing Garland, gave them additional cover to do so. Carrie Severino, who=
runs the group, said she likes all 11 judges.
3. Trump cares little about diversity. Every person is white. Eight of the =
11 are men.

4. In the tight-knit world of the Supreme Court bar, several of Trump=E2=80=
=99s picks (like Trump) are outsiders. Only six of Trump=E2=80=99s favored =
judges currently sit on the federal bench. The other five are on state Supr=
eme Courts. This means they have never been vetted by the pros on the Senat=
e Judiciary Committee.
Every justice currently on the court studied law at Harvard or Yale. No one=
on Trump=E2=80=99s list went to Harvard, and only one attended Yale. Supre=
me Court beat reporter Robert Barnes and Trump beat reporter Jenna Johnson =
note that these jurists attended non-Ivies, such as Tulane and the Universi=

In fact, for the experts who live and breathe this stuff, there are a few p=
retty random names on the list. John Hinderaker, who was a very influential=
lawyer in Minnesota, is a well-known figure in the conservative movement b=

c1C15bb32f8>: =E2=80=9COne of the judges on the list, David Stras, is on th=
e Minnesota Supreme Court. He has stellar credentials, having clerked for M=
ichael Luttig and Clarence Thomas. Prior to his appointment to the Minnesot=

5. The list is most telling for who is not on it.
I=E2=80=99ve written before about how leading conservatives were pushing Tr=
ump to include Utah Sen. Mike Lee on the list. But Lee, who supported Ted C=
ruz in the primaries, said just last week that the presumptive GOP nominee =
=E2=80=9Cscares me to death.=E2=80=9D He has not committed to support him, =
so maybe it shouldn=E2=80=99t be surprising to see him (and Cruz, for that =

=C2=A0Lee=E2=80=99s brother Thomas=E2=80=94a Utah Supreme Court Justice=E2=
=80=94appears.
Paul Clement, the young former Solicitor General under George W. Bush, was =
on the Heritage Foundation=E2=80=99s wish list. But the former Scalia clerk=
got snubbed. Perhaps it is because Trump hates the Bushes and ran so hard =
against them in the primaries.

6. Trump=E2=80=99s uncharacteristically nuanced announcement should alarm c=

Big picture, only someone who is na=C3=AFve would trust Trump to follow thr=
ough on all or even most of his campaign promises. Anyone who understands h=
ow government works recognizes that much of what he espouses is either infe=
asible and probably not what he really believes.
This scares the bejesus out of smart movement conservatives, who believe Tr=
ump has not demonstrated that he has a moral compass and that he lacks core=
principles to guide him on the issues. He flippantly flip-flops and refuse=
s to apologize. He used to support abortion, for instance. What=E2=80=99s t=
