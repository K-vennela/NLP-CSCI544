Racial greetings, my brother! I'll be waiting for the info I requested
before I decide to join or not. You said to email you with any questions
though, and so here goes...
What seperates the storm trooper branch of the NSM from the rest? That's
what I'm interested in at this point because I like the suit and would get
to wear it proudly. Of course, a suit isn't why I would join, but it does
sound like a bit more up my alley.88
In Blood And Honor,
