Thanks for your reply.   I have removed the 
'since 1950' from the TS.   That was taken from 
your ES but in view of this discussion I think 
the reader needs to go to the chapter.
Please note that 'Since 1950' is not (and never 
was) in the SPM, so there is no interplay at all 
between the issues being discussed in this series 
of emails and anything that occurred in Paris or 
prior to Paris.
It was, of course, for you to decide what you 
wanted in your ES and how to mesh that with the 
main text of your chapter.  It is entirely a 
'within chapter' issue.
best regards,
Susan
