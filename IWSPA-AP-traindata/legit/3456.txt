Dear all
Jacquie had sounded very positive about this back in August, but it sounds like CSERGE are
as stretched as much as people in CRU.
I'm afraid it's looking like we're not going to be able to get anything together on this
unless Rob is able to take a lead. But I think that we would still be lacking the
interdisciplinary research team that AXA are stressing.

PS Rob - sorry not to have been in touch with you sooner about this, but I didn't know
until Tuesday that you were interested/had been approached.

Hi Clare I dont think weve got the capacity to take this on at this stage.  Never mind
there will always be other opportunities.
Best wishes
