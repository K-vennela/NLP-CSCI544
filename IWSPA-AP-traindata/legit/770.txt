I hope all of you have long arms. We're reaching all
the way to Australia for this one.

You should get the "YourSay" page from the
Courier-Mail. To send your letter, you have to click
on "letter to the editor" which you'll find in blue
text on a light blue horizontal line towards the top
of the screen.
They have some rules on the website:
"Letter must be short and may be edited. All letters
to be considered for publication must have a name,
street address and phone number so their authenticity
can be checked."
Now, if you don't live in Australia, and you don't
want to take a chance on somebody with a funny accent
calling you in the middle of the night to see if you
really wrote that letter, I advise you to leave off
the phone number.
You can write whatever you want in the letter but I
suggest that you forward the truth about the fact that
none of these psych "disorders" are scientifically
proven to exist in anybody.
And report compliance by email.
Your Mate,
Doyle
