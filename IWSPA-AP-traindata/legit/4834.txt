Mr. Herring,
I recently officially joined NSM, apparently anyways, haha. I =
sent in my lifetime membership application about three weeks ago. My initia=
l payment of $300 has been taken out of my account, but i have not received=
an email or any letter mail confirming my formal admission or anything of =
the sort.=20
=20
I would appreciate anything that could be sent to me or someth=
ing that needs to be done or worked on. I would also like some sort of pape=
r or really anything that would confirm my admission into NSM. I'm not sure=
if the movement has anything of the sort, but if it doesn't maybe its some=
thing that could be worked on. I don't have too much time on my hands while=
i am deployed, but the free time that I do have, I would prefer to devote =
to the movement. Give me something to do! haha. If you are the wrong person=
to be contactiong about this please accept my apology and point me in the =
right direction.
