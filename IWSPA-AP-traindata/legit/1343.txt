Thank you, how can I become a member? I am a Disabled veteran of the U.S Marine Corps, there is not a NSM Unit in my state.How can I get more involved?

I do not have the information directly in front of me, (as we are growing so quickly) but if you wish to find the NSM unit closest to you, go to our main website at www.nsm88.com and scroll down the left hand side of the screen until you see the box 'Units and Contacts". There you will find a complete listing of all NSM units in every state and country with contact information. All unit leaders are chosen for their dependability and loyalty and anyone you speak with will be able to assist you with information about our organization or any questions you may have. 88!
Sincerely,
NSM Staff Corps
