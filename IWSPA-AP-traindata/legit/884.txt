Hi Caspar and Gene - Thanks. I look forward to hearing how things go 
- if the paper is in press by the first week of August, we'll cite it 
in the Chapter 6 of the FOD, but otherwise I guess it'll have to wait 
- that's ok too.
But... keep us posted (and send revised preprint when possible). Thanks! Peck
