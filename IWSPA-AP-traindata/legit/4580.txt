Thanks Kevin,
Those are helpful--Tom C. has returned from travels and will be providing comments shortly.
Will incorporate those and any others I receive into a revised version, which I hope to
send out (w/ Figure 1 included) tonight or tomorrow,
mike
p.s. Tom W is taking the lead on preparing a companion, more targeted commentary, to be
submitted to "Climate Research".  Any one else interested  should contact Tom...
