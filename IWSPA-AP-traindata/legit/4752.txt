I do not recall what Kyrdianov has worked on - sorry. However, Hantemirov has done outstanding work putting together and as yet preliminarily analysing what wii no doubt become a world famous sub fossil chronology in the Yamal area of northern Siberia. Indeed I will feature this work in my presentation.
Frank , an important point requiring your instant help! Some time ago I got a request to write something for a NERC(?) publication related to my talk in April. Now I can't find it and desperately need to contact the guy about length and deadine - which may have passed. Can you help? I know you coordinated with him.
Yes I know I'm a _anker!
