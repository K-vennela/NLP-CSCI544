NSM Responds:
*National Socialist Movement:  "Vandalism Always Sends Wrong Message"
*
For Immediate Release
Detroit, MI.  04 February.  The National Socialist Movement (NSM) responded
today to reported vandalism of Chicago's Westlawn cemetery by an alleged NSM
member.  "We have read the reports in the papers, "said a spokesman, "and we
never support vandalism of any kind.  The National Socialist Movement works
to build a prosperous, peaceful future for white America. And while we
certainly understand anger over jewish owned media and monetary control,
vandalism of any kind only serves the interests of our enemies."
The NSM and other white political/activist groups are increasingly targets
of false vandalism claims instigated by jewish-sympathizers or other
individuals simply seeking media attention.  "We emphasize to all members of
the NSM that we follow all state and federal laws," the NSM spokesman said.
"Unfortunately," he continued, "we are often portrayed as dangerous or
intimidating in an attempt to keep people away from our message of hope and
prosperity."
About the NSM
The NSM, America's Nazi Party, is the largest and most active National
Socialist movement in America. The NSM's core beliefs include: defending the
rights of white people everywhere, preservation of our European culture and
heritage, strengthening family values, economic self-sufficiency, reform of
illegal immigration policies, immediate withdrawal of our national military
from an illegal Middle Eastern occupation and promotion of white separation.
