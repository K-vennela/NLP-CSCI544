Nick,
Apologies if I've asked you this before, but I'm being asked about
the ECOCHANGE budget that appears to be available to UEA.
With the UEA budget there is money in categories that UEA has not
had money in before (in other EU projects). Do you know what this money
is supposed to be for?  We understand the budget for personnel and also
travel, but it is the other categories - which seem to relate to more travel
and costs for capital equipment.
Keith is still off work, but is recovering well from his operation.
I'm off in the next few hours for 2 weeks away.
Cheers
Phil
