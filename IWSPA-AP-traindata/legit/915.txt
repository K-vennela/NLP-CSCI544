They gave us that weekend b/c the surrogate coordinator got an ask from the Prince Edwards County Democratic Party for her time for a fundraiser in Farmsville to raise for the VP debate in October. We were trying to build in events around it.
I've talked to Hillary's team, Terry's team and the DPVA (they're trying to do an event in Richmond) and they all say that competing with Kaine that weekend is going to be tricky. DPVA has been searching for hosts in Richmond and is having the same issue.
I talked to Clay and he said he was happy to put feelers out in Nebraska and see if he could do something there.
Scott, Ron Allen, and I are going to meet with Kate at 3:30 to go over everything.
Sorry-I'm not trying to sound negative or off load work; I would LOVE to do a VA swing but I think it would be better to have it host driven and build from there.
