Thank you for your generous offer. We will almost certainly have transporta=
tion issues to and from our rally. Understandably, these functions end up c=
osting a substantial amount, and so we must carefully budget each of these =
events. Are you offering your services for free, or will there be a fee inv=
olved? If so, please send us a quote so that we may plan accordingly and de=
cide if this will fit onto our budgeted itinerary. Again, thank you for you=
r offer. We hope that you and your comrades will be able to make it to our =
demonstration and support us in our endeavour to save this country.        =
