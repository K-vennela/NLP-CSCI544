Connecticut
Polls open across the state for Connecticut Primary Day
The polls have opened across the state for Connecticut Primary Day. All qu=
iet so far=2C but this is kind of new territory for Connecticut. Usually b=
y the time out primary rolls around the nominees are all sewn up. Not the=
case this year. In fact=2C presidential primary days are usually so quiet=
in Connecticut that the schools where voting happens stay open=2C and sin=
e the crowds aren=E2=80=99t that big=2C there are few concerns about that.=
But this year=2C we are looking at a substantial turnout. That means in t=
owns like Branford=2C you=E2=80=99re going to have crowds of people coming=
to schools that are in session. That has some parents concerned about sec=
urity issues. The spokesman for the Branford police=2C however=2C says the=
y=E2=80=99re on top it=2C and everything should be fine. =E2=80=9CWe have=
not gotten any type of information that there=E2=80=99s going to be any t=
ype of security concerns at any of the polling places. However=2C a couple=
of our polling places reside in schools. School will be in session=2C so=
we=E2=80=99ll handle that
accordingly=2C=E2=80=9D said Capt. Geoff Morgan=2C Branford Police Dept.

Delaware
Decision time for Delaware voters
Polls opened at 7 a.m. Tuesday for the Delaware primary=2C when the state=
could play a critical role in who advances to the general election in Nov=
ember. Tuesday's contests offer 384 delegates=2C who will be divided propo=
rtionally based on the outcome. Hillary Clinton has a lead of more than 20=
0 delegates won in primaries and caucuses. Including superdelegates=2C Cli=
nton's lead stands at 1=2C944 to 1=2C192 for challenger Bernie Sanders=2C=
according to an Associated Press count. That means she has 82 percent of=
the 2=2C383 delegates needed to win the nomination. Clinton has the chanc=
e of a clean sweep or at least multiple victories Tuesday that would proba=
bly foreclose Sanders' already narrow path to the nomination. But the Verm=
ont senator's campaign manager=2C Jeff Weaver=2C said the millions of doll=
ars flowing to Sanders and the boisterous rallies show that his "supporter=
s will stand with us all the way to the end."  Asked whether he expects a=
contested national Democratic convention=2C Weaver
told reporters in Connecticut=2C "Absolutely=2C 100 percent." Weaver said=
=2C "This is a powerful movement he's built and we're going to take it to=
the convention.=E2=80=9D <<link>>

This year it matters. Late states Pennsylvania=2C Connecticut=2C Delaware=
=2C Maryland and Rhode Island aren=E2=80=99t often decisive=2C or even rel=
