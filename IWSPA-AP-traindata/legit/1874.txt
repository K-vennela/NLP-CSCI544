Neville,
Mike's response could do with a little work, but as you say he's got the tone
almost dead on.  I hope I don't get a call from congress !  I'm hoping that no-one
there realizes I have a US DoE grant and have had this (with Tom W.) for the last 25
years.
I'll send on one other email received for interest.
Cheers
Phil
