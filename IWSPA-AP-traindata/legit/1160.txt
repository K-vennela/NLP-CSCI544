Supreme Court
*         In March, the President fulfilled his constitutional responsibili=
ty by nominating Chief Judge Merrick Garland - an eminently qualified Ameri=
can - to the Supreme Court.
*         Today, in addition to continuing to meet with senators of both pa=
rties, Chief Judge Garland will submit his questionnaire to the Senate Judi=
ciary Committee.
*         The questionnaire and associated materials present an exhaustive =
picture of Judge Garland's distinguished career and impeccable credentials =
as a nominee to the Supreme Court.
*         The President expects that upon receiving the questionnaire, Sena=
te Judiciary Committee members will do their jobs by reviewing the informat=
ion, noticing a hearing so that the American people can hear directly from =
Chief Judge Garland as he answers questions under oath, and giving him a fa=
ir up or down vote.
*         Every nominee since 1875 who wasn't withdrawn from consideration =
has received a hearing and or a vote.

t nominee in history and a long record of public service, we expect the Sen=
ate will give Chief Judge Garland the same fair consideration as prior nomi=
nees.

d quickly move to consider the President's nominee.

can people expect and deserve from their leaders.
*         Presidents do not stop working in the final year of their term. A=
nd it's becoming clear that many Republican senators realize they shouldn't=
either.
