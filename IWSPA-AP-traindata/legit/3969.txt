Mike
your words are a real boost to me at the moment. I found myself questioning the whole
process and being often frustrated at the formulaic way things had to be done - often
wasting time and going down dead ends. I really thank you for taking the time to say these
kind words . I tried hard to balance the needs of the science and the IPCC , which were not
always the same. I worried that you might think I gave the impression of not supporting you
well enough while trying to report on the issues and uncertainties . Much had to be removed
and I was particularly unhappy that I could not get the statement into the SPM regarding
the AR4 reinforcement of the results and conclusions of the TAR. I tried my best but we
were basically railroaded by Susan. I am happy to pass the mantle on to someone else next
time. I feel I have basically produced nothing original or substantive of my own since this
whole process started. I am at this moment , having to work on the ENV submission to the
forthcoming UK Research Assessment exercise , again instead of actually doing some useful
research ! Anyway thanks again Mike.... really appreciated when it comes from you
very best wishes
