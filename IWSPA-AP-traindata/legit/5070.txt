Tom,
Good idea with that BAMS paper. There is also the KNMI web site,
which tells that they have restricted data from Europe - on the ECA part.
Both despite WMO-Res40!
On IPCC, I suggested Thomas to not get too many hangers on amongst the LAs.
Chs 2 and 14 are prime candidates for upping the geographic spread. We had
about half of ours not doing that much last time.
Isn't Tom Karl on the US nominating committee?
Away all day tomorrow - CRU barbecue - so will pour down.
Cheers
Phil
