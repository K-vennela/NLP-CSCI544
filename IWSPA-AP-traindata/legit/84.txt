Chris et al,
I'll sedn some more thoughts on Thursday when back from
the EGU. It is too hot in Vienna to sit through too many
talks !
I suspect we need a subset of indices. The program will
calculate all those recommended in various programs. One
possibility is to keep them all and let users decide.
We do need to make a series of checks though at some
stage to make sure they are OK.
I think you'll have some fruitful discussions on
some of these on April 24. I hope you can come to
closure on a few things.
Cheers
Phil
