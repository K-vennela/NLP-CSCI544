ll+ever+need>  - eleven bucks! - new edition just out today.  (A great
graduation gift. Buy three!)
2.       On page 249, I show how much better investors do under Democrats -
as I do here
<<<link>>> :
$41,380 vs $575,324!  
Forward THAT to your "moderate Republican" friends.  If they have even an
ounce of greed in their bodies, they'll vote our way.
Thanks, as always.

PS - We really really need your help funding the core functions on which all
our candidates rely - the tech platform, the 180-million name voter file,
the $7,500 we send your state party and 49 others each month, the Convention
everyone assumes we will hold and televise 12 weeks from now but don't yet
have the money to do.  I need 1% of your net worth, or as close to that as
you can come.  Like a lobster claw, it will grow back in a few months - but
you'll have saved the Court for the next 30 years, and possibly the
habitability of the planet (currently the only one available to us).  Click
here <<<link>>> .  We will credit
it to any upcoming DNC events you want to attend.
