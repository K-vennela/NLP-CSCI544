Given the fact that I have access only to DoD computers, the opportunities =
for me to get on the NSM website are severely limited. I was kind of just l=
ooking for an update on things as of late; how the march went, anything I c=
an help with, etc.

Its looking like I will be returning home sometime this fall/winter.

As I've said in previous emails, I really would like something to do for no=
w. The only reason that I am addressing these emails to you is because this=
is pretty much the only email address I have, haha. If there is somewhere =
else that I should be sending my emails, please let me know.=20

Something I had a question on, is there any sort of form or certificate pro=
ving my lifetime membership in NSM? I kind of just want it for a keepsake t=
o frame or something for my office. Just wondering.=20

And also, please let me know how the march went, as I cannot access the web=
site from my current location.
