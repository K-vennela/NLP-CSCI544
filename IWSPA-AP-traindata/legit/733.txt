Gentlemen,
I've combined everything (I hope!) into the latest revision.  I've probably made some
glaring mistake somewhere, so read it critically.
It's also necessary to ensure that it all fits together coherently, and that anything we
claim we'll do is actually done.  I want this to be airtight, let's not leave them any
"wiggle room."
Referring to the inappropriate application of filters, I have a feeling that saying
"perhaps not an uncommon error" is too easy on them.  I have no motivation to go easy on
them.  Perhaps I'm being too aggressive; I defer to the majority opinion.
On a few technical details, I need altaffils and authoraddresses for everybody.  And make
sure I've got your name right!
Sincerely,
Grant
