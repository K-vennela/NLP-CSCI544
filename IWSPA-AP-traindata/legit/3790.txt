Indicted Democratic Rep. Chaka Fattah lost a four-way primary to state Rep. Dwight Evans Tuesday, making Fattah the first House member of 2016 to lose his seat.
Evans had 43 percent of the vote to 36 percent for Fattah, with 88 percent of precincts reporting, when the Associated Press called the race. Two other candidates split the remainder of the vote. (See results here.)
