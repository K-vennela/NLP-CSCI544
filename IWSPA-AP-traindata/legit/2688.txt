Tim, we are getting close but there are a few items to discuss:
1) seven of the eight time series are from the Hegerl et al paper, now 
out for review in Nature
2) the eighth time series is from Brian Luckmans recent extension of the 
Alberta record to the 10th century - we used his original time series in 
the H et al paper because the comparisons between model and observations 
had been going on for a while, in fact before the new Luckman paper came 
out, and we did not want to switch horses in midstream by changing the 
composite - as you know the Luckman paper is either accepted or 
published in CD, so there is no problem changing that
3) although technically the time series are not the same they are very 
close, if you want me to do some comparisons I can, but I could not get 
to it until probably tuesday of next week - I don't particularly see any 
problem in makng such an addition
4) we cannot extend the time series back to 800 without dropping out 
something - the reason we start at 945 is that is the first year when 
all the records are available - if we go back to 800 we do so at the 
cost of dropping 2 or possibly even 3 records.  as our Dark Ages 
reconstruction starting at 560 indicates (att.), the biggest warming 
between 800-1900 is in the late 10the century (960-995), we did not 
think we missing out on anything by starting at 945 rather than 800.
I await your feedback on this increasingly intricate issue, tom
