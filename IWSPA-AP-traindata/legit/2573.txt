Comrades and Fellow Party members,
As most of you know NSM Records has recently relocated from
Minneapolis to Detroit. The relocation of the Record Label has went well,
and all orders will be caught up within a week.
NSM HQ is also in the process of relocation. Mail is still being accepted at
the NSM HQ address in Minneapolis, however all new inquiries should go to
our new address in Michigan.
NSM HQ P.o. box 13768 Detroit, MI. 48213
