Questions Raised On Teen Screening
Mar 19, 2006
Program Poses Dangers
Regarding "Local Schools Lack Screening" by Donna
Koehn (Nation/World,
March 12):
Implementation of screening programs such as
TeenScreen has not been
proven to prevent suicide, although they potentially
bring many more
customers to the mental health industry.
There is a considerable discrepancy within the mental
health
professions as to the precise definition of "mental
illness,"
appropriate diagnostic means to determine whether a
person suffers from
such "mental illness" and appropriate and effective
means to treat such
"mental illness."
Assuming that a "screening" program identifies
students who suffer
"mental illness," what would school officials
recommend? Would they
only make "recommendations" and "referrals" or would
that become
"requirements"? If parents reject "recommendations" or
"referrals,"
what penalties would the parents and their children
incur?
Additionally, what happens to sensitive information
that is collected?
Who is allowed access and what will be done with it?
These questions alone point to the dangers of
implementing these
programs.

Schools Aren't Clinics
Put aside the questionable efficacy of this program.
Every parent is
mandated on all levels to do what they believe is
right for their
children, but to implement a psychological program
utilizing school
personnel, school time - and my tax dollars - makes no
sense. These are
educational institutions, not clinics.

Just A Big Moneymaker
I read the "Local Schools Lack Screening" article by
Donna Koehn and
the facts in the article ignore what I know of
TeenScreen.
TeenScreen works primarily as a "financial feeder
line" for the
pharmaceutical companies and psychiatrists. It helps
promote the
psychotropic drugs that everyone knows are
over-prescribed and now
black-box labeled as dangerous.
You need someone who can dig a little deeper into the
real truth behind
this important issue before allowing such an article
to be published.

Just Look At The Facts
School-based depression screening should not be judged
on what
Scientology has to say about it. Judge it for
yourself. Ask why there
is such a push to put it in public schools when
statistics from the CDC
prove that teen suicide is on the decline. Look at the
facts of teen
suicide reported daily in the paper and you will see
that in most cases
of a teen committing suicide in America, that person
was already on
psychiatric drugs, usually an antidepressant.
