Hey there,
Hoyer's folks have set aside two possible dates for a DNC fundraiser-June 21st at 7pm and June 23rd at 5:30 pm.
They need an answer ASAP on which date we want and I was wondering if either of you knew of any conflicts on those days that would impact the event. And Scott-I was wondering if DWS' schedule would allow her to attend.
Thanks!
