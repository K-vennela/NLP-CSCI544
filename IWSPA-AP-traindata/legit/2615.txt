1. Hundreds (Possibly Thousands) of New Templates and
Examples
Our Continuous Improvement (hence the "CI") campaign has
added hundreds of new templates and examples over the
past few months. If you didn't find what you're looking for before, we encourage you to check us out again.
We've also expanded the categories of diagrams and made
it easier to navigate to the area you want. Some of
the newer ones include: Lean Diagrams, Health Care,
Legal & Government, Network Design, Web Design, and more.
2. Action Buttons
Action buttons allow you to simply click and add a shape
in any direction. 
Making flowcharts, org charts, value stream maps and
other diagrams is now faster and easier than ever.
3. Compact Formatting
Keep your org charts, mind maps and other diagrams
looking neat and tidy with compact formatting. Simply
select the Use Compact Formatting check-box and your
org chart will completely realign itself in a symmetrically
balanced format.
4. Automated Floor Plan Drawing
Having to futz around trying to manually draw walls and
get them to square up is a thing of the past. Now, simply
click open a room template, type in your dimensions, and
SmartDraw does the rest. Add a wall and snap it into place.
Easy!
5. New CAD & Engineering Tools
SmartDraw CI has many of the features you find in CAD programs
costing thousands of dollars. It's so accurate you can create
blueprint-ready drawings in builder's scale.
You'll find new and enhanced design categories and greater
user control. Simply click to change scale or turn of
SmartDraw's automated snaps feature.
6.	Manage Larger Projects
Load up your Gantt chart with a thousand or more tasks.
SmartDraw gives you increased speed, smoother switching
between views, and improved reliability. Integrate easily
with Microsoft Project® and Office®. 
7. Create Infographics 
You don't need artistic skill or an in-house graphics
designer to make a powerful, great-looking infographic.
SmartDraw gives you the templates and tools you need to do
it yourself and impress your audience.
8.	Smart Charts Let You Click to Access Data
Let your charts be gateways to other data: hyperlink to
web pages, open an Excel® table, or even link to
other SmartDraw charts. Any data point on a SmartDraw
chart can be a gateway to other information with just a click.
9. New Lean Method Templates 
The Lean Method is familiar to a growing number of
companies. Its concepts drive product/service improvements
and customer experience with focus on a long-term view.
These visuals are included in SmartDraw CI:
PDCA Cycle
Kanban Board
Value Stream Map
Process Map
A3 Thinking
Fishbone (Ishikawa, Cause-and-Effect)
Tree Diagram
Spaghetti Diagram 5 S
5Ws

Logs
10. Convert & Import Visio® Files
SmartDraw will import a single Visio file or let you convert
an entire batch of files.
And you don't need to have a copy of Visio—SmartDraw will
complete the conversion for you.
Plus, you can easily view and share your flowcharts and
other diagrams online with your SmartDraw Premium Account. 
Access them from your phone or tablet anytime, anywhere.
