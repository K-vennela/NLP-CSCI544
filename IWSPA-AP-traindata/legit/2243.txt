Dear Hugues,
I agree and what Damien said echoes what Keith is concerned about. We need to expand the
timescale of Millennium AND focus much more on sensitivity and predictability.

Hi Eystein,
Thanks a lot for the information.  I agree with you that it is very important that the
topic "Earth system dynamics: Palaeoenvironmental analysis" includes explicetly our area
of interest. By the way, I have briefly discussed with Damien Cardinal after the meeting
yesterday. He tolds me that the EU has already funded recently a very big project over
the last Millenium, so they will be reluctant to make a new call covering this subject
but we can certainly sell our science in something more general like 'natural
variability and climate  predictability'.
All the best
Hugues

Hi Keith and  Hugues,
Here are two documents re. our discussion of FP7 topics.
As you will see the plan is to have the following topic out in 2008
or later: ·
Earth system dynamics: Palaeoenvironmental analysis
I think it will be important that the topic really comes in 2008 and
that it includes the terms natural variability and climate
predictability when it is described in the call. If possible our
national program committee members should be contacted to propose
this. As far as I know there will be a meeting later this spring to
discuss the next calls.
Cheers
Eystein
