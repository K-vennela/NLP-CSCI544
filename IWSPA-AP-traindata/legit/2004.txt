Hi Tim - Thanks. If you don't mind, let's see 
what the new grey in panel c,  and also the 5-95% 
range on a. Also, another alternative to the grey 
and red could be some other color that is just 
less bright - perhaps blue?
Agree there is no reason to switch the reviewed 
panel c uncertainty approach. It argues a bit 
that we leave panel a as is too. I'm unsure what 
is best, so maybe see what Keith thinks too - and 
discuss more with Phil - he is right that most 
are trying to go with 5-95 where possible.
Thanks again.
