Ben,
I will be at Duke. Get to the airport about 6.30pm on the 29th. Looking forward to
seeing you there.
I should have signed off on the CCSP report by Easter. We have to get everything
done by March 28. We had a conf. call last Friday.
I can see the argument about an assessment and 'new information'. It is a similar
thing in IPCC. Glad to hear you're going to submit it for a paper, because I think it
is important. It will unlikely change some peoples views, though.
Just had a long call with Chris Folland. He says that the next CCSP vtt meeting is
going to be scheduled for Chicago for the week we should be doing the HC review !
Hope you're still going to come to Exeter. You should have less to do than all the
other chapters !
See you on the 29th late or more likely for breakfast on the 30th.
Cheers
Phil
