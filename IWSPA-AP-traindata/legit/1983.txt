Hello all:
Here is a slightly revised update of the Wahl-Ammann final submission to Climatic Change.  It is entirely unaltered in substance, design, methods, results, and conclusions.
The alterations are concentrated in Appendix 1 (the entire rest if the text is unaffected except for three words on p. 17)--focused on eliminating a small gap in logic in our description of the performance of the CE statistic (and to streamline the statements about the sign test and the product means test). 
Stephen Schneider has these corrections and is still reviewing the manuscript.
Please replace the version sent earlier this week with this one.
Peace, Gene
