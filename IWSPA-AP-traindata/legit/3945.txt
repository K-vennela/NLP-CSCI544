They published the last article in their series today.
Predictably it's a money grab for more psych programs.
I need everyone to write a letter on this one as soon
as you read this, especially those who did not write
to Deseret News earlier this week.
Here's the article (text at bottom):

Send your letter to user@domain.com. If your last
name ends in A-C, J-M or T-U, send copies to
user@domain.com and user@domain.com.
Write whatever you want but I suggest attacking the
fact that this is just a blatant money grab, that
there is no science proving that any of these psych
solutions prevent suicide, and that talking about it
may cause suicide. Also you can bring in the matter of
the drugs - if someone is identified and referred for
help they are going to get a drug that is labeled by
the FDA for its tendency to CAUSE suicide.
If you want to, attack the fact that NAMI, funded to
the tune of millions by drug companies, is featured
prominently in the article.
I'm counting on you to pile lots of letters on their
desks today!
Best,
Doyle
