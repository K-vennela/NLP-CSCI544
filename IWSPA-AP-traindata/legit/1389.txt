James Hohmann is on vacation -- we'll have a series of guest writers from t=
he Post political team sharing their analysis with you this week.
=E2=80=9CPlease hold for Mr. Trump.=E2=80=9D
Following Donald Trump=E2=80=99s commanding sweep of the Indiana primary, t=
hose words have been heard across the media landscape this week by countles=
s producers and reporters as the presumptive Republican nominee has made th=
e rounds on television, radio, and print =E2=80=94 and then made the rounds=
again. He has been everywhere, often seen sitting with his eyes narrowed a=
cross from a cable host, at other times just a voice.
But the saturation has been more than a victory tour for Trump. It is=C2=A0=
indicative of how he plans to approach the general-election campaign. Inste=
ad of relying on traditional methods of communication =E2=80=94 paid advert=
ising, carefully-chosen interviews, corporate-crafted Facebook posts =E2=80=
=94 he will be the medium and the message, unpredictable and always around.
Trump=E2=80=99s daily routine: hundreds of requests come in through his tru=
sted press aide, Hope Hicks, and they get piled on his desk. (Trump likes t=
o review actual printed documents.) He rifles through them =E2=80=94 confir=
ming this, nixing that. But that isn=E2=80=99t the end. He keeps close watc=
h on=C2=A0cable news, he monitors the headlines (which are also printed out=
). He=E2=80=99ll call into one network while another sets up backstage. And=
eventually he turns to Twitter, typing himself or dictating to an associat=
e.
For Democrats and Republicans, the obvious consequence of Trump=E2=80=99s u=
biquity is that regardless of what they want to focus on, they will likely =
be forced to respond each day to the mogul=E2=80=99s latest whim. He looms =
each hour as a constant potential disturbance, for better or for worse.
And shock he did on Thursday when he generated a torrent of commentary =E2=
=80=94 much of it cringing and harshly critical =E2=80=94 with a controvers=
ial tweet that showed him smiling widely as he ate a taco bowl and praised =
Hispanics.

To get a sense of why Trump is following an unusual playbook all his own, T=
he Washington Post spoke with longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone, a Nixon=
-loving bon vivant and ruthless strategist who has been at the billionaire=
=E2=80=99s side for decades (although he is not part of Trump=E2=80=99s cam=
paign).
Stone said that Trump=E2=80=99s manner, forged in the Manhattan tabloid and=
business wars of the 1980s, could weather more blows and brushbacks than t=
he typical national politician and thus made the candidate more willing and=
able to use his persona as his most prominent campaign tool.
=E2=80=9CTrump is going to eschew everything the establishment and the pres=
s think he should be doing to have a total grassroots communications strate=
gy,=E2=80=9D Stone said in the interview. =E2=80=9CHe=E2=80=99ll be all ove=
r the media, doing as many interviews as he can, calling into radio shows, =
and having wall-to-wall rallies that get broadcast on the cable channels.=
=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CRemember,=E2=80=9D he added, =E2=80=9Cthose rallies also get you t=
o dominate the local news. So you=E2=80=99re all over the local channels, a=
ll over the national, wall-to-wall and free.=E2=80=9D
Stone didn=E2=80=99t always agree with Trump=E2=80=99s tactics.
=E2=80=9CI told him it couldn=E2=80=99t work. I was skeptical. An adviser t=
elling someone that you could win a presidential campaign by not spending m=
uch at all on ads? By simply going on TV? It was a historic calculation,=E2=
=80=9D he said.
=E2=80=9CBut he did it. A blunt speaking style, a repetition on three issue=
s, and you combine that with a sour and suffering electorate and it all wor=
ked,=E2=80=9D Stone said.
=E2=80=9CHe=E2=80=99s not programmable. There was a time 30 years ago I tri=
ed to put words in his mouth but it didn=E2=80=99t take. You can tell him c=
oncepts. But he doesn=E2=80=99t want to take someone else=E2=80=99s words. =
He=E2=80=99s not comfortable doing it. He=E2=80=99d rather watch the cultur=
e, the news, pick up what he can.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CNo one knew what he is going to do. I still don=E2=80=99t know wha=
t he=E2=80=99ll do,=E2=80=9D Stone said.
Neither do most Republicans and Democrats. The only guarantee: he'll be on =
TV, and nearly everywhere else,=C2=A0soon.
