Hi Phil,
Seems to me that CRU should charge him a fee for the service. He shouldn't be under the
assumption that he has the right to demand reports be scanned in for him on a whim. CRU
should require reasonable monetary compensation for the labor, effort (and postage!).
It this were a colleague acting in good faith, I'd say do it at no cost.  But of, course,
he's not. He's not interested in the truth here, he's just looking for another way to try
to undermine confidence in our science.
Henry's review looks helpful and easy to deal w/.  Will be interesting to see the other
reviews. I guess you're going to get your moneys' worth out of your scanner,
mike
