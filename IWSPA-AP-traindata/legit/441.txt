This is just about the wackiest psych wackiness I've
ever heard.
In Plattsburg, New York, they have a "Mental Health
Court" where criminals are turned into mental
patients. New York state, by the way, has the largest
percentage of psychs in the country. Read this article
if you can stand complete illogics and false data.

Text at bottom.
Write a letter to the editor. Send it to
user@domain.com with a copy to 
user@domain.com
Write whatever you want but I suggest just forwarding
the general message of the unscientific nature of
psychiatry. Bring up something like the fact that
there is "no proof" of psychiatric disorders, it's all
opinion. Therefore, how can any of this have a place
in a court of law?
If you're so inclined, you can bring up the fact that
psych drugs are known to create violence, murder and
suicide.
