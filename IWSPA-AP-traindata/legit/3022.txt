Assignment 1. If you're anywhere near Clearwater, show
up at Flag tomorrow at 1:30pm for the CCHR Seminar.
The Industry of Death Museum is all set up. If you
haven't seen it, you have to see it! The seminar is
$15 in advance, $25 at the door. Call Flag and ask for
Charlotte in Div6 to buy your ticket.
I'll be there. If you've never met me, find me and
introduce yourself. You'll also get to listen to and
meet Ken Kramer.
