Keith,
This paper is in review, and can be referred to (just clear w/ Caspar or Gene first) for
IPCC draft purposes. They basically show that the  McIntyre and McKitrick paper is total
crap, and they provide an online version of the Mann et al method (and the proxy data), so
individuals can confirm for themselves...
