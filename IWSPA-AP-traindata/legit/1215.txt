Dear Phil,
Yeah, I had already seen the stuff from McIntyre. Tom Peterson sent it 
to me. McIntyre has absolutely no understanding of climate science. He 
doesn't realize that, as the length of record increases and trend 
confidence intervals decrease, even trivially small differences between 
an individual observed trend and the multi-model average trend are 
judged to be highly significant. These model-versus-observed trend 
differences are, however, of no practical significance whatsoever - they 
are well within the structural uncertainties of the observed MSU trends.
It would be great if Francis and Myles got McIntyre's paper for review. 
Also, I see that McIntyre has put email correspondence with me in the 
Supporting Information of his paper. What a jerk!
I will write to Keith again. The Symposium wouldn't be the same without 
him. I think Tom would be quite disappointed.
Have fun in Switzerland!
With best regards,
Ben
