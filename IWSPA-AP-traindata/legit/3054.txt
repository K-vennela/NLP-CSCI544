Hi all
I have ftp'd the updated cleaned up files from chapter 3 back onto your ftp site.  The
notes accompanying these are attached and are unchanged from yesterday.  There are two
references that may not be quite final.  These are from Global and Planetary Change and we
have doi's for them as they are published online, but no page numbers as they do not seem
to have appeared yet in print.  By the way, there was one notable error in the copy editing
which was confusion over significance and confidence levels.  I removed all the references
to confidence levels when it was about significance (of trends etc).  I suspect this could
affect other chapters though, so you may want to check that carefully.
The main concerns we have are with the figures, please see the comments on the figure files
and the brief comments in the attached.  If you would like me to make any of these changes
(Kristen) or assemble the panels, please let me know.
Regards
Kevin
