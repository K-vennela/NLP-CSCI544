Hi James
Thanks for doing this and let's keep it moving as fast as possible.  Yes 
the formatting in places is disconcerting and the line numbering is a 
bit on and off.
I have suggestions for changing two words. 
Line 13 “severely”  to "greatly"
Line 79 “more dramatic”  to  "greater"
As they stand, words like those used carry a lot of extra subjective 
tone that implies "bad" or has a commentary that is not desirable as per 
Rev 3.  I wonder if you should not be a bit more specific in responding 
to Rev 3 and say what other words were changed in the abstract at 
least?  If it were "word" I would send in a version of the abstract with 
tracking on.  It might make the difference between having the editor 
approve it and sending it back to Rev 3.
Best regards
Kevin
