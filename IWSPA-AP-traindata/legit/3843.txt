Dear Keith,
I'm very sorry to hear that both you and Sarah have not been well. I 
hope that both of you are feeling better soon. While I understand your 
decision, it's very sad that you won't be there on June 19th. I was 
really looking forward to a reunion of the "CRU gang". Despite its 
relatively small size, CRU has had (and continues to have!) a rather 
remarkable "fingerprint" in the world of climate science. The times we 
spent together while Tom was Director of CRU were exciting and 
extraordinary. It would have been fun to get together and celebrate 
those times, and to celebrate CRU's achievements under Tom's leadership.
Once again, best wishes to you and Sarah. Get well soon, and please let 
me know if you reconsider.
With best regards,
Ben
