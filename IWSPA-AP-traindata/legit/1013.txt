Ever notice how some people are able to gain support for their ideas-almost instantly it seems-while others must battle resistance to every single thing they propose?
It's all about influence.
Learning how to influence others-peers, superiors, even your customers-without relying on your position within the org chart is an art and an important one to master, because unfortunately, positional power doesn't actually carry the weight that you think it might.
When you need to achieve your objectives, simply being the "boss" isn't enough - you must have influence.
Mastering the art of influence can be the difference between achieving your goals and objectives and struggling for the resources and attention you need to get things done. When you master the art of influence, you will be highly successful at convincing others to listen to you, commit to your plans, and help you get your ideas off the ground.
So if you've grown tired of fighting resistance to your ideas or change initiatives, join best-selling author, Rick Maurer and learn how to gain others' support and commitment.
