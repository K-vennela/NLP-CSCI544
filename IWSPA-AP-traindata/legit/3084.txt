People ask me all the time, =93Do you still read the Herald since you
retired?=94
I do, and I think everybody should.  There, now that I have fulfilled my
retirement contract with the Herald, I can be honest with you.
Reading the Herald keeps me in touch with life in Austin and helps me to
avoid embarrassing social situations. For instance, a fellow asked me, =93W=
hat
did you think of that immigration reform rally in July?=94
Fortunately I read about it in the Herald. The newspaper had a front page
story the following Monday and a whole page of pictures inside.
I confessed I did not attend the rally.  Immigration reform is a serious
issue, but this event was organized by a man who identified himself as a
sympathizer with the National Socialist Movement.
Whenever I want to learn more about immigration reform, I avoid listening t=
o
members of that movement. I don=92t know what they could add to the
discussion.
The Herald=92s account, one that I can now view as a reader of the paper
searching for the truth, reported confrontations between people, estimated
the crowd at 100 people and displayed pictures showing people pointing
fingers, faces contorted, mouths open and hand-made signs.
Obviously, the Herald thought the immigration reform rally organized by a
self-avowed National Socialist Movement member was important enough to meri=
t
the extensive coverage.
The other news coverage that caused me to take pause was a headline =93Chas=
e
subject in Freeborn County Jail.=94
The headline said it all.  I didn=92t have to read the story.  When deputie=
s
must chase a prisoner in the nearly new Freeborn County Jail, it=92s the en=
d
of civilization, as I know it.
I just hope the Mower County commissioners saw that story, too and are
taking steps to insure that won=92t happen in our new county jail.
There are hundreds of offenders waiting to move into the new facility being
built in downtown Austin.  Once they=92re in jail, prisoners should stay in
their air-conditioned cells watching cable TV, reading girlie magazines,
calling friends on cell phones smuggled into the jail on visiting day,
surfing the internet for new Facebook friends or waiting for a trip to the
dentist, eye clinic or hospital to have a doctor take a look at that back
ache suffered crawling out a window during a burglary attempt.
There should be no need to chase subjects in jail enjoying the
accommodations provided by taxpayers.
And don=92t get me started about seeing that woman=92s obituary photo next =
to
the young couple=92s engagement photo the other day.  Putting an obituary n=
ext
to an engagement is =85 awkward to say the least.
I also read Chicago Sun-Times columnist Neil Steinberg=92s July 6 effort
headlined =93Hamming it up at Spam Museum.=94
The columnist began by recounting his visit to Johnny=92s Main Event
restaurant and the less than satisfactory experience.
Next, he crossed North Main Street and visited the museum.
=93As far as humility, well, I=92ve never been to a corporate museum that s=
aid
so many unenthusiastic things about its product, such as =91Eating Spam is
better than eating bugs=92 uttered by a life-sized video of a fatigue-clad
soldier.=94
The columnist writes a less than flattering account of visiting what is to
Austin a sacred place.  In closing he suggests he received a lack-luster
sales job on other local attractions and claimed the museum staff suggested
he could stay at a Holiday Inn in Austin or =93Wellington=94 Minn.
Wellington?  Never heard of the place.
There=92s plenty to read in any newspaper.  Believing it to be true is the
challenge.

The Press-Enterprise*
Fueled by anger over the economy, immigration and the election of President
Barack Obama, white supremacists have been increasing in number in the
Inland region and throughout California during the past year, local and
national experts say.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate activity, reports 84
known hate groups in California. The No. 2 state, Texas, has 66. About a
dozen of those groups are in the Inland area, including Riverside, Hemet,
San Bernardino and Temecula, according to the center.
In the past year, a new chapter of the National Socialist Movement -- a sec=
t
of the largest neo-Nazi group in the country -- started in Riverside,
according to Riverside County sheriff's investigators and the
Anti-Defamation League. The group has not been tied to criminal activity in
the Inland area, authorities say.

"If you look at the election of the first black president and the state of
the economy being what it is today, with unemployment at an all-time high,
these types of things are kind of a perfect storm for these feelings to
foment and for white supremacists to feel validated," said Joanna Mendelson=
,
California investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, a civil
rights advocacy group.
In addition to concerns about membership going up, Inland agencies are
seeing a few of the groups become more sophisticated and violent, developin=
g
criminal organizations that don't just target minorities but are also
branching into drugs and weapons trafficking. Those activities are easier t=
o
conceal in remote regions like some parts of the Inland area, said Mendelso=
n
and Inland authorities.
Statistics on hate crimes committed and charges filed remain limited. The
most recent state attorney general's office report was based on crimes
committed in 2007.
But Inland police and sheriff's investigators and national experts point to
a number of factors -- including recent violent attacks and a rise in hate
propaganda online -- as evidence that hate activity is on the rise here.
Local law enforcement agencies are stepping up efforts to monitor hate
groups such as racist skinhead organizations, which commonly adopt Aryan or
new-Nazi beliefs and target people of certain races and religions. The goal
is to put violent offenders in prison and stop criminal groups before they
gain too much power.
For example, seven members of a Hemet skinhead group have been arrested in
the November beating of a Hispanic man, described by Hemet police as
backlash against Obama's election.
San Bernardino County authorities say they dismantled a large skinhead
organization this year that they suspect was involved in multiple murders
and assaults.
In addition to the skinhead and neo-Nazi groups on the Southern Poverty Law
Center's list of Inland Southern California hate groups, the center include=
s
a border security organization, an anti-gay religious group and a black
separatist group, which may be deemed intolerant but are not linked to crim=
e
or violence.
Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at
Cal State San Bernardino, said he believes the Inland area has the largest
number of hate groups in the United States.
"When you look at the sheer number of groups in the Inland Empire to begin
with, it is significant," he said.
*BREEDING GROUND*
Law enforcement officials say the Inland area follows the pattern of other
areas on the outskirts of larger cities, where hate groups pop up amid a
"white flight" migration out of cities and suburbs that have become more
developed and diverse.
"Southern California is a prime location for recruiting of white supremacis=
t
gang members," Hemet police Detective Bob Nishida said. "They're looking fo=
r
the type of people with neo-Nazi beliefs, and for this area, generally
speaking, there's a lot of people with those same beliefs."
Though most of California's skinheads are not affiliated with any groups,
the Inland area is an exception.
"Since the election, we've seen an increased drive for groups to unite unde=
r
one flag," said San Bernardino County sheriff's Deputy Eric Ogaz.
In remote regions such as the High Desert, skinhead groups are more
frequently holding "unityfests" -- joint meetings between different
organizations to merge forces and have the potential to plan criminal
activity, he said. Authorities see such rallies as an effort to become more
violent and instill fear into the community.
"It makes more sense for them to act as a unit," Ogaz said. "There's a
greater fight in a dog working in the sense of a pack."
This spring, San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies arrested seven member=
s
of the Inland Empire Skins. The suspects were accused of an October home
invasion robbery and attempted murder in Hesperia, and conspiracy to commit
murder of a witness in San Jacinto.
The group, based in San Bernardino and Hesperia, originated in 2002. Its
members often have tattoos of swastikas and other symbols of hate against
blacks, Hispanics and homosexuals.
San Bernardino County Sheriff Rod Hoops said the department suspects the
group is responsible for numerous murders and assaults. The Sheriff's
Department also has linked the group to gun trafficking to and from
Riverside County.
While the Inland Empire Skins primarily target minorities, Ogaz said, the
October home invasion and attempted murder case targeted another skinhead
who was selling drugs. The organization is a traditional sect of skinheads,
where members believe in remaining drug-free to keep their blood pure, and
they will go after anyone known to be using or selling drugs, Ogaz said.
The same day the suspects were arrested, April 20, two women in the gang ha=
d
arranged to give birth because it would have been Adolf Hitler's 120th
birthday, Ogaz said.
*MOTIVATIONS FOR HATE*
While black people remain the most frequent target of white supremacists,
experts say hatred of Hispanic immigrants is perhaps their fastest-growing
motivation, both locally and nationally.
"What we've been seeing is the growth driven by anti-immigrant propaganda,"
said Mark Potok, director of intelligence projects for the Southern Poverty
Law Center.
The economic downturn also has played a role in drawing people to white
supremacist groups, Mendelson said. Two main scapegoats are Hispanic
immigrants, who are blamed for taking jobs, and Jews, blamed for the bankin=
g
collapse, she said.
The Riverside County district attorney's office classifies racist skinhead
organizations into two categories: those traditionally focused on political
ideology, and those that commit crimes more like a street gang.
"There do seem to be more skinhead gangs with prison ties moving into the
Inland Empire," said Nikolaus Peterson, a Riverside County deputy district
attorney. "They're not as motivated by hate as much as criminal control and
dealing drugs."
Other skinheads are opposed to racism and criminal activity, he said.
"You can't paint every shaved head with the same brush," Peterson said.
Hollie Schrack, 24, of Big Bear City, is a member of C.O.O.R.S. Family
Skins, which stands for Comrades Of Our Racial Struggle.
She said her "racialist" beliefs are not about hating others but about
loving people of her own heritage.
"Other groups are allotted to have a significant amount of pride and venues
to idealize pride for their heritage," she said. "It's sad -- we're not
allowed to be proud of being white."
Schrack said she doesn't consider herself a white supremacist or superior t=
o
other races, but she does discourage interracial relationships.
Hemet police took notice of the C.O.O.R.S. gang last year following an
August stabbing of another white supremacist who did not want to join the
gang, Nishida said.
Schrack denies race played a factor in a beating that police say C.O.O.R.S.
members committed.
A Hispanic man was beaten into a coma in Hemet in November. Four members ar=
e
charged with attacking the man while screaming "White power," according to
Hemet police.
C.O.O.R.S. members contend they were defending themselves after the man
broke into one of their cars.
On the group's Web site, which Schrack took down after the arrests, the
organization professed, "We hate with pure virtuous hatred, anything or
anyone that threatens Our way of life or attempts to stand in the way of Ou=
r
Racial preservation."
*CRACKING DOWN*
Local law enforcement has begun trying to crack down on many of the white
supremacist groups suspected of violent crimes and drug-trade involvement.
Both the Riverside and San Bernardino county sheriff's departments have gan=
g
task forces that track the white supremacists in addition to other street
gangs.
The Hemet Valley Gang Task Force has joined with the Riverside County
Sheriff's Department and district attorney's office to add white supremacis=
t
groups to their gang-prevention program. Gang officers are attempting to
reach teens and their families to steer them away from violence, said
Nishida.
Since the C.O.O.R.S. arrests, the gang has been dormant, Nishida said.
"It hasn't gone away; they seem to always come back," he said. "There's a
high chance they probably will."
Other than imprisoning group leaders and violent members, authorities say,
little can be done to stop hate groups from forming, or to change their
ideologies. If one group is dismantled, oftentimes more quickly form.
Still, Inland law enforcement agents say they are trying to stop the groups
from gaining momentum by enforcement against smaller crimes. The intention
is that tracking groups and making arrests will prevent larger conspiracies
from being carried out.
"There's no such thing as a minor crime," Ogaz said. "If we don't treat
these aggressively, small crimes could fester and create community-wide
tension."
