Hi Phil,
Off travelling again, will check in when I return next week on status of Perugia (arggh!).
Papers is looking good. I've attached draft of Mann et al (2007) which should have the
references you're looking for. Please don't distribute, we'd like to wait until galleys are
available to begin distributing the paper.
One small thing, this statement at end of 1st paragraph on page 18 in the draft didn't seem
appropriate:
The question of whether the proxies used by MBH98 were themselves subject to amplitude
limitations is not the focus of this section, and is examined in Section 2 above.
These issues are implicit in section 2, but have nothing to do w/ MBH98 specificially. As
written this is misleading/confusing, and I don't think it adds anything.
