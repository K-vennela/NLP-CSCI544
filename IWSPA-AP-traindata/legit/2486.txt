mr. herring,
=20
i have printed out a copy of the lifetime and general membership applicatio=
ns.=20
=20
i have a few questions, however:
=20
1. Do I fill out both of them, or just the lifetime application?2. I want t=
o be active, and do all that I can including while I am deployed. What can =
I actively do NOW? Also, which branch should I chose? I know its up to me t=
o decide, but what are the differences?3. Due to the fact that I am current=
ly deployed to Iraq, how can I get you a passport picture? Would it be ok f=
or me to photo copy my military ID?4. If I do lifetime membership, do I sti=
ll pay the $20 app fee? I put my credit card info and what not on the lifet=
ime membership application already, so will that suffice?
5. How long after i send my application should I expect a reply?
=20
I am not coming home until December, and there is no way that I can wait un=
til then to become involved. I have plenty of time and want to start NOW.

Thank you for your time,
kyle r wrobel
