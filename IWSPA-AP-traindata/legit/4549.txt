Comrades,
In response to some of the talk in the nsmworld e-list about doing a White
March on the Nations Capitol, the NSM is currently in the process of working
on this matter. Such things take time, however, big plans are in the works
for 2008, and you can expect us to be at the forefront, taking the fight
directly into the streets as usual. I am not making an Official announcement
at this point, however when I do, we will be calling for all factions of the
Pro-White Movement to Unite for that day to form up the largest Pro-White
march of this decade. All ego's, drama, and differences will be cast aside,
for the eyes of the Public and Worldwide media will be upon us. A word of
advice, start saving up some travel money now, because in 2008 we will be
making History and all Pro-White activists should want to be part of it. A
CALL FOR ACTION, NOT WORDS!!! Hail Victory!
