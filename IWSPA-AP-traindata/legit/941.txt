Hi guys,
I know there are some questions about this.  This allotment is different from the concert names that we submitted last week.  This is for admittance to the actual summit (full of policy panels and guest speakers) and has nothing to do with the sponsorship of the concert.
We only have 25 tickets total, and I know lots of you have tons of requests for people to submit.  I'm going to let you know which women are already on my list from your region and then we can work together to edit/add from there!
Thanks to all of you who have already submitted names!
Claire
