Dear Stephen,
Hope you are well.
We had a meeting with SMT to talk about a release date of CHAPPIE / PIXELS/ HOTEL T 2.
Re:CHAPPIE
Case 1
We would like to release it from May 16th ,2015.  However ,WB has already offered FOCUS at the same period.
We asked SMT to persuade WB into changing the release date of FOCUS and we are just waiting for their reply now.
The reason why we want to release it from May 16th  is because we should not go with Avengers 2 or Fast & Furious 7.
Please see the competitors release date as follows;
The Man From U.N.C.L.E.   April 18
Avengers 2       April 25
Secret Service     May 22
Fast & Furious 7  June 6 or 13
We don’t have much information about domestic movies at the present.
Case 2
From June 27th
Tomorrow Land   July 4
Terminator 5     July 10
TOHO animation  July18
Inside Out       July18
Mad Max        July 24
Minions         July 31
As you know it is very competitive during a summer vacation period of 2015 so we should release it before the season not to face them.
Re:PIXELS
We have reached an agreement on our release date with SMT.
From September 19(Sat)    There are five consecutive holidays.
2015 Calendar
Sep 19 (Sat)
Sep 20 (Sun)
Sep 21 (National holiday)
Sep 22 (National holiday)

San Andreas Sep 11
Ant-Man    Sep 19
Silence     Sep 19
Passengers Sep 19
Many distributors aim at the same date , however, PIXELS is our tent-pole movie so we want to release it from that day.
We have been informed that the release date in US is May 15 or mid July. That is good for us because we will have enough time to promote it and 
we can attach its trailer on summer big movies.
Re : HOTEL T 2
We were planning to release it from Sep 19. But due to PIXELS releasing, our tentative release date is Oct.10. 
It is not the holiday season and there are only 2 national holidays in four weeks.
The final box office of the previous one was 138 M JPY so we should be careful spending money on HOTEL T 2.
Just between us, due to the result of the previous one, exhibitors’ expectations of HOTEL T 2 are not high at the moment.
We would like to discuss with you sometime next week.
Sincerely ,
Kazushi
