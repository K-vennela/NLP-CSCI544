Hi Fortunat and friends - I suggest that we 
(Fortunat, can you do this?) ask Thomas Stocker 
since he has lots of experience w/ IPCC and knows 
what we're trying to do too. Is this ok?
If it's ok (and I'm guessing that it might not be 
ok to use an unpublished extended solar series, 
as Fortunat suggest - but it would be more 
comparable to other results in the same figure 
(our old 6.10)), I think scaling to Bard would be 
better since this is what has been done more in 
the other simulations published and in the old 
Fig. 6.10 - am I correct?
If we can't scale Judith's new recon back to 
1000, then we'll just have some simulated series 
back to 1610.
Again, thanks Fortunat for figuring it all out.
best, peck
