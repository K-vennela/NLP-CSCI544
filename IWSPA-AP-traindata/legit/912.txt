The FCC spectrum screen is coming under increasing focus as the FCC contemplates rules for the upcoming AWS-3 spectrum auction.  On Wednesday, Verizon posted a public policy blog and submitted a FCC filing that urges the FCC to expand the spectrum screen.  This is not the first time that Verizon or AT&T has pushed on this issue and they have some valid arguments.  The stakes are high as the new FCC guidelines could open up spectrum acquisition opportunities for Verizon and AT&T and in our view Dish could be one of those options.  In addition, if Sprint’s 2.5 GHz is counted in the screen, it could have impact the level of divestitures required if it bought T-Mobile. The FCC’s March Open meeting could be the first opportunity to hear more details on how this will emerge.
