Hi Frank
I have two names - one of which you know well. First , I strongly urge that one copy be sent to 
Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology
8 Marta St., 202
Ekaterinburg, 620144, Russia
This is the home of the Laboratory of Dendrochronology , headed by
Dr. Stepan G. Shiyatov and I would suggest you consign the book to him,
or through him , to a genearl library if one exists.

I know they have very limited resources but they will make real use of the volume . They are genuinely active and the work they do is truly 'world class'. You will remember also that one of their younger scientists (Rashit Hantemirov) won a prize in London at the Open Science meeting for his poster on the long Yamal chronology. This group gets my first and strongest vote.
My other suggestion is to send one to Eugene Vaganov's Institute of Forest.
They are not so strapped for resources as the Ekaterinburg lab. but they are large and have many active areas of research and the book would get a wide audience.
Eugene's email is
ifor@krsk.infotel.ru
Then there is the question of getting them there . The post is not reliable. You might send then to Fritz Schweingruber's laboratory from where they could be picked up or carried to Russia ? 
Hope this helps
best wishes
Keith
