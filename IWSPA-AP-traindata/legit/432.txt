Hi Keith - might be worth talking on the phone - you, me and Eystein 
- after you get back. You could be right, but it is a powerful way to 
look at the issue. The question is whether the normalization could be 
preventing a warmer than late-20th century signal from appearing?
Should we instead update the Bradley Science graphic? That's not as 
effective in my opinion.
So, let's talk next week?
Going to a tree day meeting or a three day meeting - it has to be 
tough looking at tree data all day.
have fun, thx, peck
