Tom,
Program and the input LKS file. Program is adapted from one I had. Ended up a little
convoluted. Should work with any of the 4 CRU temp data files (CRUTEM2(v), HadCRUT2(v)).
For the Russian, grid point, changing 4 59 to 4 57 will give a box with data in from
1929.
3rd file is my unix run file - for files to channels.
Cheers
Phil
