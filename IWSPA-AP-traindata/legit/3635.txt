Comrade Bill,
Your possible new duties will be revealed to you in due time. Speaking at the next rally is certainly something we would like to see you do. Also I meant what I said about Angela, she see's it as Duty (and it is), but the Party Leadership see's a few different kinds of people. The people that always catch my attention are the ones that go out of their way to push a little harder and do a little extra in all they do. Be it saving up to attend our events, being the first one at roll call, picking up after events, simply volunteering for extra duties/work, or like in Angela case (or some of our elderly guys), getting out there even when it is physically difficult. 
Ok, I gotta cut it short, too much too do, too little time. Thanks again for all you do. 88 Commander Schoep
