the fatal blow by winning Indiana's primary -- making the real estate mog=
ul the presumptive nominee for the Republican nomination. Bernie Sanders t=
opped Hillary Clinton in Indiana -- but it likely won't make much of a dif=
ference in the Democratic primary fight. Your bartender is Eric Bradner (h=
