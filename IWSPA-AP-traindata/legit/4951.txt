Hi Keith (and Eystein - we need your opinion) - thanks for the quick 
response. I think it easier (imagining the mess of email that could 
result) if we focus on one bullet/email. So I'll start w/ the first, 
and hope that Eystein can also weigh in.
With regard to the first one below, I agree that we can leave 
statistics out of it. Good point.
But, I think we must at least address Susan's concern. To do 
otherwise would be counterproductive. She makes sense. I think your 
MWP results is quite appropriate - they were published in Science, 
and in my reading of the paper, you are convincing. If it's in the 
chapter, it makes sense to draw on it for the exec summary. Please 
defend more convincingly, or suggest an alternative way to deal with 
Susan's concern - what is the significance (not statistical) of this 
one record being warmer? We need to say it.
If you really want to leave as is, please write your response in a 
way that I can forward to Susan - we can't ignore he comment in this 
case, because other (me, at least) think it makes sense. So we have 
to convince her too - this is big stuff for the AR4, and will be in 
the TS/SPM. We can't be as vague as the current bullet is.
And as for the MWP box fig, I think it should be as you suggest - 
combine the existing fig w/ the new one from Tim and your paper. I 
think Tim might already be working on it?
Sorry to be a tough guy, but this bullet needs to be more clear.
Thanks, peck
