Dear Phil,
It looks like you have found Baitoushan.  Vol. 2 lists Kuwae as VEI 6 in 
1452 +/- 10 AD.  How accurate are your dates?  By the way, Chris Newhall 
thinks 1600 is the Parker volcano on Mindanao in the Philippines.  He 
hasn't published that so far, as I know.
Could you please define "utter prat" for me?  Sometimes I think we speak 
the same language, and sometimes I'm not so sure.
I'm doing fine.  We have a new building with nice new offices.  I'm going 
to Australia next week with Sherri and Danny, and after the meeting, will 
visit Cairns, Adelaide, and New Zealand.  I'm looking forward to skiing 
on a volcano, if it stops erupting.
