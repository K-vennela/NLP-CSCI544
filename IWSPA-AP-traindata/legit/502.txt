1) PRESSURE COOKER: FBI Director James Comey says he feels "pressure" to wrap up his investigation of HILLARY CLINTON's private server and email practices. But he says that doing the investigation in a competent way is more important than doing it quickly.
POLITICO's Josh Gerstein reports Comey gave an update - of sorts - into the investigation of Clinton's email server during a roundtable with reporters at the FBI's headquarters. Comey said he's not taking political events, including upcoming party conventions, into account: "I don't tether to any external deadline," he said. 
But Comey also batted away more specific questions about the investigation's status. Though he said that he was following it closely. "I remain close to the investigation to make sure it's done well and has the resources that are needed," Comey said.

Happy Wednesday. Don't know about Director Comey, but we feel like life is just one big external deadline and further - ah, never mind. Here's your 2016 Blast. Henry C.

2) PRELUDE TO A MEETING: Tomorrow, DONALD TRUMP and Paul Ryan will meet in Washington to try to hash things out. Today, Ryan met with some of Trump's allies on the Hill, perhaps getting a preview of what he can expect. As POLITICO's Rachael Bade reports, Ryan quietly met with a handful of Trump's supporters - including Reps. Chris Collins (R-N.Y), Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) and Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) - who made a pitch to Ryan about why he should back Trump. <<link>> This issue is dicey for Ryan: As POLITICO's Jake Sherman and Rachael Bade report, Trump's brand of politics - and his popularity within the GOP - put the House Speaker in a vise.

3) STICKER SHOCK: DONALD TRUMP had tasked a pair of conservative economists, Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore, with revising his tax plan. <<link>> And, they duly came up with what they called some "tweaks." As POLITICO's Shane Goldmacher reports, though, what they submitted to the nonprofit Tax Foundation for a new deficit score amounts to a dramatic rewrite of Trump's original plan. <<link>> As Goldmacher reports: The new plan, compared against Trump's initial proposal, would increase tax rates across all income levels, dramatically reduce the number of people who would pay no income taxes at all and impose a new cap
on charitable deductions for the wealthy. Trump's supporters remain bullish on his economic policies, though: POLITICO's Brian Faler and Matthew Nussbaum report that a Trump adviser claims his economic policies will result in a $7 trillion net surplus - a wildly optimistic number, at best. <<link>> 
4) GENERAL SENSE OF WORRY: HILLARY CLINTON is bracing for a very tight election. That's the message from Brooklyn, as her campaign tries to gear up for a general election fight against DONALD TRUMP. <<link>> As our broadcast friends say, though: But first: She's still laboring to escape a primary quagmire. POLITICO's Gabriel Debenedetti reports she's stuck between two worlds: Her nomination appears inevitable, but her path past BERNIE SANDERS is exposing her as deeply fallible. <<link>> 
5) BERN BURNS: You know who doesn't really care about HILLARY CLINTON's quagmire? BERNIE SANDERS. Appearing on MSNBC, Sanders bristled when Andrea Mitchell asked him about Clinton's problems locking up the Democratic nomination. <<link>> "Please do not moan to me about HILLARY CLINTON's problems," he said. Sanders' path to the Democratic nomination is difficult - to say the least. And that task was complicated by the departure of his state director in crucial California, as POLITICO's Gabriel Debenedetti reports. <<link>> One thing Sanders is concerned about, however, is steering his supporters away from voting for
DONALD TRUMP. <<link>> 
TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, DONALD TRUMP says intentions matter and nabs a Rubio recruit. Unions prep for a fight. HILLARY CLINTON pans his tax plan, BERNIE SANDERS gets a Geraldo scolding, and Ted Nugent, man. Ted Nugent.

CAT SCRATCH FEVER: Ted Nugent posted a video of BERNIE SANDERS shooting HILLARY CLINTON. Yikes! <<link>> 
WHAT'S NEXT: Democrats continue to focus on June 7 states. BERNIE SANDERS heads to South Dakota. 
THEY SAID IT: "We want to do it well and we want to do it promptly. I feel pressure to do both of those things. As between the two things, we will always choose 'well.'" - James Comey, giving an update on the FBI investigation into HILLARY CLINTON's email practices. <<link>> 
MAGIC NUMBER: 27. That's how many days until California holds its primary - and BERNIE SANDERS now lacks a state director there. <<link>>
