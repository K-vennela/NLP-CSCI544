Gavin, Mike,
Thanks for this!
I assume you are both aware of this prat - Neil Craig, see below. Keith won't be
responding.
Checking facts doesn't seem important these days. As CA threads aren't publications this
is difficult for non scientists.
I am going further over one email I got at the weekend - see also below. Typical of Sonia
- although she now seems to only be an emeritus reader!
Cheers
Phil

Professor Briffa,
I have written a couple of blogs on the current report by Steve
McIntyre that the data used by Mann to "prove" the hockey Stick was fabricated. This & the
following day's

.
As a result I have received this email from somebody I am not aquainted with throwing
the entire blame on you. This seems improbable to me & possibly an alarmist damage
limitation exercise. If you wish to comment I would be happy for you to do so.
"Please note: Steve McIntyre's post concerns work by climate scientist Keith Briffa and
not Michael Mann. You will probably wish to correct your post.
Cheers
Avisame"
I have posted this as an update with my reply:
"My understanding is that while Briffa did the tree ring measurement, Mann, in his paper,
chose to choose 12 atypical tree rings out of at least 34 to fabricate the global warming
trend. My assumption is that Mann is responsible for fabrications in his own paper & that
this is a damage limitation exercise. I am open to correction on this & indeed have emailed
Mr Briffa to see. "

We received this through our enquiries desk.  I assume that you are aware of this person,
including those copied on the message.
If we are to respond, it would be to indicate that there are multiple sources of supporting
evidence and that we continue to place our confidence in the international scientific
assessment process.  This confidence has proven to be well placed.
