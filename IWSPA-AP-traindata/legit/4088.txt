Hi Neil - Thanks for your interest in providing feedback on the draft 
chap 6 Second Order Draft. Since the IPCC has very strict rules about 
all this, I'm going to ask them (the IPCC) to send you an official 
invitation to review, along with the process - formal, but highly 
efficient - to follow. If you could send your comments in that way it 
would be a great help. We've been asked to keep everything squeaky 
clean, and not to get comments informally.
Thanks! Peck
