The delegate breakdown is:
At-Large-7 delegates

Republican Process
The Republican Caucus took place on Saturday, March 12.  A Territorial Caucus convened as a Convention to choose 6 delegates to the Republican National Convention.  There is no formal system to relate the presidential preference of the Convention participants to the choice of the delegates to the Republican Convention.  In addition, 3 party leaders, the National Committeeman, the National Committeewoman, and the chairman of the Guam's Republican Party, will attend the convention as unpledged delegates by virtue of their position.
