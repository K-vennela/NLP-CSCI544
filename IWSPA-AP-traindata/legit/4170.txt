Mike,
I'd rather you didn't. I think it should be sufficient to forward the para from Andrew
Conrie's
email that says the paper has been rejected by all 3 reviewers. You can say that the
paper was an extended and updated version of that which appeared in CR.
Obviously, under no circumstances should any of this get back to Pielke.
Cheers
Phil
