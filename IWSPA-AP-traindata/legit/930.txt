Hi all,
Two things:
1. Concerning the 1470k pacing of DO-events. 
There are revisions underway in the 
layer-counting of the Greenland Ice Cores. A 
meeting in Copenhagen in August co-ordinated by 
Sigfus Johnsen will discuss the issue at length, 
but there may not be many papers out from the 
meeting that are citeable for IPCC. There is 
already the Shackleton paper which indicate that 
Greenland Ice Cores in MIS3 have an age model 
that are off by some millennia, and the 
preliminary data on the new age models indicate 
substantial revisions as far as I hear from talks 
given at various meetings. My thinking is that 
we neither can ignore the fact that current data 
indicate a 1470 pacing for some time interval of 
the ice cores if one apply the existing age 
scales. I think it would be foolish not not refer 
to it, I think the possibility that the system 
has  the ability to enter into specific cycles is 
intriguing, and is a  result that is well known 
and IPCC should not pretend we havent heard 
about it. But we should make it less blunt than 
in the current version of the Abrupt Change 
subchapter, perhaps stating that the result is 
highly dependant on age models and we need time 
to absorb new research in order to verify the 
result.
2. Having the fortune of not being that close to 
the darker sides of US politics, I have the 
feeling that Pecks comment concerning 
referencing perhaps is a bit too "paranoic". I 
think the advice is well taken not to overcite 
our own research, and make sure not to overlook 
other important contributions, but we should do 
our best to cite what we think are key results. 
In any case we will have the FOD review and have 
the opportunity to have all our good colleagues 
keeping us honest on this issue.
Cheers,
Eystein
