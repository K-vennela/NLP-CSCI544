As I read the 8/30/99 agreement = if the “other properties” agreements get renewed past the 2014 date, he would continue to get his payment  - which, pre the 2003 agreement would be at the 20% rate.  Is that correct?  The way it is represented on the summary with the payment terms in a separate paragraph from the “other tv properties” section doesn’t make that clear.  If IGT elected prospectively to make a machine based on those properties he is “attached” – correct?  Is he attached for any property from our library?  Note that some of the earlier docs refer to the library quire broadly to include GSN.  Looks like there is potentially a broader issue here.
