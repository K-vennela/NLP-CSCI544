Hi Keith, Phil and Tim,
Please find attached an outline bid for the NERC Consortium bid we
discussed at the end of last year.  I must apologise for the delay in
getting back to you.  Exeter has suddenly gone mad with appointments
of staff and postgrads.  It's all good fun but it's taken up a lot of
my time over the past couple of months.
For a NERC Consortium we need to put in a 2 page document as an
expression of interest.  If approved we can then go forward for
submission. The next deadline is 1 July.
Can you have a look at the attached and let me know what you think?
Could you let me know what sort of support you'd need if we go
forward.  We have up to 3.5 million to spend over 5 years. Included
in the document we have to include a summary of the funding we'd like
to get from NERC, any other funds we have in support and other
benefits e.g. training.  For the latter we envisaged approximately 1
postdoc and 2 PhDs per UK institution.
I'm currently in Copenhagen for a meeting so my email contact will be
a little erratic but am back Friday.
Hope things are going well.
All the best,
Chris
