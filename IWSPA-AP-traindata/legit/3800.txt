Dear Keith.
I had a chat with Dominique Reynaud on this matter today here in Nice. His impression is the same, but added that he thinks Brussels would insist on a NoE rather than an IP. If we wish to have an IP it needs lobbying it seems. He told about the meeting in Brussels inJune. I am not invited as far as I can tell. Dominique mentioned that Nick Shackleton would be there and I will talk with him. The key thing would be to sort out what the most exciting science our community can offer when we integrate the communities.
In terms of meetings it seems to depend alittle of what comes out of the June meeting in Brusseks.
Cheers
Eystein
