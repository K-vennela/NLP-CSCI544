Samsung wasn't interested in buying RIM, still isn't interested in buying RIM Engadget  Samsung already passed on webOS, and now, it's passing on RIM. The flagging handset maker was reportedly in talks with Samsung about a buyout, but according to a fresh Reuters report, Sammy's "not interested" in taking over Research In Motion. Samsung spokesman James Chun said the following: "We haven't considered acquiring the firm and are not interested in (buying RIM)." Why even respond to a rumor? Well, RIM's shares surged some ten percent at just the whisper, further proving that stocks in the digital age are little more than sophisticated gambling blocks when unfounded rumors are bandied about. So, that's that -- Samsung's not buying RIM, the sun's still warm, and RIM is still too far away from BlackBerry 10.Samsung wasn't interested in buying RIM, still isn't interested in buying RIM originally appeared on Engadget on Tue, 17 Jan 2012 19:01:00 EDT.
