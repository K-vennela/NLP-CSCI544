Hmmm. I note the following ,,,
"at which I can be contacted between 9 and 7 pm Eastern Daylight Time"
Is this a 22 hour, or, for people with time machine, a negative 2 hour
window?
Joking aside, it seems as a matter of principle (albeit a principle yet 
to be set by the courts) that provision of primary data sources that are 
sufficient to reproduce the results of a scientific analysis is all that 
is necessary under FOI.
It also seems that judgment of what correspondence is central to the
analysis can only be made by the persons involved. As a participant in
many of these inter-author communications, I do not recall any that
would give information not already contained in the published paper.
