Hillary Clinton has won the Pennsylvania Democratic primary, according to the Associated Press.
The former secretary of state led comfortably over Bernie Sanders in a series of recent state polls. In a Fox News survey published Monday, Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Sanders, 52 percent to 41 percent.
Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, campaigned hard in the state, holding roughly 10 events throughout the past week.
On Saturday in Dunmore, Clinton appeared to turn her eye beyond Sanders, whom she only referred to as "my opponent." She largely focused on raising incomes, touting the effectiveness of her husband's administration while calling out Donald Trump by name for suggesting that wages are too high.
Pennsylvania awards 127 of its 189 pledged delegates proportionally based on each of the state's congressional districts. The remaining delegates - 42 at-large and 20 pledged party leaders and elected officials - are allocated based on the statewide vote.
