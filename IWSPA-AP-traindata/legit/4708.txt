Dr. Douglass:
I assume that you are referring to the Santer et al. paper which has 
been submitted to the International Journal of Climatology (IJoc). 
Despite your claims to the contrary, the Santer et al. IJoC paper is not 
essential reading material in order to understand the arguments advanced 
by Peter Thorne (in his "News and View" piece on the Allen and Sherwood 
"Nature Geosciences" article).
I note that you did not have the professional courtesy to provide me 
with any advance information about your 2007 IJoC paper, which was 
basically a commentary on previously-published work by myself and my 
colleagues. Neither I nor any of the authors of those 
previously-published works (the 2005 Santer et al. Science paper and the 
2006 Karl et al. CCSP Report) had the opportunity to review your 2007 
IJoC paper prior to its publication - presumably because you 
specifically requested that we should be excluded from consideration as 
possible reviewers.
I see no conceivable reason why I should now send you an advance copy of 
my IJoC paper. Collegiality is not a one-way street, Professor Douglass.
Sincerely,
Dr. Ben Santer
