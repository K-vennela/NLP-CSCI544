I am impressed. Blaze is an outstanding, really outstanding guy. He fought the Clinton’s CLIPPER CHIP initiative during the 1990’s crypto wars in fact showing a clever way to use CLIPPER and at the same time defeating its key escrow functions. Incredibly amazing: he showed he was cleverer than the NSA!
