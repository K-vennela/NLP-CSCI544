Hi Paul,You should share this information with Germany and Italy in case they are interested.Many thanks,Nigel From: Stapley-Tovey, Paul 
Sorry, I forgot to mention that when I was discussing this with Jeff earlier today he suggested that Mel Brooks might be able to dub the German and possibly the Italian - I don't know if this has any value in the territories but I thought I'd mention it.

Hi Nigel,
From: Clark, Nigel 
Dear Paul, Here we go….time to put on your ‘Hotel T 2’ hat…. Bob Osher called me. He is thrilled that he has stunt-cast Mel Brooks to voice Vlad (Drac’s father) in the US version of the forthcoming sequel. Bob feels this is particularly relevant with this year being the 40th anniversary of the release of ‘Young Frankenstein’.  Taking a page out of the Pixar / Dreamworks / Disney playbook, Bob wants to be in a position to make a consecutive announcement on the stunt-casting for this role in other major territories. The release is currently timed for October. Do you have a character bio for Vlad? Certainly in the version of the film that I saw a while ago, it’s a relatively small role. Just an idea, but I wonder if there are actors / comedians that we should consider who have some kind of connection to the world of Dracula specifically, or horror generally? Perhaps the French or Germany equivalent of Vincent Price? (preferably someone who’s not dead of course). I’d welcome your thoughts as to the feasibility of getting this role cast pretty quickly. Best regards,Nigel
