Dear NSM Party Comrades,
=20
As you all know the Party has been making great strides forward in recent y=
ears. We are currently the largest Pro-White group in America, and the only=
unabashadly, openly NS Party in America. There is no where else, and no ot=
her Party here in the U.S. that comes even close to us, but I am sure you a=
lready know that. Of course because we are all members of the same team, ri=
ght?=20
=20
Recently certain Party members have been at each others throats. Some Party=
members were called into a room before Nationals because of such behavior,=
now a new set of people are at it again. First, I will list my own faults,=
I have been too fair, too nice, too easy going, and too lenient hoping it =
would all come together. Instead it has been a huge burden watching my Brot=
hers and Sisters pick each other apart. One Party Officer has been demoted =
for conduct unbecoming of an Officer, and anyone, I mean anyone who continu=
e's in any sort of drama that deviates from the mission at hand, will be ne=
xt. I do not expect any of you to like these orders, or even agree with it,=
but I do expect your Loyalty and continued service to the Folk. The Party =
runs on the Fuhrerprinzip, it is not a democracy, and all matters in which =
we do things are always well calculated for the greater good of the whole P=
arty. Personal likes, dislikes, feuds, conflict, that is all normal. Confli=
ct has existed since the dawn of time. All Comrades need to focus on their =
own tasks and work, and not worry about others who work in other Depts.=20
=20
I have been thinking about these matters for a few weeks now, and had serio=
usly considered removing certain conflicting members from the Ranks all tog=
ether. When Col. Bishop and I have to play babysitter, and talk to people a=
bout drama, it makes us, all of you, and our Party look foolish. America is=
being overrun with Mexicans and other invaders, instead of expelling certa=
in people, these members and the Party are better served if the drama is sa=
ved for the playground, and we all get back to work.
=20
Most of you recieving this will have no idea what I am talking about, good =
deal, just consider this a shake up then. This directive is a direct order =
from myself and Col. Bishop. Most of you rarely see me order any of my Comr=
ades to do anything, I work alongside of you, and for you.=20
=20
This directive should be sent to all active Party members, not all of you a=
re in my e-mail address book, so forward to only those members that need to=
read it.=20
=20
On a positive note, Party projects are going forward and we are growing eve=
ry single day. We will be announcing the next NSM Public meeting with a wee=
k, it will be a good one.=20

Hail Victory! Commander Schoep and on behalf of Col. Bishop
