Hi Eystein and Peck,
sorry, but I'm *still* working on the figures.  On the simulations 
one, we were requested to include results from the new Stendel et al. 
(2005, Clim. Dyn.) simulation with ECHAM4-OPYC3 for the last 500 
years.  Did you get these data already?  I've just emailed Martin 
Stendel to ask for them, but thought I'd check in case you already had them.
Cheers
Tim
