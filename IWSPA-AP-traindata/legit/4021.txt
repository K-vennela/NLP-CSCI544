*National Socialist Movement (NSM) Fires Back at the Jewish Defense *
*Organization (JDO)*
*For Immediate Release*
Detroit, MI. 15 January. The National Socialist Movement (NSM) today
confirmed
their intent to remain and grow in the Brooklyn, New York area despite
intense
pressure from the militant Jewish Defense Organization (JDO). "The NSM is a
force for peace and prosperity. Too long have we allowed our enemies to
define
us to the world. NSM members bomb and murder only in the propaganda
dreams of all who wish to keep us quiet," stated a spokesperson for the
group.
He added, "Our intent in Brooklyn - and in all parts of the country - is to
build a
political force capable of reinvigorating White America, the true America."
The JDO's website harshly criticized and challenged the new NSM Brooklyn
location, referring to the group as "pigs," "Aushwitz (sic) seeking Nazis,"
and
promised to "run the Nazis out of their Headquaters (sic), get them evicted
from
their homes, and drive them out of the state." A "huge rally" is also
planned,
according the JDO website.
Reacting to the JDO's statements, the NSM spokesperson replied, "One of the
reasons true, White, America, remains fearful is because they believe no one
will
fight for them anymore. Watching the NSM in the face of JDO and all other
provocation helps awaken our folk." Asked to explain more, the spokesman
continued, "Watching us stand toe-to-toe with the enemy, white people begin
to
remember pride. They begin to remember nationalism. Our goal is peace,
prosperity and liberty. Watching us, our folk begin to understand. We
welcome
our opposition. Because," the spokesperson concluded, "because our
opposition
also will come to know our pride, our power and our persistence."
*About the NSM*
