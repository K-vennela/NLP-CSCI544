How to Read an Insurance Policy:=A0
Understanding Your Coverage Before a Loss Occurs=A0
Examining the basic components of a commercial insurance policy to help you=
understand your=A0
coverage and identify areas that put your financial institution at risk.
Despite the near ubiquity of insurance in modern commerce and business mana=
gement, many professionals -- even in risk management and legal departments=
-- have very little understanding of how their insurance policies work, or=
what they may or may not cover should a loss occur. The law in virtually e=
very state holds that a policyholder is assumed to have read, understood, a=
nd agreed to all of the terms of every policy it buys. Realistically, that =
almost never happens. Although each policy is different, the vast majority =
of commercial insurance policies share the same anatomy. Given what is at s=
take should a policyholder face a loss, it is critical that attorneys, risk=
management professionals, and business owners understand the components of=
their policies to ensure that they are adequately covered or identify area=
s of risk exposure.
Please join Joseph G. Balice as he discusses the common components of insur=
ance policies and special considerations you should take into account to he=
lp you understand your coverage and identify risk areas before a problem ar=
ises.
