Hi Prof. Zhang: thanks for your email and good to hear about your book. I will send the
reference file to the LAs for them to incorporate as appropriate. You will also be editing
the ZOD when it's complete, or of specific sections before then if you ask the appropriate
leader of a section of interest (see previous listserv email with this list in case you
don't remember from Italy).
Regarding  6.5.9, I will cc this to Dan and Ramesh so you can coordinate with them
directly. This is the process we have adopted for all subsections so we don't waste time
with the CLA's having to relay messages. Go direct...
I will also CC to Jean-Claude and Keith, so they make sure they have checked your input.
Many thanks, Peck
@Dear  Peck:
...
As regards Section 6.5.9 I shall do my utmost to help Den and Ramesh. But the
assistance is to come only after I have read through their draft . Only in that way can
I form an ideal "it must be relevant to policy makers" .  I have been accustomed to
write about scientific facts. Now I am confronted with a new problem how to serve the
purpose of another style. Otherwise my suggestions would be of no use.
I had sent paragraphs to Jean-Claunde for Section 6.2.2 and to Keith Briffa for
section 6.3.2.1. last Nav..
With best wishes,
