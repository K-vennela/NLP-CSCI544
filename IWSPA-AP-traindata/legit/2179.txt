Dear All My colleague Emma and I are submitting everything this morning. I'm doing the
email version, Emma the 4 hard copies to the office in York before 2pm. Peter provided a
very useful edit yesterday which has got the proposal down under 4,000 words. Please find
attached: 1. Proposal registration form (I have just put in CAG details as main proposer
but flagged up its a partnership bid) 2. Summary (just under 600 words as required) 3.
Proposal 4. Budget form (their's and an extra one they agreed I could do to show who does
what days - don't worry about days shown - its provisional - we can revise and rearrange it
if we get the job!) 5. Staff Costs forms (attached to the budget form but not filled in as
they agreed we didn't have to submit these - they don't work with day rates) 6. Full CVs
for all Proposers (Emma is adding in some final material she has but coudnt access
yesterday - we will send round the very final version for your records once done this
morning) 7. Three appendices as one Word document (to go with the proposal but separately
so as not to increase the word count of the proposal) 8. A rather long covering letter to
go with email and hard copy versions. If you notice I've missed something please email me!
Thanks to everyone for the their work on this. Very much appreciated. I will let you know
as soon as I hear anything. best wishes Susan ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ Dr Susan Parham
