This is especially important for the Clearwater-area
guys but anyone can do it.
A very nasty article came out in the St. Petersburg
Times today. If you are not going to write this
letter, I would rather you not even read the article.
Even if you're doing the assignment, reading the
article is optional. It's basically just a pack of
falsehoods about how SPs are "victims" because they
have been declared and cut off from their friends and
families. The article neglects to mention the
horrendous suppressive acts that the SPs committed in
order to get declared. They also neglect to mention
that the doors remain open to these people if they
cease their suppressive acts, take responsibility for
what they've done, and make up the damage.
Here's your assignment.
Write a letter to the editor. What we want to do is
"fill the vacuum".
The Times never writes about the Scientology we know,
where lives are saved and relationships are restored
and strengthened. If you have a "miracle" story, write
about that. If you used Scientology to help mend a
broken relationship, that's a good topic.
If you were ever declared an SP and then you recanted
and returned to good standing that is a very good
story.
Don't defend against what the article says, just tell
the truth about your experience in Scientology.
These letters have to be qualed. Send your letter only
to me and I'll get them approved and back to you in a
day or two.
Thank you,
Doyle
