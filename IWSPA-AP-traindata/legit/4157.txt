That would be great, thanks. Ideally I'd like to get some version of notes out this morning and set a meeting/time to discuss with Adam. 
Thanks Michelle. I agree with all your notes and especially cutting cakey. I want to think about any other suggestions for Dennis and will share any specific thoughts tomorrow.
