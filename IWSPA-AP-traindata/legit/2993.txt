Hey Chris,
In Tahiti (w/ Phil), limited email. Thanks so much for the detailed 
response. I also heard from David about this, who had similar. sounds 
like you guys are on top of this. The contrarians will cry conspiracy 
once the spurious plot is taken down and replaced w/ a corrected one, 
but what you can do.
I'm sorry to hear you're retiring from the Met Office, but sounds like 
you're going to remain active, which is great.  lets catch up on things 
sometime soon more generally!
talk to you later,
mike
