Crew,
The situation is worse than we thought in Las Vegas.
Despite numerous letters exposing the truth, the Las
Vegas Sun has now published an editorial and a letter
to the editor both forwarding the same tired
TeenScreen lies that were in the original article we
wrote letters about.
So, send more letters!

You don't need to read the editorial and letter; they
are the same old, same old. Just get the truth out
about TeenSceen.
And report compliance by email.
Thanks!
Best,
Doyle
