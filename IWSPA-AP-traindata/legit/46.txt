Crew,
We haven't had an assignment in a few days. Hope you
guys are rested up and ready for battle.
Your assignment:
1. Read the letter from NAMI published in the Orlando
Sentinel:
<<link>>,0
,4897002.story
TEXT AT THE BOTTOM
If you're not familiar with NAMI, read this
<<link>>
2. Write a letter to the editor and send it to
user@domain.com
You can write what you want, in any tone level, but I
have some suggestions:
-if your last name ends in C-E or M-P, I want you to
attack NAMI directly. You can even avoid the subject
of ADHD if you want and just nail NAMI for being a
paid mouthpiece for drug companies, fraudulently
claiming to be a grass-roots group, etc. See the above
CCHR link if you need more information.
-for other last names, you should attack the
scientific basis for ADHD.
3. And report compliance by email.
Best,
Doyle
