Hails SS Herring,
My trip to MN. was the first amongst a few trips, I did alright in court and
did win some of what I intended, plus served papers on my ex to start the
custody proceedings. However I am getting hit with roadblocks every step of
the way, and have to prove I am not some sort of violent lunatic. It is very
stressfull and is costing Joanna and I alot of time, $$, and stress, plus
time off work and all that. Lawyers and the bs is not cheap as I am sure you
know.
I am pleased to hear of how the NSM has effected you in a positive way, it
always provides me hope and inspiration also, so I know exactly where you
are coming from on that. Salutes 2 you for your efforts. 88
