Dear All,
A lot of good points raised by the horizontal Eystein. Keith is
hoping to do something on the recent tree growth issue.
What this sad crowd (nice words - I'll use the phrase again) don't
realise is that the satellite data now agree with the surface. This is
said in Ch 3 and will come home more forcefully once the CCSP
report on vertical temperature trends comes out. This should be
April or May according to Tom Karl who is overseeing it all. I say
should as it apparently has to be approved by the White House!
Peck will know why this is and the expertise of the people doing
the approval!
I can say for certain (100% - not any probable word that IPCC
would use) is that the surface temperature data are correct.
McIntyre is determined and the blog does influence people, unfortuately
the media.  As you say as issues are partially closed, they will move on
to others.
Cheers
Phil
