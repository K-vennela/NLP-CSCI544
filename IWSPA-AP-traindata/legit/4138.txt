I should also say, Caspar, that I've not forwarded any documents to Philip yet with more
details about the challenge.  I thought that you should do that instead, because you will
have (more likely) kept track of where the latest version is.
Cheers

Hi Caspar,
I forgot to forward to you Philip Brohan's positive response to my invitation for him to be
involved in the production of pseudo-proxy and pseudo-instrumental data for the climate
reconstruction challenge.
It is copied below and you can find his contact details below too.
Best wishes
Tim

Hi Tim.
Thanks for your notes from the workshop. It sounds both interesting and
very positive - I was afraid that the relations between the participants
would break down completely, but you've clearly made good progress.
I think a blind test of reconstruction methods is an excellent idea,
and I'm happy to support it in any capacity. I've done this before with
nuclear fuel performance models, and the results were both alarming and
instructive. Doing it properly won't be easy though, I think several
different stretches of model simulation will be required.
So yes - volunteer me to Caspar (or the organising committee) to make
pseudo-proxy and pseudo-instrumental data.
Philip
