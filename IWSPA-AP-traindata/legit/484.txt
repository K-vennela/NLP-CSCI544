Crew,
This is actually a pretty good article. The subject of
the article is the controversy of TeenScreen. And who
forwards the controversy? We do! So take a win on what
we've done so far and resolve to keep up the fight
until TeenScreen is a side note in the history books
alongside apartheid, slavery, and bloodletting.
Heres your assignment:
1. Read the article at
<<link>>
29/-1/NEWS
(Text at the bottom of this email)
2. Write a letter to the editor and send it to
user@domain.com
You can write what you want but I have some
suggestions:
- Pick out one part of the article that you strongly
agree with or strongly disagree with and write your
letter on just that one subject. Dont try to
summarize everything thats bad with TeenScreen in one
letter.
- If you need more hatting on why TeenScreen is bad
news, click on www.psychsearch.net/teenscreen.html
- A few of us should viciously attack this one point:
Dr. Camaerei states, we don't diagnose, treat or
medicate anyone or recommend any treatment but then
in the next paragraph she states, we suggest to the
students and their families that they be referred to
other MENTAL HEALTH experts... They clearly do
recommend treatment, as they channel the kids toward
mental health treatment, omitting any other
beneficial treatment such as medical doctors,
nutritionists, allergists, tutoring, or religious
programs.
- If your last name ends in A-B, J-M, or S-T, I would
like you to send a copy to user@domain.com
- If your last name ends in B-E, or T-Z, put the link
to the TeenScreen petition in your letter.

Thank you!
