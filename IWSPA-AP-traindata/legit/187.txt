The $452 number is off the latest filing which Jessica pulled this afternoon.   There could be many reasons for the differences.   Many times people pull total receipts which is different from total contributions (raised).   Total receipts can include refunds from vendors, etc.   Raised is the proper number to  use.
There are no states in BVF.   It is up to the candidate to include other members.   Not us.   HFA reached out to the states to invite them in, and they worked to sign them up.  We did nothing.   Bernie has shown no interest in doing anything with the states or with BVF period.
