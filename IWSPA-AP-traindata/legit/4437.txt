Hi again Caspar,
I don't think it is necessary for you to dig through any emails you may have sent us to
determine your answer.
Our question is a more general one, which is whether you generally consider emails that you
sent us to have been sent in confidence.  If you do, then we will use this as a reason to
decline the request.
Cheers
Tim
