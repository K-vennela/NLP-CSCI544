Dear everybody,
I am still busy compiling the report from the kickoff meeting (and I
also still await some input pieces from some of you...).
For those of you who could not be there, let me just say that I
enjoyed very much to see the group here, and to witness the really
lively and productive discussions. Let's keep it that way.
While U wait for the report - I would like to get you thinking about
the project again by circulating the second draft of a small piece
which is edging towards a working definition of vulnerability, mostly
written by Richard and with input from Pete, Miguel and myself. All
comments are welcome. This is not intended for publication of course,
but it could be a start of something more substantial in due course.
So please send me the elements still missing for the overall report,
and comment to the four authors about the vulnerability piece.
Best regards,
Wolfgang
