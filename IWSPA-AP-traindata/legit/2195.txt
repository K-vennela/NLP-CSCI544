Valerie,
Thanks for putting together the chaper so well. I 
think it is quite comprehensive now. I have made 
a few changes in the enclosed document and also 
added a comment( pops up if you mark the yellow 
field).
I tend to like the questions, and think it 
highlights the relevance elements of the chapter.
The missing references I have suggested, we can 
take care of in the final editorial process from 
our side.
As for figures one figure showing the evidence 
for  Holocene warrmt and the abrupt character of 
the 5-4ka cooling, perhaps with a low latitude 
data set that shows another  evolution would be 
good to have, as you indicate, but we cannot 
bombard the chapter with wiggly lines, so the 
most characteristic exampes would be best.
If you need high lat.ocean data I can provide, or 
perhaps NorthGrip O-18 is best?
Cheers,
Eystein
