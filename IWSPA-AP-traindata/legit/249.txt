Thanks Alex,
I think there are a few more folks that I can work with the team to add
into this list.
Of the two names you have on this list, Fred is a big big big dog. He's
probably into HRC world for over a million at this point, perhaps more then
that. Great guy. Very savvy. Hasn't he done $356,100 to HVF? I bet he
considers that his DNC money since 33,400 goes through that to us.
