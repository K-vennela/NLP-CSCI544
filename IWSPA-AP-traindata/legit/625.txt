Keith, Stefan
Its not my role as review editor to tell you what to write, just to make sure you have
responded to the reviewers comments. For what its worth,
I did find Keith's text quite involved.  However, you do need to respond the the reviewers
comments on Burger etc - if the flaws in von Storch paper cast doubt on the subsequent
papers, then why not include a sentence in the chapter that says so, and list just the key
papers affected.
I hope this helps
