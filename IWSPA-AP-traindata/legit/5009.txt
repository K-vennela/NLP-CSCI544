Thanks Tom,
I agree--the issue is not completely settled, and thanks for the reference (any possibility
you can send me a reprint?). The point here of course is that we are talking a potential
effect, w/ as you say, at best a weak signal--hardly the dominating overprint that is
argued by the Idso brothers! (by the way, weren't they a circus act at one point??),
