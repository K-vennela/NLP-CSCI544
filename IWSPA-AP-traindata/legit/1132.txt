HIi Tim,
That all sounds great, and indeed, the 19th century will be a *hot* topic 
(pun intended) as we try to rectify Tom's model response w/ the 
instrumental record and proxy reconstructions. Ironically, the 19th century 
is one in most dispute over the past millennium, it seems!
You accurately summarize what my understanding is of the breakdown of lead 
roles. I don't see any reason for changing that. I think Scott and I will 
have our hands full w/ the other items, so if you can take the lead role on 
the MXD paper (comparing the two methods, etc.) that would be great.
My intention is to give you and Scott full credit for anything I show at 
meetings that is a result of mutual collaboration. Of course, both of your 
are co-authors of my EGS talk.
So all sounds great! Scott: when Tim sends revised plots, can you prepare 
some revised ppt files and let me know when they are available to download? 
Hope to get all this straightened away next week after I return from the 
frozen north (Michigan)...
mike
