So he and Andrea can=E2=80=99t afford one of our packages but are very =
excited to attend their first convention.  I promised them passes each =

give to them. =20

In case you can help automate that =E2=80=93 so they=E2=80=99re waiting =
for them at the central desk each day and I don=E2=80=99t have to =
remember to leave w my hotel concierge, etc., that would be great.  If =
not, no problem.
