Hi Keith,
Of course, I agree with you. We both know the probable flaws in 
Mike's recon, particularly as it relates to the tropical stuff. Your 
response is also why I chose not to read the published version of his 
letter. It would be too aggravating. The only way to deal with this 
whole issue is to show in a detailed study that his estimates are 
clearly deficient in multi-centennial power, something that you 
actually did in your Perspectives piece, even if it was not clearly 
stated because of editorial cuts. It is puzzling to me that a guy as 
bright as Mike would be so unwilling to evaluate his own work a bit 
more objectively.
