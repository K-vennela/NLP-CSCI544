OK.  I agree with her on most. I was looking at the file over the
weekend.  The new 3.8.4 has helped as will the new ones on DTR
when we get them  In the longer run I would like to get 3.7.1 and
3.7.2 redone - at least plotted better.
Also, in time, we will need to get the Sahel plot updated to
have 2004 and 2005 in. Neil Ward was here for a few hours last
week. He's now back at IRI, but he was surprised by the UK
media and their reporting of the famine in Niger -
saying it was all down to lack of rainfall. June in the region
was above normal. Problems last year and locusts are the
reason. The real reason may not matter on the ground, but
the problems will recur as very little is planted this year.
Cheers
