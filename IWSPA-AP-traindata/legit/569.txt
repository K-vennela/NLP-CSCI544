Today's Top StoryDropping the Call: Why Isn't Wireless Investment Soaring?  SHARE: As the end-user desire for faster wireless connection speeds at any time, in every space and with every device becomes a seemingly unquenchable thirst, it seems natural that investment in U.S.-based wireless and broadband technologies would grow. The fact that the total venture capital invested into the wireless communications equipment industry dropped off suddenly in 2013, then, comes as a surprise. From the beginning of 2009 through 2012, the amount of capital invested each year stayed constant, according to the PitchBook Platform, dropping no lower than $216 million and rising no higher than $227 million. In 2013, however, total capital invested fell sharply to $149 million (with $50 million of that total coming in a Series C for Kymeta), even as the deal count stayed on par with the previous four years. 2014 hasn’t gotten off to a stellar start either, as deal count stood at only five with just over $60 million invested, before Mimosa Networks announced its latest financing, a $20 million round.

Completed VC FinancingsIndian E-Commerce Co. Snapdeal Raises $100M to Stay in Race  SHARE:     Snapdeal, an India-based online retailer, has raised $100 million in new funding from Temasek, BlackRock, Myriad, PremjiInvest and Tybourne, bringing its total to-date funding to over $400 million. The new deal comes just months after the company raised $134 million at a $1 billion valuation this past February. Snapdeal is raising all this capital to keep up with the other major e-commerce players in India, notably Amazon and Flipkart. Amazon is quickly ramping up its presence in India, aiming to eventually offer its entire global line of services in the country. Flipkart has raised over $540 million in funding, most recently landing a $360 million Series E round that valued the company at $1.6 billion. It is also in the process of acquiring Indian fashion retailer Myntra for a reported $330 million.
