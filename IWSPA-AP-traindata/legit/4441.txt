Dear Tim,
Thanks for the information. I don't want to speak for Tom Karl, but I think it
may be a bit too late (past the Oct 1 deadline) to make further revisions
in the draft 1.0.  It would be a bit of an imposition on Tom at this point
given what he's been through in finalizing the draft. However, I see no
reason that we can't make that revision when the paper comes back from
expert review in a couple months. We'll have the further advantage that
the supporting  manuscript you describe should be available at that point
(a requirement in the IPCC peer-review process). I think we'll all be
looking forward to updating the plot w/ the latest series you describe... 
As for decisions about the most appropriate baseline period to use for the
series, that is as you point out an important issue and one we have to
consider with some circumspection, especially if a "modern" calibration
(e.g., 1931-1960) to the instrumental record gives a substantially
different alignment
from the more 19th century-oriented calibration you describe. The tradeoff
of course is that the instrumental series itself is considerably less certain
prior to the 20th century while, as you point out, the non-climatic influence
on tree growth may be setting in by the mid 20th century. Something I think
we can iron out satisfactorily at the next juncture.
I hope the above sounds ok to you guys. Let me know. Thanks,
mike
