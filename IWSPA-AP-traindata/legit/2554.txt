Hi all - I'm betting that "provisional acceptance" is not good enough for inclusion in the
Second Order draft, but based on what Gene has said, he should have formal acceptance soon
- we really need that. Can you give us a read on when you'll have it Gene? Best make this a
top priority, or we'll have to leave your important work out of the chapter. Many thanks!!
Peck
Hi Peck, I assume a provisional acceptance is OK by IPCC rules? The timing of these
matters are being followed closely by  McIntyre (see:
<<link>>) and we cannot afford to being caught doing anything
that is not within the regulations. Thus need to consult with martin and Susan on this
(see also last mail from Melinda).
Cheers,
Eystein
Thanks Gene - it is worth all the effort, and please keep us (especially Keith) posted
on the updates.
best, peck

Thread-Topic: Wahl-Ammann paper on MBH-MM issues

Hello Jonathan and Keith:
I'm not sure that I ever sent you the updated Wahl-Ammann paper that was the basis for
Steve's provisional acceptance.  Here it is.  As is, it contains a long appendix (# 1)
on issues with interannual statistics of merit for validation, which was not in the
version I had sent you earlier in the year.  All the main results and conclusions are
the same.
Caspar and I are also now responding to Steve's final requests, based on independent
re-review.  This is primarily to address publishing Pearson's r^2 and CE calculations
for verification, which Steve and the reviewer reason should be done to get the
conversation off the topic of us choosing not to report these measures, and onto the
science itself.  We explain thoroughly in the appendix I mention above why we feel these
(and other interannual-only) measures of merit are not of much use for verification in
the MBH context, so that the fact we are reporting them is contextualized appropriately.
IN FACT, we will be going farther than that and will be bringing this material
currently in an appendix into the main text, based on the reasoning below(quoted from
another message)
Caspar mentioned yesterday that he talked with Susan Solomon about this paper, and she
did not see the appendix we had added concerning the issues about Pearson's r^2 etc.
Based on this she therefore thought our text was weak in this area in relation to
McIntyre's criticisms.  Caspar thought, and I agree, that we need to bring this stuff
OUT of the appendix and get it INTO the methods section, so that it won't be so easily
missed!!  We are working on this--which will include other material as well in the text
proper.
Also, we are going ahead with an even further-expanded discussion on the issues with
r^2, which itself will probably become an appendix in the final text (it had been slated
for publication as supplemental web-site material).  This expanded discussion will go
into additional reasoning (with graphics) concerning the basis for r^2 not being useful
in this context.  It will give a vector space analysis of the issues, and explicit
visual demonstration of how these issues with r^2 play out in terms of false negative
and false positive errors in validation.
Let me know if I can be of any further help in all this.  Apologies if this message
seems long.  I did my best to keep it short, but I'm a bit tired and it is hard to edit
well in that state!
Peace, Gene
