Kevin,
Homogeneity only done on mean T. Lots of sites just measure this.
A lot will measure max and min, but I haven't got the data. I also
didn't want to get into max/min as what is relevant to urban-related
warming in the global land series (or China) is the effects on mean T.
I can't then look at max or min against a rural series.
I would expect max to have changed less than min, but I can't
really look at that.
Also I don't want to confuse readers by saying there is an urban-related
temp influence, but it is to a lower DTR. I guess I could refer to Vose et al
(our Fig 3.11) which does show a decrease in DTR for 79-04 over China
(mostly blues).
I'll work on the text.
Cheers
Phil
