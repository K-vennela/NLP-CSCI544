Hi Peck and Eystein,
Here a reduced version of Box 6.2, taking into account suggestions from David
and Bette. The text is now 1.5 pages, i.e. just slightly above target. The
entire Box should now fit on less than 1 IPCC page (Assigned 0.75 page).
I am willing to take the next effort to shorten when the review comments of the
FOD are in.
With best regards,
Fortunat
