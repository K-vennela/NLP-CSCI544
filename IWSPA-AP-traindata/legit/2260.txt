Hi Ed and Keith
for your information, I attached the revision of the EOS article. In 
this version we added some lines about the data-overlap between the 
MBH and ECS records.
I also attached a figure showing a comparison between MBH and 
EsperFULL (using all data) and EsperSUB (without Tornetraesk and the 
Polar Urals).
Take care
Jan
