THE BIG IDEA:
As she campaigns in Kentucky ahead of Tuesday=E2=80=99s primary, Hillary Cl=
inton has repeatedly slammed Republican Gov. Matt Bevin on everything from =
health care to education.
The businessman, elected unexpectedly last fall with promises to shake up F=
rankfort, has signaled that he wants to dismantle the state health exchange=
set up by his Democratic predecessor and move Kentuckians into the insuran=
ce market managed by the federal government. He=E2=80=99s in negotiations w=
ith the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
When Clinton brings up Bevin at rallies, Democratic crowds boo. =E2=80=9CI =
am saddened by what I hear may come out of the governor=E2=80=99s office he=
re in Kentucky,=E2=80=9D she said in Louisville this week.
She even went to a family health center in Louisville to talk with doctors =
and draw attention to the issue. =E2=80=9CI have to tell you, it just broug=
ht tears to my eyes,=E2=80=9D she recalled to a crowd later in the day. =E2=
=80=9CPeople who are getting health care for the first time in years =E2=80=
=A6 and it is so distressing to me when anybody in public life, who has all=
the health care he or she needs, wants to take it away from poor people, w=
orking poor people, small business people, and others who don=E2=80=99t hav=
e the health care they need.=E2=80=9D
Bill Clinton knocked Bevin yesterday during a three-city swing across the B=
luegrass State, and his wife plans to do so again when she returns on Sunda=
y and Monday.
As she tries to finish off Bernie Sanders, this is a play to the base that =
dovetails nicely with Hillary=E2=80=99s broader strategy <<<link>>

Bevin, in an interview with the 202, pushed back strongly against the Clint=
ons. He argues that he=E2=80=99s not trying to take health coverage from an=
yone but working to make care more affordable and accessible. =E2=80=9CAn i=
nsurance card does not make you healthy,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CYou can=
crow about expanding this and that, but it doesn=E2=80=99t matter if you d=
on=E2=80=99t improve outcomes. =E2=80=A6 And at the end of the day, it does=
have to be paid for. It=E2=80=99s not cheap.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CThe Clintons have been surrounded by corruption their entire polit=
ical lives,=E2=80=9D the governor said. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t use the te=
rm corruption lightly. =E2=80=A6 Go back to Arkansas and follow the trail. =
=E2=80=A6 Go back to Whitewater. Look at the foundations. Look at the pay t=
o play.=E2=80=9D
Bevin is a self-made millionaire who owns several businesses. =E2=80=9CPeop=
le like them have become extremely wealthy by milking their connections,=E2=
=80=9D he complained.
He also said Clinton attacks him on health care so that the media does not =
cover her gaffe about putting lots of coal miners out of work. =E2=80=9CShe=
wants to destroy a key part of our state,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CShe w=
ants to see coal wiped off the face of the Earth.=E2=80=9D
"Gov. Bevin can resort to personal attacks, but Hillary Clinton is going to=
remain focused on laying out how she'll fight for Kentucky families as pre=
sident,=E2=80=9D her spokesman Ian Sams responded. =E2=80=9CHer commitment =
to tackling the challenges that young and working families face in accessin=
g affordable health care and child care is quite a contrast with a Republic=
an governor intent on taking away people's health insurance and cutting cri=
tical funding for higher education."
