Hi Ellen,
I'm still travelling, and have only intermittent email access. I'm pretty sure Phil is
travelling now too, so I'm hoping Keith or Tim can help out here.
I think we actually discussed two small changes from the final version Phil sent you. This
involved adding Malcolm Hughes as a co-author (his name was accidentally left off the
list), and changing the wording of one sentence slightly. I believe that Tim and Keith have
these changes, and hopefully they can submit this via GEMS? If not, will have to wait until
Phil or I have a solid internet connection to do this (that will likely be at IUGG in
Sapporo in about 2 weeks).
Thanks for bringing this to our attention. Phil--if you're reading email, any way you can
help out here?
thanks all,
mike
