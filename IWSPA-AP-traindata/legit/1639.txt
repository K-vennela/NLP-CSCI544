Ben,
Thanks for the plots and keeping me up to date. The ERA-40/CRU comparisons
are quite interesting. I'm hopeful Adrian will write up a summary for publication in
addition
to an ECMWF report.
This sort of thing is important wrt IPCC and also papers such as Kalnay and Cai.
I'm also working with Russ Vose and others at NCDC to get a comparison of CRU/GHCN
and NASA datasets in GRL. NCDC have used their first difference technique with CRU
data. Differences are very, very small due to data and the technique doesn't matter much
either. All seems to boil down to how the global average is defined. Calculated as one
domain as NCDC (and until recently the HC as well) want to do it, it is biased to the NH.
If you do it the CRU way (G=0.5(NH+SH)) then it looks much more like an OA version
of HadCRUT2v that the HC have just produced.  Been saying this for years as has Tom,
so no surprises. Finally got the HC to realise it, now just need to convince NCDC.
NCDC will also have a new 5 by 5 deg gridded dataset of Tx and Tn soon, right up to
the present. Need to compare this with ERA-40.
Cheers
Phil
