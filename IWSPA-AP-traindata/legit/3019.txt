Mike,
We'll differ a bit on a few points, but let's wipe the slate
clean and get back to improving our estimates of past changes
over the last millennium.
I must admit to having little regard for the Web. Living over
here makes that easier than in the US - but I would ignore the
so-called skeptics until they get to the peer-review arena. I know
this is harder for you in the US and it might become harder still
at your new location. I guess it shows though that what we are
doing in important. The skeptics are fighting a losing battle.
Cheers
Phil
