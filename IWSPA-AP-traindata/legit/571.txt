Dear Keith,
I wish I could say that updating the Russian data is on the front burner for
us right now, but I'm afraid it's not.  I'm having to plan some proposals and
have been pulled off part of my normal CDIAC work for about 6 months to work
on a special project.  And in our small group, I'm the only climate guy (and
the one that has done the Russian work thus far).  Thus, the first suggestion
I have is to discuss the data with NCDC; perhaps the best person to start
with would be Pasha Groisman.  Years ago, when I did the Russian work, the
data were actually transferred from Russia to NCDC and then on to us, so I
wouldn't be surprised if NCDC was holding updated data or at least could get
ahold of data relatively easily.  Perhaps you've already corresponded
directly w/Slava Razuvaev or one of his colleagues at RIHMI-WDC?  I'm afraid
it's been quite a while since I've spoken w/Slava.
Wait, maybe there is another way....  I've just remembered about NCDC's Global
Daily Climate Network:

I have not learned much about these holdings, but if you check it out perhaps
they've incorporated more recent data daily into this database for the FSU.
I sure hope so.
I'm sorry that I cannot be of more help at this time.  With any luck CDIAC can
turn its attention to updates of these data in 2005.
Regards,
Dale
