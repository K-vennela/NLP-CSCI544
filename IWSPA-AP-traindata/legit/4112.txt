Dear Keith,
Do not be embarassed. This  situation is very humorous and I am very
glad to smile. It happens.
Thank you very much for your time series.
I would like  to analyse  specta characteristics  of  summer temperatures ( your
series) and winter  temperature series  using Dansgaard's time series  for
the same period ( since 550s). It seems to me    the temperature data of Arctic basin is
the
most pronounced indices illustrating of   long term climate oscillations.
Best wishes
Leonid
