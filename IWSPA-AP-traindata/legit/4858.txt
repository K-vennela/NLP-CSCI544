Bo and others:
Regarding the annual data: You're correct that we only use 10-year means throughout our
calculations (Fig 2 shows annual values, but are not used in any calculation/conclusion).
In his e-mail to me, McIntyre requested the annual data that we say are not publicly
available as a footnote to Table S1.
Unless anyone has another suggestion, I will reply and send him the 10-year data (which is
already posted at NOAA-Paleoclimate) and explain that they were the basis for all of the
calculations. He might want the annual data that the mean values were based on. I suppose
we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
