Hi Gene - good to hear from you. What you list below seems like it 
must be pretty good to me. Of course, we'd like to include all we can 
in the FOD, hence the interest in knowing if it's in press or not 
before the end of the month.
Just keep us updated, and if you feel comfortable sharing the ms. 
that'd be great, but only if you feel ok about sharing it. The key 
people are me, Eystein Jansen and Keith Briffa - we won't share it 
with others.
Thanks for keeping us up to date. Best, peck
