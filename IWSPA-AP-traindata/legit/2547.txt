Bobby-
Hope all is well.
I am trying to track down a donor photo from President Obama's visit to Atlanta on March 29th during the clutch before his speech on addiction. The photo is of donors Javarro Edwards and his wife Tiffany Cochran Edwards with POTUS and if you could please help me find a digital copy of the picture that would be a huge help.
Photo of them is attached.
Thank you!
Clayton
