TO: Jordan and Claire Please see Sen. Gillibrand's positive response to =
the Convention idea co-hosted by WLF, "Off the Sidelines", and hopefully Ah=
mal & George Clooney.
Kirsten G. is willing to move forward, and based on the original response f=
rom the Clooneys thru our mutual friend, Jae Kim, we think there's a real c=
hance it can happen with all=C2=A0principals taking part.=C2=A0=20
To do:=C2=A0 Please assemble=C2=A0 a "Fact Sheet" on the event from the DNC=
, including all details=C2=A0known at this time.
NOTE:=C2=A0 ref: timing -- Carol & I spoke with Emily Berman and Stefanie C=
onahan (Kirsten's staff) today and based on Kirsten's Convention schedule, =
we would need to have the event=C2=A0 WEDNESDAY, (not Tuesday), approximate=
ly 10:30AM-Noon ,so as to avoid the EMILY's List event that afternoon at 3-=
5PM.=C2=A0 That is the only change from what was originally outlined (not y=
et knowing the Clooneys' schedule, of course).
We look forward to hearing from you ASAP.Thanks!Cynthia and Carol
