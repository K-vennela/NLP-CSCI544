Hi Lena,
Jordan forwarded me your email and I did some digging. Ann has not received a package through the DNC. It's possible she purchased a package elsewhere or perhaps it was from the State party. To the best of our knowledge no physical credentials have been sent out yet on the DNC side. Do you know where she claims she got the package or credentials from?
Thanks,
Alex
