Drafting a Contract:=20
Four-Session Series on Key Terms,=20
Common Issues and Resolving Disputes
Four webinars designed to thoroughly detail the contract-drafting process=20
and ensure your contracts protect your employer's interests.
Most business relationships are memorialized by a written contract. Extreme=
care must be exercised to ensure that what appears on the printed page acc=
urately reflects the wishes of the parties and provides sufficient safeguar=
ds for your employer should an issue arise. Too often, however, parties rus=
h into signing a contract or attorneys recycle old agreements that may incl=
ude terms that do not reflect the needs of the parties or the specifics of =
the particular deal. This can lead to trouble down the road should a disput=
e arise, meaning that careful contract drafting and understanding the contr=
act's various components are imperative to preserve and protect your employ=
er's interests.
FOUR COMPREHENSIVE SESSIONS!
This comprehensive program consists of:
=B7=A0Practical training and guidance taught by an industry expert
=B7=A04 training sessions available on CD
=B7=A0Presentation slides for your future reference
Please join Dr. Jim Castagnera, Esq., for this four-part series as he cover=
s common characteristics of many contracts and issues to consider when draf=
ting your agreement to help you ensure that what appears in the written doc=
ument reflects your employer's needs should something go wrong.
