A lot of it. But what's even better than having a vast amount of data is being able to make sense of it. One of the many ways we're doing this is by scouring the 20,000+ VC round valuations we track and identifying which have seen the most significant jumps recently—not in terms of total value but in terms of size multiple. This allows us to dig up some of the fastest-growing companies that likely aren't headlining news stories across the internet (just yet). Below are 10 companies that experienced the largest growth during February according to their pre-money valuation step-up multiples, a metric obtained by dividing a company's current valuation by the valuation of its previous round.
