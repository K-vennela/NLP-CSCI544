Comrades,
The NSM Town Hall meeting with the Public is only days away, make plans to
be there. NSM members from around the Midwest will be there, and we expect
an excellent turnout. Contact NSM Wisconsin Division right away if you plan
on attending. All NSM Party members, and friends/allies of the Party are
also welcome to attend the Social gathering after the public meeting. Make
plans to be in the Milwaukee area on Nov. 10th.
