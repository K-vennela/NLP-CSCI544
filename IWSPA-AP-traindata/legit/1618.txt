[Mitchell, John FB]  3.471 in longwave, 3.26 when shortwave also
taken into account. Unfortunately modellers do not always make clear how
they have estimated their CO2 forcing.
[Mitchell, John FB]  HadCM2 is 1%/year increase in CO2 which is only
approximately equivalent to IS92a. Hadcm 3 is "95a" - in fact "95a" I think
differs only from in the conversion of the 92a emissions to concentrations,
so strictly speaking is not an emissions scenario. As far as I know, Tom
never did explain why his concentrations in 1995 were different form the
ones Jonathan and I derived using his 1992 model- I think CH4 liffetimes and
the CO2 sink were the main factors. 
[Mitchell, John FB]  See above - HadCM2 uses 1%/year increase in
CO2, which gives a greater forcing than HadCM3, even after the effect of
explicit trace gases is added in.
(about 0.5Wm-2 by 2100). The greater climate sensitivity does not
make as big a difference as one would expect. The difference in CO2 forcing
per doubling is not the issue- the net forcing is, and that has ben
calculated taking the difference in CO2 response into account
M aybe I have misinterpreted something here.
