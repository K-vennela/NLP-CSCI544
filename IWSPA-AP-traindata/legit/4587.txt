as per our conversation last week  as many" three monsters and a baby" jokes  we can  get into the movie the better and ditto  the idea fof mavis  as  the overprotective mom  in  a monster castle but also  a cool  mom. stuff  like dracula  repeatedly flying intot he wall  and the baby proofing .,  the baby seat ect...maybe we should go  through the script  and pick  out all  the set pieces and  comedy and  make  sure we have what we need
we should  make sure  we have enough big moments  for  marketing as we finish the movie
