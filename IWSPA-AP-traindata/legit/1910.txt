Hi Caspar,
Thanks for the comments. Frankly, Von storch is being duplicitous here. 
He may tell certain audiences (like the NCAR group last month) that he 
is not suggesting that the GKSS simulation is reealistic, because he 
knows he'll get skewered if he claims othewise. But then he turns around 
to the press, and talks about how the Moberg et al reconstruction 
matches their model, etc.  I  frankly consider this dishonest, at best!
If what Stefan says is true (that the entire long-term trend, including 
the cold LIA in the model, is all due to the spinup problem), then it 
completely invalidates the use of that model for testing statistical 
reconstruction methodologies which require physically-consistent 
patterns of variance in the calibration period to reconstruct the past. 
But that's a separate issue.
As we now know, the far more damning fact is that Von Storch et al 
knowingly applied a procedure which is not the MBH98 procedure, and they 
think they can get away w/ admitting this now in some obscure Italian 
journal which isn't even in the ISI database.   Tim/Phil/Keith: you may 
not know about the latter, but Caspar should be able to fill you in on 
this shortly...
Meanwhile, lets enjoy the media fiesta on MSU...
Mike
