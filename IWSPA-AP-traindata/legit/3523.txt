RECENT NEWS\
*         A tape has been released of Arizona Senator John McCain at a private fundraiser in Arizona last month warning of a Donald Trump nomination<<<link>>>. In the tape, McCain said that if Trump is the GOP Presidential nominee, he has "no doubt that this may be the race of [his] life." He particularly cited the backlash in the Hispanic community against Trump.
*         The governor of California on Wednesday approved raising the legal age<<<link>>#incart_river_index> to buy tobacco for smoking, dipping, chewing and vaping from 18 to 21. Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown said he signed the measure along with four others restricting tobacco use in various ways. In April, Hawaii became the first state in the nation to raise the legal smoking age to 21 and more than 100 local jurisdictions around the country have made the change, including New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
*         The latest attempt to overhaul how money is doled out to school districts across Illinois stalled Wednesday after Gov. Bruce Rauner<<<link>>> threw cold water on the plan<<<link>>>, despite doubts the measure had enough support to reach his desk in the first place. At issue is a proposal pushed by Sen. Andy Manar, D-Bunker Hill, to rewrite the state's school aid formula following years of complaints that districts less able to prop up their bottom line with property tax money are falling farther behind those flush with property tax dollars.
*         Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse published a Facebook post this morning<<<link>>> where he laid out his argument for a one-term, problem-solver candidate. Sasse has been a vocal critic of Trump, but, even after a Draft Sasse PAC urged him to get in the race as a third party candidate, has shut down all attempts to get him to run. Instead, he is using his platform to encourage others to run.

ELECTION CLIPS
2016 - Presidential
Democratic Party Candidates
Hillary Clinton
Clinton's dilemma: To punch or not to punch<<<link>>>
Hillary Clinton's advisers have one big warning for her as she prepares to run against Donald Trump: Don't get trampled like Jeb Bush. Top operatives in Clinton's Brooklyn headquarters have studied closely the various strategies deployed by the Republicans felled by Trump - including that of the former Florida governor, whose passivity in the face of Trump's taunts and insults doomed his once-inevitable seeming campaign. They also took notes as Sen. Marco Rubio tried and failed to match Trump in an unflattering game of personal insults.
Hillary Clinton's new ads use Republican leaders-and Donald Trump himself-to bash Trump<<<link>>>
After Donald Trump's convincing win in the Republican party's Indiana state primary this week-and the departure of his main rival Ted Cruz from the race-it appears he really will be Hillary Clinton's rival for the US presidency, however surreal it might still be to some. (His victory has many Republicans leaving the party, and even burning their voter registration cards.) For Clinton, the question now becomes how to best attack Trump. Luckily for her, recent months have provided plenty of fodder. In two early attack ads, she's letting Trump himself, and his Republican detractors, do the work for her-without Clinton herself appearing once in either ad.
Bernie Sanders
Bernie Sanders in the Democratic race "until the last vote is cast"<<<link>>>
The Democratic race is just about over. Bernie Sanders won Indiana Tuesday night, but essentially split the delegates with Hillary Clinton, who now has 92 percent of the delegates she needs for the nomination. But Sanders told "CBS Evening News" anchor Scott Pelley he's not going anywhere -- he's staying in the race until the very end.
Republican Party Candidates
Donald Trump
Donald Trump Reaches Out, Quietly, to Republican Establishment<<<link>>>
Donald J. Trump, turning his attention to the general election, has begun quietly reaching out to key elements of the Republican establishment as he seeks to unite the party behind his candidacy before his anticipated battle against Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump, who is expected to run on a nonideological platform of his own design, is trying to reassure party officials that he understands there are certain norms even he needs to follow as the Republican nominee, and that he is capable of producing an organization and infrastructure that can sustain a costly general election campaign. His team, already working to transform a lean operation into a national presidential campaign apparatus, has been reaching out to members of Congress and Washington think tanks; strategizing on how best to take on Mrs. Clinton and woo supporters of her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and planning to head to Cleveland next week to help direct the party's July convention, according to aides.
Donald Trump hints at changing stance on minimum wage<<<link>>>
Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that he would be open to lifting the minimum wage, switching his previous primary campaign stance that the U.S. could not afford to hike the current federal rate of $7.25 per hour. Asked specifically if he was "open to raising the minimum wage" during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Trump responded: "I am open to doing something with it, because I don't like that." "But," he added, "what I really do like is bring our jobs back so they're making much more than the 15 dollars."
Sen. Ben Sasse isn't done with Donald Trump. Not hardly.<<<link>>>
Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) has said what many other GOP senators and officials undoubtedly wanted to say but have opted not to: Donald Trump could be a disaster for both the GOP and the country. Sasse is still the only sitting GOP senator to say he simply won't vote for Trump under any circumstances. And now, even as many who labeled the now-presumptive nominee all manner of things -- including "unstable" and "dangerous" -- say they would somehow still prefer a man with those deficits to Hillary Clinton, Sasse isn't backing off.
