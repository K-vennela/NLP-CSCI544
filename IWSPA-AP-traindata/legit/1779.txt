Hi Gabi,
Here is the section from the FOD draft that includes the new PMIP-2
results.  The radiative forcings have been modified based on new
calculations.  Note the PMIP-2 LGM model results included in the FOD
do not include vegetation or atmospheric aerosol changes so for 
these results the radiative forcing estimate is 5.7 +/- 1.3 W/m2.
