Hails ST. 1st Class Herring,
Going back on the 12th is probably the best plan if you ride back with me,
however there is another guy from Minnesota, a new member that is meeting us
out there, he has room for riders too if you want to get a ride back with
him in time for the 11th. His name is Chris # 320-260-5105. I already asked
him if he wanted to share a room with you Friday and he is up for that. I
have not met him yet, but he sounds really gung ho, he even said that he
would not charge any of his riders gas if they were short on funds. I will
match that, and do not expect any gas from you for the ride out there. I
will see you Thursday evening, should be a great trip and event. Don't worry
about speaking, you will do just fine, I am going to do an overview of my
speech topics Thursday night, after I pick you up. 88
