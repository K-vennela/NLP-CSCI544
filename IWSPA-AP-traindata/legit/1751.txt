to be honest I haven't checked a lot of his work lately, this is the first salary file for awhile so I'm not to sure, he has improved over the last couple of months but I still think in a lot of cases he goes for the quick solution
as for that other thing she is the dumbest f'kn c**t - if she scratches one more time whilst talking to me I'm going to throw my new fan at her. I offered to help her with a prepayment calc after 5 on Friday because I thought it would be easy and save Mark on Monday - so I had a look at the calc sheet an the dates were different on the sheet from the kit paperwork, she was running a quote at different date, the spreadsheet then didn't have all the testing info like greater off benefits, to me she is just wasting my time and everyone else's because she/it has no idea
the whole time she just sat there scratching her hands
