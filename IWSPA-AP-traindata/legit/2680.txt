Dear Phil,
I looked at some of the stuff on the Climate Audit web site. I'd really 
like to talk to a few of these "Auditors" in a dark alley. They seem to 
have no understanding of how science is actually done - no appreciation 
of the fact that uncertainty is an integral part of what we do. Once 
again, just let me know how I can help....
It will be good to see you in Exeter. I'm looking forward to that. I'll 
have two nights in London after the meeting, and am hoping to spend some 
time wandering around the British Museum.
I met a very nice lady (Stephanie) while I was giving a series of 
climate change lectures in Puerto Rico back in January. She's a 
Professor at the University of San Francisco, and (fortuitously), 
specializes in the policy implications of climate change, risk 
assessment, etc. She also likes hiking and climbing. It's fun to "have a 
life" again (as they say over here).
Best wishes to you and Ruth,
Ben
