HI Hans,
Yes--it was the discussion of this in the De Bilt meeting report that led 
me to think this was envisioned in a broadened version of the DATUN 
approach.  I thought the idea was that you would eventually use a forward 
biological/physical model to scale up from a given proxy an estimate of say 
precipitation or temperature for an atmospheric model gridpoint and use 
that to nudge  say the slp  or 500 mb field into a particular 
configuration. This is clearly more ambitious than what you are doing now, 
and  I suppose I was blurring the distinct efforts of  Nanne and colleagues 
with that of yours and colleagues. I makes much more sense at present to 
only use a statistically-based upscaling of the proxy data. The  other 
possibility remains intriguing, but we are certainly far off from doing 
that in my opinion as well. I'm actually quite relieved to find out that I 
was wrong in assuming that this is the direction the DATUN approach was going.
thanks for the clarification,
mike
