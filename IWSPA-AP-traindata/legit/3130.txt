Dear Rick, Keith and Eystein,
It is certainly good news that FP6 will have a climate change and paleo
related call.  My personal feeling is that whatever paleo proposal(s)
eventually do go in that it would be a good thing to specifically include
the PAGES office in Bern as a participant in the network. This would, I
believe, help the network by providing an international context and the many
PAGES resources for outreach within Europe, and inclusion of non-europeans.
On the other side of the coin, PAGES is currently seeking to broaden our
support base beyond USA and Switzerland and participation in an EU framework
proposal would be an ideal way to do this, given the strong representation
of European scientists within the PAGES community. If, however, you have
reason to believe that explicit inclusion of the PAGES office in the list of
partner organizations would reduce the chance of success of such a proposal,
then of course don't do it. Basically, I would much appreciate being kept in
the loop with your plans and am happy to participate, and offer the help of
PAGES, in any way I that you deem useful.
Keith
