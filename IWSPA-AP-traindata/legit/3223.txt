STILL VOTING HERE: Here we go again. Kentucky and Oregon Democrats vote tonight. Collectively, they'll give BERNIE SANDERS the chance to pick up two more victories. But - stop us if you've heard this before - they likely won't change his ability to win in the big race against HILLARY CLINTON.
POLITICO's Steve Shepard looks at where Sanders must win to beat Clinton in Kentucky tonight. <<link>> He'll have to outperform her in more rural areas. Sanders is also favored in Oregon, where a more homogeneous and liberal electorate favors him.
What this amounts to for Clinton is potential for more embarrassment. As POLITICO's Daniel Strauss reports, even a pair of losses are unlikely to change her path to the Democratic nomination. Her supporters, though, are wondering when this will end. <<link>> 
It's Tuesday. Turn on some Bluegrass and enjoy yet another primary night in America. Oh, and here's your 2016 Blast. Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through the day's campaign news, so send your tips, complaints and best cockpit chatter to: user@domain.com. 
2) STAFFING TRUMP TOWER: DONALD TRUMP's general election plans are taking some shape. POLITICO's Marc Caputo reports Trump, who has eschewed pollsters, hired Tony Fabrizio, a Florida-based operative. <<link>> And POLITICO's Kenneth P. Vogel and Alex Isenstadt report Trump is creating a fairly complex fundraising system that would establish two separate fundraising committees that will let him solicit mega donations to help down-ticket GOP candidates. Collectively, these two stories show the same thing: Trump's operation is putting thought and structure into its strategy for November. <<link>> 
3) GENERAL PRACTICES: As we know, HILLARY CLINTON's still seeing off a Democratic challenger. But her allies are eyes-ahead, looking at the looming (Trump) tower. POLITICO's Gabriel Debenedetti looks at how that's taking shape: by pushing voters to learn more about DONALD TRUMP. <<link>> A new series of ads unloads on Trump, targeting his treatment of women. <<link>> And an appearance by Clinton's top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, offered a window into how the Clinton campaign will target Trump on foreign policy: As an unstable and inconsistent voice who would sow chaos. <<link>> 
4) PHILLY WARNING? There was chaos at the Nevada conventions, and the fear among Democrats is that what happens there won't stay there. As POLITICO's Daniel Strauss and Sarah Wheaton report that DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz is calling on BERNIE SANDERS and HILLARY CLINTON to denounce chaos that unfolded over the weekend in Nevada. <<link>> Harry Reid called it a "test of leadership" for Sanders. <<link>> But Sanders didn't see it the same way: He issued a statement this afternoon railing against party leaders for Nevada and blaming their tactics for chaos. <<link>> 
BLAST-ROUND: Just catching up?: A group of angry Sanders supporters were so unruly this weekend that a Las Vegas hotel shutdown the state convention. More protesters descended on the state Democratic Party headquarters the next day. <<link>>
5) BETTER TO BERN OUT THAN TO FADE AWAY: A pair of potential victories in Oregon and Kentucky likely won't speed up BERNIE SANDERS' exit from the Democratic race. But there were still some clues about his endgame today: First, a sign he isn't planning to pull his punches on the way out. Campaigning in San Juan, Puerto Rico Sanders questioned HILLARY CLINTON's judgement in appointing her husband, former President Bill Clinton, as her "economy czar." <<link>> And yet, there are signs Sanders sees an end, including word of yet more staff leaving Sanders' campaign operation, per POLITICO's Gabriel Debenedetti. Among the departures: his top technology
officer and three California aides. <<link>> 
TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Mitch McConnell gives a nudge. DONALD TRUMP is a polling menace. His lawyer drops a lawsuit before it starts. J.K. Rowling defends him. Sort of. The actor who played Bunk attempts to debunk. HILLARY CLINTON is big in Albania. Marshawn Lynch keeps Bill Clinton in check and Clinton county isn't Clinton Country. 
SENATORIAL SUBTLETY: Mitch McConnell says that DONALD TRUMP not releasing his taxes would be a "break with tradition." But doesn't, you know, demand he release them either. <<link>> 
TRUMPING DATA: DONALD TRUMP has already, and will continue to, cause really big issues for pollsters. <<link>> 
A PANTS SUIT: A DONALD TRUMP lawyer retracts his threat to sue The New York Times. <<link>> 
FAIR ENOUGH: A spokeswoman for DONALD TRUMP notes, while pushing back on stories about his treatment of women, that his own wife has endorsed him. <<link>> 
DEFENDING SLYTHERINS: Author J.K. Rowling of Harry Potter fame deeply dislikes DONALD TRUMP but defends his right to speak his mind. (Vanity Fair). <<link>> 
BUNK DEBUNKS: Actor Wendell Pierce of The Wire fame took to Twitter to dispel rumors after he was arrested following an argument with BERNIE SANDERS supporters. (Mediaite) <<link>> 
BLAST NOTE: The Blast does not like to rank its favorites, but if think you have an argument for why any show is better than The Wire, we're all ears.
FROM ALBANY TO ALBANIA: An Albanian city is putting up a bust of HILLARY CLINTON to honor her role in helping the country. (CBS) <<link>> 
DRAG RACE: This is a story about drag queens competing to be the next HILLARY CLINTON. (Mashable) <<link>> 
BEAST MODE: The time Marshawn Lynch made Bill Clinton throw down a north Oakland hand signal before he'd take a photo with him. <<link>> 
STRUGGLES IN 'CLINTON' COUNTRY: HILLARY CLINTON has lost eight "Clinton" counties so far. (ABC) <<link>> 
WHAT'S NEXT: Voting is HAPPENING NOW in Oregon and Kentucky. BERNIE SANDERS decamps for Northern California tomorrow with stops in Vallejo and San Jose. 
THEY SAID IT: "He's not Hitler." - Melania Trump, talking about her husband, DONALD TRUMP. <<link>> 
MAGIC NUMBER: 3. That's HILLARY CLINTON's lead over DONALD TRUMP in a new NBC News/Survey Monkey poll - Clinton's margin is already two points smaller than it was last week. <<link>>
