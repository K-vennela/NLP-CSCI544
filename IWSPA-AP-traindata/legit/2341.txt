NSM Leaders and Party Members,
By now you have all recieved the Summer issue of NSM Magazine, and the magazine staff is busy putting together the Falll issue now. 
Any NSM unit Leaders, or writers that want to submit articles or updates on what your Chapter of the NSM has been busy doing, you have 2 weeks from today to get those articles in. We do not guarantee that everyone that writes something will get it published, but we will consider all submissions. Also anyone with cover or graphics art, a newly createdÂ leaflet, etc. is welcome to submit them also. 
The NSM and its various Offices all consist of team efforts. You (the members and supporters) are that team. Thank you Comrades. 88 Commander Schoep/ www.nsm88.com
