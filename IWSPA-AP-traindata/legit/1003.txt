Dear Sarah,
Ben and I have had some long discussions about this paper, and I have
made quite a few changes as a consequence. Most of these are minor --
but I realized that my statement that the peak cooling depended
logarithmically on the sensitivity was potentially confusing. For this to be
the case one has to have a relationship like
Tmax = A + B ln(S)
which implies odd results for very low sensitivity. Instead, I have fitted
a relationship of the form
Tmax = A [S**n]
which gives Tmax = 0 when S = 0.
I have fitted a similar relationship to the decay time results, and I have
done the same for the LG98 results. All this information has been added
to the manuscript. It helps in understanding the differences between us and
LG98.
I had hoped to send this off earlier this week, i.e., before I go to Buenos
Aires (tomorrow), but I never received the copyright form from you. Then
I remembered that you were at that IPCC meeting in Ireland. So I have
asked Liz Rothney to send the ms off next week as soon as she gets the
copyright form from you. So please fax this back (303 497 1333) as soon
as possible.
Best wishes,
Tom.
