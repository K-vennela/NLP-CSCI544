HI Tim,
THanks for looking into this so quickly. I agree w/ your assessment. It is 
probably just the fact that the signal of interest in SOI and NINO3 is 
really the interannual signal, and this is not evident in the low-frequency 
component shown, which emphasizes discrepancies that are actually small 
compared to amplitude of the interannual signal present in both Stahle et al 
and Mann et al. So I would urge showing the annual reconstructions in this 
case, rather than smoothed for this reason...
In IPCC we only chose to show 1700 to present, which is a better 
calibrated/verified interval than back to 1650, so I'd encourage you guys to 
restrict it to 1700-present if you can. Other than that,
I think it is important to acknowledge that SOI and NINO3 have different 
low-frequency trends over the 20th century, and might well have different 
trends in the past. It is true that many of the proxies used are sensitive 
to the SOI (e.g. mexican tree rings), but others are sensitive to Pacific 
SST (e.g. corals from GBR, New Caledonia, Galapagos) and our claim is that 
the calibration process will select out the best estimate of the temperature 
patterns, rather than SLP patterns, associated w/ ENSO, from the multiproxy 
network. In the future, we'll be going after SLP reconstruction too, and 
it'll be interesting to see what the difference is.
I hope that clarifies. Please let me know if I can be of any further help, 
provide further clarification, etc. Thanks again,
mike
