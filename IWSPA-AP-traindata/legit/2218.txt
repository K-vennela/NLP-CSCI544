*NSM South East Minnesota Leader Sam Johnson confronts Mayor and City
Council over illegal immigration.*
Clueless Mayor says he won't sign Johnson's petition to enforce immigration
laws because he doesn't want to support Nazi's. The people of Austin don't
want illegals in their Community, therefore who is this Mayor standing up
for other than his beloved illegals that have overrun the Community? The
citizens of Austin will never re-elect a Mayor who sides with the illegal
aliens. Don't expect to get re-elected Mayor Stiehm, we will make sure the
entire City knows where you stand politically in regards to the illegals,
and loss of American jobs to these invaders.

An Austin man's request that city council members sign a petition demanding
the sheriff enter into an agreement with federal authorities to enforce
immigration laws was rebuffed Monday.
Instead, the request by Samuel Johnson, an Austin man who's organized
anti-immigration rallies and says he's a member of the National Socialist
Movement, created a few heated moments at the meeting.
Johnson was there to announce a petition that he had created addressed to
Mower County Sheriff Terese Amazi concerning illegal immigration.
"We demand that the Mower County Sheriff's Department enter into a
memorandum agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to
enforce immigration laws," Johnson said, reading from the petition.
Previously, the sheriff has said this is a federal issue, but there is a
program that trains local officers to enforce immigration law, Johnson said.
"I was just wondering if anyone here would like to be the first to (sign the
petition)," Johnson asked the council.
Austin Mayor Tom Stiehm was the first to break the silence saying: "If
anyone wants to sign it, speak up. I certainly don't want to sign it."
When Johnson asked why he wasn't going to sign the petition about "illegal
aliens," Stiehm interrupted.
"This isn't a forum for that," Stiehm said. "If you want to say something,
make your statement and then sit down, but we aren't having a forum."
"This isn't a forum," Johnson replied. "This is a petition for the city of
Austin and the gang problem that is increasingly going on, and you can't
deny that anymore. I think this is a clear issue here in the city and it
needs to be taken care of now instead of hiding behind the city council and
other local agencies."
Johnson left the meeting immediately after his statement.
After the meeting, Stiehm explained the comments he'd made to Johnson.
"The reason I don't support him is because that guy is a Nazi," Stiehm said.
"We fought a war against the Nazis, and I am sure as heck not going to
support anything they do."
In response to the petition, Amazi said: "They can demand anything they
want."
Amazi said the sheriff's department has neither the manpower nor the budget
to send deputies to the two-month, out-of-state training session, which is
needed in order to work with ICE officials.
"I have looked into this issue," she said. "What the program does is it
gives our deputies the ability to work with ICE officials, it doesn't give
them independent status. If they want to give me the funding, then sure. But
even with that said, they still have to work with ICE officials. We cannot
enforce federal laws."* *
