Just got to Skadden. Bags are still with us. I told Simas we look like pharmaceutical reps, he laughed like he has been all day. Pritzker was good, he was a real data junkie. He told us about the trumps swindling the prrizkers in the 80s. I am relatively dry.
Lunch was good. Dave and JB had the salmon. I ate too fast and almost burped at the table. I landed a big laugh about the republican convention during lunch. JB reminds me of Korge.
We are about to start with Chuck smith.
