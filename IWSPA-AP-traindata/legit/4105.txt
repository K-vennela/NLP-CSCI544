Phil,
If it works, let's plan on me visiting for the day April 30 (I'll come out April 29; leave
May 1). I'll put the date on my calendar and assume it works unless I hear otherwise. If
there is a better day that week, please let me know.
Thanks,
Dave
Dave,
Will send on your details to the seminar organizer here. The week
of April 28 - May 2 is OK for me. I hope this is what you meant by
last week.
A few thoughts on the plots.
1. There isn't a drop off in land data around 1945 - nor during WW2.
So this is different from the ocean data. Most series are complete
or have been slightly infilled during the period in Europe. Berlin
for example only missed one day's T obs in April 45.
2. Fuego could be underestimated.
3. It could also be that sulphate emissions were very high at this time
- late 60s,  early 70s.
I'll await the text !
Cheers
Phil
