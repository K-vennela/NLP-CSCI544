Hi, I have some questions about NSM membership.  I was wondering what the
differances are between the levels of commitment
and what the different branches of service mean.  Also would some one in
Moorhead be with the Fargo chapter or one of the
Minnesota ones.  I know I would like to be an active member just not sure
what level or branch.
Thanks,  Steve
