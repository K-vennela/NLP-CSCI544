<x-rich>Dear Colleagues,
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you who have attended the
SRES Lead Authors' meeting (17-19 September 1997) and Rob Swart and 
his colleagues from RIVM for organizing and hosting the meeting.  
We have achieved a lot in the three short days as you will soon also see 
from the minutes.  The minutes of the meeting will be forwarded to you later this week
together with the revised SRES work plan that we have discussed during the meeting.
Sorry that it took a while longer this time for the completion of the minutes, 
but I hope that they will refresh you memory about the outcome of the meeting.
Erik Haites just e-mailed that he returned from the IPCC plenary meeting in
Maldives and that the new IPCC Bureau has been appointed.  It consists of
30 members: the Chair (Bob Watson), 5 Vice-Chairs (R. Pachuari (India), R.
Odingo (Kenya), G. Meira Filho (Brazil), Y. Izrael (Russia), K. Seiki
(Japan), and 8 Bureau members for each of the three Working Groups.  The
Bureau for Working Group III (responsible for SRES) is B. Metz
(Netherlands), O. Davidson (Sierra Leone), E. Jochem (Germany), M.
Munasinghe (Sri Lanka), E. Calvo (Peru), R. Madruga (Cuba), R.T.M.
Sutamihardja (Indonesia), and L. Lorentsen (Norway).
Best regards,  
Naki
