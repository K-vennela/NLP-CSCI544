Gareth,
It seems to me, from reading your email, that you do not realize that
this is precisely what MAGICC/SCENGEN already does -- i.e., it uses the
scaling method that Ben Santer and I 'invented' in the late 1980s to get
time dependent patterns of future climate change. I am attaching a
description of the method as we employ it.
The current CDROM version uses only a SAR version of the UD-EBM. Of
course, there is a TAR version that Sarah used for the TAR, developed by
me and Sarah -- but mainly Sarah. This has not yet been put into
MAGICC/SCENGEN, although I am in the process of doing so (along with
making a number of other changes to the software). We do not normally
give the code for TAR/MAGICC to others unless it is as part of a
collaborative project. As Mike Hulme noted, what we can do for/with you
will have to be a joint decision with me and Sarah.
The issue of how well scaling works compared with a full AOGCM is both
important and of considerable interest to me (and Ben Santer). It is
something we have looked at in the past, cursorily, and which we were
planning to investigate more fully with the suite of PCM runs that we
have here. There are some tricky issues that need to be addressed.
So, perhaps we should pool our intellectual, modelling and data
resources?
Anyhow, check out the attached and get back to me with your views. 
The 'new and improved version' of MAGICC/SCENGEN should be available in
beta-test form in about a month. It will have around 30 models in its
data base, and it does a lot of new things that I can tell you about
later.
Tom.
