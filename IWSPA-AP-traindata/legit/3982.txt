SS Probate Herring,
Contact this man via staff duty and see exactly what he is offering.  Is he
talking free transport to help the Party, or what is he charging? I think he
may be usefull in transporting troops from the link up location outside DC
to the actual march, but if its costing a fortune, we are already stretched
on food and meeting hall expense, so please check into exactly what he is
offering. 88 Commander Schoep
