Hello my name is Matt, I am 22 years old and I live in Berks County
Pennsylvania. I am very interested in joining the NSM and looking over the
application I have a few questions.
1. I am currently on probation for Conspiracy to commit arson which is a
felony charge. Would this have any affect on my joining?
2. On the application it ask for ethnicity/national orgin. What exactly is
being asked ie. what country you were born in?
3. At the part where it ask to indicate what branch what is the difference
between the branches. NSM, NSM stormtrooper and skinhead division?
Any response would be appericated. I can be reached either through the
private message on the Stormfront board or through my email
user@domain.com Thank you for your time.
Hail White Victory
matt
