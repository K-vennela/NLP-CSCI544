Malcolm,
Keith should be reading emails. Probably been a misunderstanding. I've only glanced at
the nonsense but didn't see anything related to Indigirka.  I see they are now getting at
the Taimyr site, so Keith/Tom having to look at that one too.
They have some extra data from Vlad which CA won't have, so whatever they say there
will get more emails about keeping hold of more data. All the issues seem to relate to
canopy closed sites like Fritz would have likely sampled and more open sites. They are
trying to contact the Russians to get site pictures or anything else.
Keith is on +44 1953 851013 if you fancy calling at the weekend.
They get at us for keeping hold of data, but they have no intention of publishing in the
peer-review literature!
Cheers
Phil
