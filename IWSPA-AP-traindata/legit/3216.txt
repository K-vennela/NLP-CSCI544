Dear Mike
Thank you for sending the outline bid submitted last October. After reviewing the document, my colleagues and I were of the view that TERI should go non-exclusive. Our primary interest is to be part of the project and given that we (TERI) would have the role of an affiliate in both the bids, it was decided that we go non-exclusive.
We understand that the outline bid is confidential and I can assure you that it will not be shared with anyone outside the concerned colleagues at TERI. Also, I assure you of all possible support TERI can provide in developing the final bid. We look forward to a fruitful association with you on the project. 
Wishing you all the best in securing the bid.
Kind regards
Sujata

Dear Sujata,
I attach a copy of our outline bid from last October - it is now evolving
rapidly of course in preparation for final submission.  This gives you a
quick idea about our Consortium and plans.  You will also see the names and
institutes of our partners. May I re-iterate that this document is
confidential and must not be disclosed to anyone outside your immediate
colleagues in TERI.
TERI was *not* listed as a formal co-applicant (non-UK institutions are not
eligible to be formal co-applicants), but was listed as an 'affiliated
organisation' along with about 10 others here in the UK.  We would propose
to do the same in the final bid, but say a little bit more about where and
how TERI would interact with us were we to win the Centre.
If you decide to remain exclusively with our bid, then I will send you the
first draft of our final submission during the next week - this will
indicate more details about our research programmes and where TERI may be
seen to interact with us as a key overseas collaborator.
However, if you decide to join with both bids - Imperial and UEA - then we
will simply continue to list you as a collaborator, but we could not then
agree to any further interaction over the next 2 weeks.
Best Regards,
Mike
