These are some good letters!

"In a state that claims the highest number of
individuals on antidepressants, the same drugs the FDA
has warned us causes suicidality in adolescents
(please see the actual black box warning on the FDA
Web site), and that also claims such a high suicide
rate, if we are to really study this issue and save
young people, we cannot ignore the role of psychiatric
drugs. I challenge those who are claiming that only 3
percent of the young people were on psych drugs to
back up their claim."

"While I'm in agreement with giving teens and parents
tools to prevent this, I am not in agreement with
medication and therapy being the answer. Medicine and
therapists treat 'symptoms,' not the problem.
"As a single parent of an autistic child and two
teenagers, I have my challenges. The number one most
important tool I use with my kids is communication. I
make time for them and make them feel important, which
is difficult with life being so hectic today.
"I also make sure certain basics are 'in': adequate
sleep, little to no TV, little to no sugar, a healthy
diet, vitamins, exercise and quality time. Lastly, I
make sure my kids have jobs around the house so they
have a purpose and realize that their contribution to
the family is important."
