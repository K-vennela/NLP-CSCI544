HI Keith,
here (w/ the supplementary info also attached) is the paper summarizing the results I
showed in Victoria of the RegEM analysis of pseudoproxies in the forced CSM simulation.
This is in review as a "letter" in Journal of Climate, and can be referred to as
"submitted" in the zero-order draft.
As we discussed, parallel experiments are being done using the MBH98 method, but regardless
of those results, this suggests, at least, that the RegEM-based NH reconstructions (e.g. in
the Rutherford et al paper you're co-author on) are unlikely to be impacted by the bias
discussed by von Storch et al...
