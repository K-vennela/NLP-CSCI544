NEW YORK TIMES // ASHLEY PARKER
Donald J. Trump, turning his attention to the general election, has begun q=
uietly reaching out to key elements of the Republican establishment as he s=
eeks to unite the party behind his candidacy before his anticipated battle =
against Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump, who is expected to run on a nonideologi=
cal platform of his own design, is trying to reassure party officials that =
he understands there are certain norms even he needs to follow as the Repub=
lican nominee, and that he is capable of producing an organization and infr=
astructure that can sustain a costly general election campaign. His team, a=
lready working to transform a lean operation into a national presidential c=
ampaign apparatus, has been reaching out to members of Congress and Washing=
ton think tanks; strategizing on how best to take on Mrs. Clinton and woo s=
upporters of her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and p=
lanning to head to Cleveland next week to help direct the party's July conv=
ention, according to aides.

NEW YORK TIMES // DAVID SANGER
Alarmed by Donald J. Trump's grip on the Republican presidential nomination=
, world leaders are wrestling with the possibility that, even if he loses t=
he general election, his ascent reflects a strain of American public opinio=
n that could profoundly reshape the way the United States addresses securit=
y alliances and trade. From Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul to the headquarters of=
NATO in Brussels and the vulnerable Baltic nations along Russia's western =
border, officials and analysts said in interviews that they saw the success=
of Mr. Trump's "America first" platform as a harbinger of pressure for all=
ies to pay up or make trade concessions in return for military protection. =
In many capitals, Mr. Trump's formal and off-the-cuff foreign policy propos=
als - his threat to pull out of NATO; his musings about removing the United=
States' nuclear umbrella over Japan and South Korea; his pledge to slap hu=
ge trade tariffs on China - are regarded with a mix of alarm and confusion.=
Asked on Thursday if Beijing was concerned about the prospect of a Trump p=
residency, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, replied, "We h=
ope the U.S. people from all walks of life would view bilateral relations f=
rom a reasonable and objective perspective."

WASHINGTON POST // JENNA JOHNSON
For his first rally since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Dona=
ld Trump ventured on Thursday to West Virginia, a state that believed in hi=
m when few did. When Trump flirted with running for president during the la=
st cycle, an April 2011 poll in West Virginia found him tied for first plac=
e with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who had won the state's nomi=
nating convention three years earlier. When Trump announced his 2016 candid=
acy last June and dominated =ADsocial-media conversations, his highest rate=
of engagement was in West Virginia. When the race still had three Republic=
an candidates, polls showed that Trump was poised to win at least 60 percen=
t of the vote in the state's primary, which will be held Tuesday. West Virg=
inia's statewide demographics mirror those of the down-on-their-luck towns =
and cities where Trump has hosted many of his campaign rallies. The state h=
as a median annual household income of $41,576 - nearly $12,000 less than t=

Restoring Bathroom Sanity in North Carolina<<<link>>
06/opinion/restoring-bathroom-sanity-in-north-carolina.html?ref=3Dopinion>
NEW YORK TIMES // EDITORIAL BOARD
The Department of Justice has given Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina unti=
l Monday to abandon the state's discriminatory law barring transgender peop=
le from using public restrooms based on their gender identity. The law also=
blocked Charlotte's antidiscrimination ordinance, and prohibited cities an=
d counties from enacting similar laws. In a letter issued Thursday, the Jus=
tice Department's top civil rights prosecutor, Vanita Gupta, warned the gov=
ernor that the statute, which was passed in March, violates federal civil r=
ights law. She said that the Department of Justice may sue North Carolina a=
nd that the Department of Education may withhold federal funding for its sc=
hools. The state law peddles the malicious idea that transgender people are=
sexual predators and that allowing people to use a bathroom that reflects =
their gender identity violates the rights of others. It immediately drew a =
strong backlash from civil rights groups, religious leaders and businesses.=
Major corporations have decried the law, calling it an impediment to recru=
iting and retaining top talent. Employers have already suspended plans to e=
xpand operations in North Carolina, costing the state hundreds of jobs.
