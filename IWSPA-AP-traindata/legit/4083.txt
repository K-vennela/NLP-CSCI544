88! Bill.  I have an important position that I wanted to bounce off you to see if you might be interested in. We are looking for a public liaison director to work with the public on a regular basis, fielding phone messages to HQ from prospective members and others.   We need someone with good communication skills who can provide a good image for the Party in dealing with the public.  Because of the sensitivity and importance of this position, we need the right man.  It is a lot of work, but is a very important position for the Party.  You came to mind immediately, and I wanted to see what your initial thoughts were.  A cell phone or other phone with free long distance would be a must.  Get back to me asap, and ask any questions. If you are interested we can talk more by phone. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Hail Victory!  M Sgt Kris Johnson
