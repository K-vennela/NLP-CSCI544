We’ve done very few (two total, I believe) pure e-commerce deals which Georgina and Sabatini worked on (neither of which involved Crackle), so I need to give it a think.  If by e-commerce related issues, she means more general issues (e.g., privacy policies apply generally to all our sites), then it may broaden the scope of lawyers in and outside my department that would be good for her to speak with.  Crackle is AVOD, so no transactional elements to it.
