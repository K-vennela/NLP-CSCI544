Outrage and relief at Nathan Deal=E2=80=99s veto of =E2=80=98campus carry=
=E2=80=99 bill
Georgia's Republican governor rejected the two top priorities of a legisla=
ture controlled by his own party this year=2C defying election year politi=
cs in a deep red state. Gov. Nathan Deal=2C in his second and constitution=
ally limited final term=2C vetoed legislation that would have protected op=
ponents of gay marriage just days after the close of the legislative sessi=
on in March. But he waited until Tuesday=2C the last possible day to issue=
vetoes=2C to block another bill that would have allowed people over 21 an=
d with state permits to carry concealed handguns on college campuses. Both=
proposals were popular with the majority of Georgia's Republican lawmaker=
s. But opponents aggressively lobbied Deal to block the measures. The Demo=
cratic Party of Georgia issued a carefully-worded statement devoid of much=
specific mention of Deal. =E2=80=9CGeorgia Democrats hope that next year=
=E2=80=99s session will yield more productive legislation aimed at young p=
eople than the election year stunts we were given by
the Georgia GOP in 2016=2C=E2=80=9D said executive director Rebecca DeHart=

Bernie Sanders Wins Indiana=E2=80=99s Democratic Primary
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won Indiana=E2=80=99s Democratic primary Tuesd=
ay=2C giving his long-shot campaign some good news but probably not enough=
delegates to change the trajectory of the race. In Indiana voting=2C 83 d=
elegates were at stake. The Sanders win comes after losses in five of the=
last six contests and gives him some rationale to keep his campaign going=
in the face of what still looks to be an insurmountable delegate lead. Po=
lls showed a close race=2C and the Clinton campaign had been braced for a=
loss in Indiana. The state allows independents to participate=2C and thes=
e voters have favored Mr. Sanders. The Vermont senator spent $1.5 million=
in ads as of Monday=2C according to a Democratic media buyer; Mrs. Clinto=
n spent nothing. Coming into the balloting=2C Mrs. Clinton had 1=2C645 ple=
dged delegates=2C the type chosen by voters=2C and Mr. Sanders had 1=2C318=
=2C meaning her lead was 327. When superdelegates=2C who can vote for anyb=
ody=2C are included=2C she had 2=2C165 delegates to his 1=2C357=2C
according to the AP=E2=80=99s tallies.
