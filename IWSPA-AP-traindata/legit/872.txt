Dear Tim,
Thanks for your rapid replies and your help. This is all very useful.
Well, lets see what this gives...
There are some notable differences just between our relative comparisons of the different
series which  must have something to do with the relative scaling and aligning of the
series. The position of Crowley and Lowery, in particular, is quite inconsistent between
our respective comparisons.  When we scale the various series to the full N. Hem
instrumental annual mean  CRU record 1856-1980, we get a a very different relative ordering
of the different series, as shown in the attached figure from my Science perspective piece
from last year
This should not, however,  influence the EOF decomposition if all series are zero-mean and
standardized prior to the EOF analysis, but the scaling and alignment of the result, in the
end, will be sensitive to all of these various issues.
So, in short, lets see what we get, and then discuss any similarities/differences w/ your
result, then make a decision as to what to show in the Eos piece. I'm sure we can come up
w/ something we're all happy with...
Please do send us your & Keith's preferred version of the MXD reconstruction--we'll collect
the others from the individual sources (most we already have, I think)...,
