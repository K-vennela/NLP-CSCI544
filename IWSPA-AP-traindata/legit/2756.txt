Chick,
look at the instrumental record!  there are huge differences between
different regions - Alaska has warmed substantially while eastern North
America cooled after the 1950s.  locking onto local records, no matter how
beautiful, can lead to serious errors.  If the ice cores are so infallible
why do they give substantially different stories for grip and gisp2 over
the last 1500 years?
the bottom line is that one cannot make a robust case that decadally
hemispheric temperatures over the last 1500 years were  even as warm as the
late 20th century, much less warmer.
