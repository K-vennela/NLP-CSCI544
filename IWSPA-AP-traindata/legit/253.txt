My name is Eli Saslow, and I'm a writer for The Washington Post. My
assignment for the paper is to write about this presidential campaign, and
I'd love to spend some time with you guys and write a story about your
thoughts on all of this. Mainly, I'm curious: Now that it seems Obama will
win the Democratic nomination, what do you plan to do to make sure he
doesn't end up taking office? Has it spurred the group to action?
My hope would be to travel there and spend time with the group for a
feature story. I would just be like a fly on the wall, listening and then
writing about it to get your voices and views into the paper.
Let me know what you think. Please feel free to e-mail or call me if you
want to hear more about the idea. My number is 202 334 5113.
Thanks so much.
I hope all's well,
Eli
