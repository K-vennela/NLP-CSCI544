Celebrating Sunshine
Regarding "Celebrate Government In The Sunshine"
(Commentary, March 12):
How refreshing to read about something so valuable -
sunshine laws. And let's be proud that Florida was
smart enough early on to make them a reality.
Sunshine is a good name. Dishonest people don't want
the light of day to shine on their deceptions. Only
those with something to hide would want to stop
disclosure of e-mails, call logs and other records
covered by such laws.
Thank you to the paper for promoting national Sunshine
Week.

Keep Shining The Light
Regarding "Audit: Agencies Often Fail Sunshine Laws"
(Nation/World, March 12):
Thanks for this excellent information on the sunshine
laws. I appreciate having a better perspective on what
happens to sunshine law requests that go unanswered.
My first thought to an unanswered request is, "What do
they have to hide?" I see now that there is clearly a
need to educate those in public offices who are most
likely to receive such a request. We do need to put
more teeth in the law to dissuade those who would tend
to trash the request because they would rather no one
knew what was really going on.
May the sun continue to shine on what our public
officials are doing.

Only Way To Monitor
Thank you for writing about the importance of sunshine
laws. It is absolutely the public's only way to
monitor what really goes on within our government. If
we truly are a government of, by, and for the people,
then the sunshine laws are one of the most effective
tools for ensuring this condition.
