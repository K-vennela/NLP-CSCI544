Hi, Leah,
Great seeing you last week in New York; I’m sad I couldn’t/wasn’t able to spend more time with the group this year.  Looking forward to next year, I figure I should probably pull together the group of in-house counsel who are involved in/impacted by e-commerce issues and agree as a team on what activities/documents/research add best value to our working lives.  Could I trouble you for the folks in your department who support those SPE businesses that present e-commerce-related legal issues (Crackle, and …?)
Thanks so much and best always,
Jennifer
