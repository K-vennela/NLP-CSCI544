I am just having to go so I will think about the "should we?" . The answer to the "can we?"
is yes. I have spoken to the person organising the editorial review and she has promised me
she will get it to us in the next week or so. If we can get it back immediattely she says
we can make the December issue. Therefore it is possible to do the edits if it means very
little change to the text. I have also confirmed that we will pay 1500 dollars for the
colour and they say they are working on these now. I really want to get this into the 2000
so I can include it in the RAE. Ed is here now and has some great looking extended PDSI
reconstructions (1000 years) for the western US.
I am suspicious as to whether the negative trend in Mike's Hockey stick prior to the 20th
century is not at least partly the result of a trend in the long  high elevation western US
trees he uses . Malcolm sent me some figures for the HIHOL meeting and in this work he cuts
off the juvenile growth sections of the long tree data but does no detrending on the
remainder. This might leave a linear age trend in these data. I remember that Mike in his
long reconstruction , stated that the pc representing the western US stuff was essential
for getting a verifiable result. Interesting , but only a diversion. We can discuss the JGR
and other stuff in Avignon. Hope your weekend was a god one. I tend to agree a
bout the NAO meeting- you could use the money (and perhaps time) to better effect.
