Dear all,
Just to add a bit to Ben's notes. The conceptual problem is how to 
account for two different types of uncertainty in comparing a single
observed trend (with temporal uncertainty) with the average of a
bunch of model trends (where the uncertainty is from inter-model 
differences). The "old" d3 tried to do this, but failed the synthetic 
data test. The new d3 does this a different way (in the way that the
inter-model uncertainty term is quantified). This passes the synthetic
data test very well.
The new d3 test differs from DCSP07 only in that it includes in the
denominator of the test statistic an observed noise term. This is by
far the bigger of the two denominator terms. Ignoring it is very
wrong, and this is why the DCSP07 method fails the synthetic data
test.
Tom.
