Hey Tom, thanks for checking w/ me on this. Re, Moberg: Yes, in fact we (me, Phil, Tim,
Keith, Caspar, etc.) submitted a comment to Nature about the problem w/ the variance
scaling used by Moberg. It can easily be shown to inflate the low- frequency variance in
synthetic experiments. I've attached both the original comment (which they judged to be too
technical to merit publication) and also a J. Climate paper where we discussed the same
result (see Figure 5 and associated discussion). Re, Von Storch et al. Yes, the paper you
have in mind is Osborn et al Climate Dynamics '06. I only seem to have the preprint though
(attached), please let me know if I can be of any further help w/ an of this, mike p.s. you
can delete the U.Va email address--haven't been there for 4 years! On Sep 22, 2009, at
