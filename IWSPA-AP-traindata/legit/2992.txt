Dear all,
It is a very good story; Mavis and Johnny having a baby and the family fighting for the baby to be like them is a very good idea which translate to every culture. The first 3rd of the movie is fantastic, as we discover the concept, and there is a lot of humor for all ages. 
The  rest of the movie has more visual humor for kids, but works perfectly well. The cake scene is maybe a little bit too long, but the ending is sweet.
I’m glad there are baby Wolfpups that can be very much appreciated in our market.
We can expect a success at least as big as the first one, but we’ll have more competition than we had on the first one and unfortunatly, the ticket price in France is lower now due to the 4€ ticket price for the audience under 14.
GBO estimate 11.5M€
Best regards
Eric
