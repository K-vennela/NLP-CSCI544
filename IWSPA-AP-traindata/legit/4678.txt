Comrades,
Last January in 2007, we held the first ever mass burning of jewish, and
degenerate books in the United States in St. Paul Minnesota. We are
currently planning another event of this magnitude, to throw more jewish
literary filth into the pyre's. The location for this event will be
announced shortly, and the date will be early March 2008.
Here is a music video from the event ,<<link>>
