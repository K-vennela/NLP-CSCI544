***PUBLIC NOTICE***
To Whom All It May Concern,
14! 88!
The NSM Ohio has scheduled another book burning event to show the public
that we stand up against the avalanche of pro-homosexual and lesbian
books, literature that degrades the white race, books that promote
anti-Christian morals, values and ethics, books that continue to
promote Holocaust lies,  books that promote non-existant black
achievements as well as the  jewish Talmud which endorses the killing, rape,
sodomization, theft, attacks on and deceit of all non-jews.
For too long our nation has put up with this degenerate and perverted
filth that is forced into our faces and  into our childrens schools! *It's
time to become part of history and show the world and nation that we are the
ones who have had enough!*
This book burning is one way of *peacefully* gathering together, united,
to have comraderie and friendship with people who feel the same way as
yourself and to display in a public event how we desperately need to
express our attempt to keep our nation from becoming a degraded cesspool of
pornography and garbage hidden behind the titles of "art" or "literature".
The Ohio National Socialist Movement is going to change that.
*WE*are taking a stand against the politically correct, manipulated
schools
system and publication industry that chooses to pollute our children and *
our* lives with this misguided and deceptive agenda.
The Meeting will take place March 1st at 4 p.m. in Lewisburg, OH. We will
carpool to a public awareness meeting. From there we will proceed to a
private location for the book burning. Afterwards we will go to a meeting
hall for refreshments and hot chow.
For those interested, please contact Mark Martin at 937-558-1478 or by
email user@domain.com   OR Lewisburg Unit Leader Gary Robinson @
937-533-5008 .
We look forward to meetiong all those of like  mind in this stand against
literary tyranny!
RR!
M. Martin
