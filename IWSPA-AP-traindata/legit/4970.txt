Good afternoon!
I know that's probably the most mind-numbing subject line I could have picked, but hopefully you'll still read this. Three things:
1.       The NFC sheet now includes the amount each person needs to give or raise to qualify for the next package.
2.       It pulls from NGP nightly, which means contact information is overwritten from there. Please check your donors' emails before mail-merging. We will have interns working on checking all of the contact information from the original sheet in the coming weeks, but you can make any changes you'd like in NGP and they will be reflected in the NFC sheet the next morning.
3.       I've attached the FEC reports for the DCCC, DSCC, and HVF this cycle (>5k) by popular demand.
Thanks,
Dan
