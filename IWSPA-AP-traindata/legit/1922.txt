Hi Phil
Thanks for the comments on the Briefing report. You say "There is no evidence with London
of any change in the amount of the UHI over the last 40 years. The UHI is clear, but it's
not getting any worse" and sent a paper to show this.  By coincidence I also got recently a
paper from Rob which says "London's UHI has indeed become more intense since the 1960s esp
during spring and summer". Its not something I need to sort out for UKCIP08, but I thought
you both might like to be aware of each others findings. I didn't keep a copy of Rob's PDF
after I printed it off but I am sure you can swap papers. I don't need to be copied in to
any discussion.
Cheers
Geoff
