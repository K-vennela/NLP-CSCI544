Ok to switch to the FR page, assuming we leave the graphic language as-is.
On the photo, best option is to include the full attribution on the graphic=
with links spelled out if we can't hyperlink. Riskier but second best opti=
on is to leave the original one you had and put the full attribution on the=
landing page. Looks big enough to me to just throw the full attribution on=
there, its ok if the font is really small.
