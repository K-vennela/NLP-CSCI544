Dear Steven,
Please note that the head of Fundamental, Mr. Mark Guo, personally assured us that they will transfer our share of Hotel T before the end of November this year. The delay is due to the time that might take for local companies to process remittance requests to a foreign company.
As to Hotel T 2, the deal that we can get from Fundamental is as follows:
1- same terms as Hotel T: minimum 18% and follows a scale system
2- $1million US dollars up front, non refundable and not subject to film's performance
3- day-and-date release and/or at least within 4 weeks of the US release date
4- we can set the date for payment so that we won't have the same problem
I believe this is a very good deal so let us know if this other company can top this.
Best regards,
Li
