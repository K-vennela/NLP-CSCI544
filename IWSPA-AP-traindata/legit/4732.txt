Hey all-
Thank you for the recovery gift package. It was much, much appreciated.
I am recovered and back at work.
Special shout out to Michael Pratt for visiting me in the hospital. He is a
good guy.
At the hospital they tried to get me to drink with a straw,  but I
remembered what Max Marshall said about men who drink with straws so I
refused.
Hope you are all well. Miss you!
Justin
