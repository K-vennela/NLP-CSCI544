FEATURED PRODUCT     Wiser: Getting Beyond Groupthink to Make Groups Smarter HBR Press Book We’ve all been involved in group decisions—and they’re hard. And they often turn out badly. Why? Many blame bad decisions on “groupthink” without a clear idea of what that term really means. Now, “Nudge” coauthor Cass Sunstein and leading decision-making scholar Reid Hastie shed light on the specifics of why and how group decisions go wrong—and offer tactics and lessons to help leaders avoid the pitfalls and reach better outcomes. They explain in clear and fascinating detail the distinct problems groups run into and provide methods and advice for making groups smarter. These approaches include silencing the leader so that the views of other group members can surface, rethinking rewards and incentives to encourage people to reveal their own knowledge, thoughtfully assigning roles that are aligned with people's unique strengths, and more. With examples from a range of organizations—from Google to the CIA—and written in an engaging and witty style, “Wiser” will not only enlighten you; it will help your team and your organization make better decisions—decisions that lead to greater success.
