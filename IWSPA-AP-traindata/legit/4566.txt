DRIVING THE WEEK: Obama departs at 12:55 p.m. for a week in Vietnam and Japan (16,000 miles, per AP) - "Obama's Asian nuclear nightmare: Fueled by Trump's rhetoric and North Korea's threats, Japan and South Korea are eyeing nuclear weapons of their own," by Michael Crowley: "Obama's visit next Friday to Hiroshima, which was incinerated by a U.S. atomic bomb in August 1945, will promote a message diametrically opposite from Trump's. 'It's an opportunity to focus the world's attention on the need to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and seek a world without them,' said deputy national adviser Ben Rhodes. ...

Recent satellite imagery suggests that North Korea may be building a new tunnel in preparation for its fifth nuclear test. Officials in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are losing patience with international efforts to thwart Pyongyang's program. ... And those governments increasingly fret that the U.S. ... may become a less reliable ally." <<link>>

"[I]t makes for riveting filmmaking -- as a portrait of a campaign in crisis, of a fascinatingly flawed politician, and especially of a marriage.

'for language and some sexual material.' Running time: 100 minutes." Review <<link>> ... Trailer  <<link>>
