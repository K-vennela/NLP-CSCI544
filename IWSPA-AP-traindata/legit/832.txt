William Oorbeek dropped Garrett as a client late last year, sources told POLITICO's Zachary Warmbrodt and Anna Palmer. Garrett is fighting the race of his career against a well-funded Democrat. Garrett has since hired Hammond & Associates, which also works with Freedom Caucus members Jim Jordan and Scott DesJarlais. Read more in the latest Financial Services Influence.
THEY'RE FEELING LUCKY: Google confirmed to POLITICO yesterday it will be taking an official role in this summer's Republican convention, reports Pro Technology's Tony Romm. The tech giant - facing harsh criticism from advocates denouncing GOP front-runner Donald Trump's controversial comments on minorities, immigrants and women - will run the official livestream at the Cleveland event, providing attendees and viewers with election trends, videos, virtual reality tools and other data. Google offered similar services at both parties' conventions in 2012, as well as at presidential debates earlier this year. <<link>>

BUILDERS: Construction Dive's Kim Slowey reports construction lobbying is on the rise, citing Center for Responsive Politics data that shows the industry spent more than $53 million lobbying in 2015. Jim Tobin, National Association of Home Builders executive vice president and chief lobbyist, said his group has been "extraordinarily busy" because of the Obama administration's "anti-business" policies. <<link>>
ROI: A new analysis from Maplight shows that for every one dollar U.S. government contractors have invested in political influence in the past decade, the industry has received $1,171 in taxpayer money. Maplight's Frank Bass writes that the 25 largest federal contractors have received almost $1.6 trillion during fiscal 2014 for their work since October 2005. Additionally, the Pentagon spends more on contracting than all other federal agencies combined. Lockeed Martin Corp., the country's largest contractor and maker of the F-35 Lightning II jet, received $331 billion in federal money since October 2005, and spent $140 million on lobbying and political contributions between then and
September 2015. This puts the firm's return at $2,366 for every $1 dollar used for lobbying or political spending. <<link>>
