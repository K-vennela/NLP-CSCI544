BREAKING: BERNIE SANDERS has accepted a Fox News invitation to debate one more time before California's June 7 primary, POLITICO's Hadas Gold reports. Over to you HILLARY CLINTON. More here: <<link>> 
IS THIS BERNING AN ETERNAL FLAME: A call for cooler heads in the Democratic party has led, instead, to an escalating flame war. And BERNIE SANDERS' campaign and the Democratic National Committee appear no closer to toning things down. 
Sanders' campaign today blamed DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's failed leadership for a rift, POLITICO's Nolan D. McCaskill reports. The latest fight comes after chaos at Saturday's state convention in Nevada, where Sanders loyalists believe delegate allocations were done unfairly.
After Wasserman Schultz called for Sanders to denounce the demonstrations, his campaign responded by accusing her of "throwing shade." And Sanders camp fired back at Wasserman Schultz on Wednesday morning after the Democratic National Committee chairwoman panned the campaign's "anything but acceptable" response to reports of violence and threats from Sanders supporters at the Nevada Democratic convention over the weekend. 
Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, pointedly accused Wasserman Schultz of undermining the Sanders campaign from the get-go and called into question her leadership. "He categorically condemns any kind of threats that went on - absolutely unacceptable," Weaver told CNN today before accusing Wasserman Schultz of "throwing shade on the Sanders campaign since the very beginning." <<link>> 
Happy Wednesday. Whoa, we're half way there. Whoa-oh, 2016 Blast-ing on a prayer ... <<link>> Henry C.

2) SUPREME LIST: DONALD TRUMP released a list of 11 judges he'd consider for Supreme Court appointments, POLITICO's Nick Gass reports. It's a virtually unprecedented move that's meant to telegraph his conservative credentials. <<link>> The prospective candidates are a mix of Bush appointees to federal courts and state Supreme Court justices - a, dare we say, somewhat conventional list for a Republican candidate. It was sufficiently conventional that the White House's immediate attack - that Democrats were unlikely to vote for any of the judges suggested - felt like a debate from a quieter, almost pre-Trump era.

BLAST NOTE: When was the last time any candidate gave you names of Supreme Court candidates?
3) MEASURING UP: It's hard to figure out how much DONALD TRUMP is actually worth. POLITICO's Shane Goldmacher reports Trump's second financial disclosure document is so long and his holdings so vast and byzantine that it's impossible to measure in specifics. That, combined with the Federal Election Commission's vague disclosure requirements, means that it's impossible to verify what Trump says he's worth: about $557 million a year in income and $10 billion in net worth. But the documentation does shed some light on his holdings and debts, which include loans for renovation project on an old post office in Washington, D.C., and blue-chip companies like Google.

3) SLOUCHING TO PHILADELPHIA: HILLARY CLINTON won last night! But, yeah. A razor-thin win in Kentucky and a lopsided loss in Oregon to BERNIE SANDERS hardly showcased the confident strut of a Democratic nominee in waiting. It as a margin so thin, in fact, DONALD TRUMP could troll it. <<link>> POLITICO's Gabriel Debenedetti reports that her win, while keeping her from get blanked in the month of May, offered little else than that - a win. There's still no sign that the party is unifying (if anything the opposite). And now, Clinton will basically go dark for a bit before more primaries in June: she has few public events and several fundraisers planned. 
<<link>> The other macro problem for Clinton's campaign is how to deal with Trump. As POLITICO's Annie Karni reports, her campaign has tried out an array of attacks. But it's harder than it looks. <<link>> 
5) LIKE FRANKIE SAID I DID IT MY WAY: What did we say about DONALD TRUMP doing things a new way? POLITICO's Eli Stokols and Hadas Gold look at how Trump is redefining the Republican National Convention. And they find the candidate is unusually involved, micromanaging everything from speaking slots to what prime time moments will look like. And he is weighing up some high drama: Perhaps waiting until the RNC in Cleveland to reveal his running mate or even rolling out his cabinet during the festivities. <<link>>  
TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, HILLARY CLINTON out-earns DONALD TRUMP, but she's having a rough day on the Internet. Trump isn't seeing gentrification in Oakland. A Jersey man wins a fight and a woman uses her obituary for a sick burn. 
TRUMPED BY HER: HILLARY CLINTON's speaking fees were generally about twice as much as DONALD TRUMP's. (Yahoo!) <<link>> 
VIRAL PROBLEM: A video that highlights HILLARY CLINTON's shifting views is going viral. (The Washington Post). <<link>> 
OVER THE LINE: Some of the voicemails left by BERNIE SANDERS supporters for the Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman are pretty aggressive. (Mediaite) <<link>> 
LIKE BAGHDAD, ONLY MORE SO: DONALD TRUMP said Ferguson, Mo., and Oakland, Calif., were among the most dangerous places in the world. (The Washington Post) <<link>> 
KELLY FILED: Esquire thinks DONALD TRUMP got the best of Megyn Kelly in their interview special last night. <<link>> More on that here: <<link>> 
KISS AND TELL: DONALD TRUMP meets with former Secretary of State and GOP eminence grise Henry Kissinger today. (CBS) <<link>> 
GARDEN STATEMENT: A New Jersey man won a fight to fly a DONALD TRUMP flag. (NJ.com) <<link>> 
'ETERNAL' FLAME: A woman used her obituary to say she chose God's eternal embrace over choosing between HILLARY CLINTON and DONALD TRUMP. (Time) <<link>> 
WHAT'S NEXT: BERNIE SANDERS is in northern California today. But we're in a primary lull: No more voting until June. 
THEY SAID IT: "He's not a groper." -Ivanka Trump, on her dad, DONALD TRUMP. <<link>> 
MAGIC NUMBER: 49.3 million. That's how much DONALD TRUMP sold the Miss Universe Pageant for last year. <<link>>
