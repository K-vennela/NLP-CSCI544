Dear Mike,
Thanks for your detailed reply concerning Scengen and CC:Train.  I was not 
proposing to incorporate Scengen in a major way into the training package, 
and I am quite aware of the problems of consistency regarding aerosol 
effects, natural variability, etc.  Rather, I thought that the training 
package would be an excellent way to introduce the existence of Scengen 
(and MAGICC) to the Country Teams which are responsible for coordinating 
national assessments.  (the intention was NOT to provide intensive 
technical training in its use -- the country team members are largely 
coordinators, not technical climate experts). In this way, when it comes 
time to actually carry out the national assessments, Scengen would be 
recognised as a major tool for scenario generation and, if appropriate, CRU 
could be contacted regarding its application, technical training or 
collaboration.   You had mentioned to me at the IPCC meeting in London that 
one of your major aims was to get Scengen recognised as the "standard" for 
scenario generation for impact assessments, and I simply thought I saw a 
way of furthering that aim through the CC:Train mechanism.
Given the training programmes that you are currently proposing through 
ENRICH and others, I can understand your fears that we might "muddy the 
waters".  Let me pose the following options; that we
(1) use some hard-copy examples from Scengen;
(2) incorporate a demonstration diskette (do you have one?);
(3) just mention the existence of Scengen;
(4) not mention Scengen at all.
Frankly, I am quite happy with any of these.   The part on climate change 
scenarios is really only a small bit of the overall V&A training package in 
any case.
Good luck with your proposals.
Cheers,
Dick
