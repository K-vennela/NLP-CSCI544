Hi all
About time.  Incidentally i gave a copy to Mike McPhaden and discussed it with him last
week when we were together at the OceanObs'09 conference.  Mike is President of AGU.
Basically this is an acceptance with a couple of suggestions for extras, and some
suggestions for toning down the rhetoric.  I had already tried that a bit.  My reaction is
that the main thing is to expedite this.  That means no extras unless it really makes
sense.  And removal of a few unnecessary words like "absolutely".
In the abstract, we have a number of such adjectives that could be removed:  I agree with
Rev 3 in this.
"greatly overstates"  could be just "overstates" as it is reinforced better later.
"severely overestimates"  could be just "overestimates"
"faulty analysis"  maybe "flawed analysis"?
"extremely high" maybe "very high" or "unduly high"
I would leave last sentence alone though as the main comment.
A few more comments embedded below.
