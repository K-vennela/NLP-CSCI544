Hello all:
Good news this day.  The Wahl-Ammann paper also has been given fully accepted status today by Stephen Schneider.  I copy his affirmation of this below, and after that his remark from earlier this month regarding this status being equivalent to "in press".  I hope this meets the deadline of before March 1 for citation.
Peace, Gene
