Comrade,
Your application has arrived and we hope to have it processed by tonight, o=
r
within the next 2 days, and send you your membership materials.
After you read through the handbooks we send you, contact me again about
setting up a contact point for NSM Spain. We look forward to setting up a
contact point in your Nation, to spread word of the NSM and further branch
out over Europe. Our Division in England seems to be growing quite well,
with a good number of troops already. The Russian Division is also a strong
group. We look forward to getting NSM Spain off the ground. 88 Commander
Schoep
