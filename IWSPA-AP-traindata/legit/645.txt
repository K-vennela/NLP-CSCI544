Daer Armin,
I would like to confirm that RIVM is strongly committed to make a
substantial contribution to the AMS proposal, as was clear from our active
involvement in the discussions so far (except the Paris meeting where we
unfortunately could not send a representative). We have been in touch with
several other partners in developing ideas for the workpackage, but in view
of the high pressure under which the proposal is being put together,
communication is not always easy. I therefore include a list of elements we
would like to contribute to the respective parts of the proposal:.
WP1.      Scenarios: involved with proposal Brian O'Neill (contact: Detlef
van Vuuren). Important issues: delineation with scenarios in other
workpackages - no response so far.
WP   3.1. Possible contribution, depends on connection with WP1
3.3. Primarily through cooperation with Un.Utrecht - proposal sent to
Wokaun but no response. Possible to add global context with IMAGE/TIMER and
add non-energy emssion reductions not covered in original proposal by
Wokaun
3. 4. and 3.5: as for  3.3
WP   4.1. Suggested role for multi-gas stabilization profiles, burden
sharing regimes and EU action with IMAGE-FAIR combination (building on work
we have done with other partners for the European Commission). Current
proposal by Haxeltine, Leemans and Adger has 100% focus on impacts and
adaptation and should be broadened. We are ready to contribute
4.2. Now contains the regimes that should go under 4.1
4.6. Involved actively: see proposal Olsson&Metz that went to John
Schellnhuber
WP   5.4. Strong interest, but no response from coordinator (C. Jaeger) and
WP coordinator Hasselmann refers back to CJ (!). We will put together
proposal with Tyndall towards development of CIAS model.
Best regards,
Bert Metz
