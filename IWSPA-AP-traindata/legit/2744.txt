Mr. Herring=2CI received an email back from the Commander confirming your i=
dentity.  If you or someone from NSM would still like to speak with me then=
please=2C feel free to give me a call.  If you receive my voicemail please=
leave me a message and a number I can reach you.  I typically do not answe=
r my phone when I do not recognize the number calling.  I also live in the =
mountains so I do not get signal on my cell when I am at home. I sent a cou=
ple of emails to the Colorado POC but have not heard anything back from the=
m.  I hope I haven't ruffled any feathers by my emails.  I am just tired of=
the organizations that represent the white race not having the foresight t=
o actually take some action to work toward our goals or some of these idiot=
s who cannot speak intelligently or persuasively and try to take stupid act=
ions that actually hurt our "cause" instead of helping it.  A lot of these =
organizations are political dinosaurs and they need to either evolve or sta=
y out of the way of those who actually want to accomplish goals for our rac=
e. Anyway=2C I always speak my mind until I see I shouldn't speak my mind. =
I hope I haven't angered some in the NSM but if I have=2C tell them to giv=
e me some of their time and I'll convince them I am right.  I convinced a b=
lack the other day that society is better when it is segmented into section=
s of ethnicity so I figure I should be able to convince my own race of the =
same.  Of course=2C my plans and ideas are little bit more drastic but not =
much. I hope to hear from you or the Commander soon. 88Jeff Heuermann
