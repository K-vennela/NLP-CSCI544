Keith - is there a time in the next few days when you could stand 
talking briefly about this on the phone?  I think the fog about the 
status of the Indigirka/Yakutua data could be cleared really quickly 
that way. Once again, I'm really sorry it has been necessary to bother 
you with this. Cheers, Malcolm
