Dear Eystein and Peck,
Many thanks for your relpy and contribution for the glacier box. Everything 
is fine with me except for the sentence:
"Comparing the ongoing retreat of glaciers with the reconstructed records, 
it is evident that the current global pattern is unprecedented within the 
Holocene, as there is no known period with a global homogenous trend of 
retreating glaciers over centennial and shorter timescales."
The reason of my disagreement is the following: the resolution and the 
spatial and temporal coverage of the Holocene glacial records is not enough 
to compare it seriousely at the century level. For most of regions we even 
cannot estimate  the synchroniety of the records. Looking at the figure a 
reader will see that there was actually a period with "a global homogenous 
trend of retreating glaciers" during at least a millennium (at least 
7000-8000 bp) - not a century like now! To resolve this problem we can 
discuss in a braoder audience and ask the opinion of more experts if you 
wish - I can think of Luckman, Nesje, Grove, Porter, Karlen.
I corrected a little the second paragraph - removed three references - they 
are not used in our picture and, in fact not that good in terms of real 
reconstructions. I think we should stress clearly that the records from 
Scandinavia is now the most reliable and detailed.
Regards,
olga
