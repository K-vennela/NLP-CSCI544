Dear Keith/Sandy,
please don't pass on or discuss further -- this is the email I got from
Phil Newton. So with some reluncance I get to put up a strawman. I will
go with what we discussed in London but some nice graphics (or any
thoughts) would be helpful -- do you have any you can send me.
Simon

Dear Simon, Andy,
Many thanks for agreeing to each give an informal presentation to the Steering Committee
on the first afternoon of the meeting.
As I mentioned on the phone, what I'm after is for each of you to look at the Abrupt
proposal and Prescient proposal/draft-science plan (attached as WORD documents), stand
well back, and put forward some ideas for how one might combine them into a single
coherent programme.  The intention is to lay the foundation for some discussion, both
Monday afternoon and evening, in advance of the formal Steering Committee meeting item
that will deal with developing a single science plan. All SC members will have the
attached documents in their papers.
I'll summarise the few constraints we have at the start of the Monday session, so you
won't have to revisit the history; by the time we get to you, all will know that we have
the task of coming up with a single plan, and the events leading up to that
circumstance.
The constraints as I see them are:
The Rapid Climate Change programme has  a budget of 20m. The Abrupt proposal was
written to 16.9m, and the STB decided to invest 17.0m in thermohaline-related rapid
climate change. This proposal contained both palaeo and modelling components (as well as
modern observational/process work), and a strong complementarity and close working
relationship with Prescient was always envisaged by the writers. The Prescient proposal
was written to 8m, and the Prescient draft science plan (following reduced award) was
written to 4.5m. The STB did not have a discussion about how the science of the two
programmes should be combined, but the nature and chronology of events/discussions imply
that the STB decision to spend 17m on thermohaline-related work should be respected. I
do not see that this has to be translated as an inexorable shackling of the 4.5m
Prescient science aims, given that a good fraction of the Prescient draft science plan
seems to be potentially relevant to thermohaline-related climate change, and that there
is notionally 3m of the 20m that is not tied to thermohaline-related work, and there
is a strong palaeo/modelling element to Abrupt.
So much for constraints. I do not want to give the impression that we are after a
ring-fencing of Prescient and Abrupt monies and aims within Rapid.  I would hope that
there is scope for a much more integrated (in the sense of both palaeo/modern and
obs/model) and coherent programme than that. One potential conflict, in the modelling
context, seems to be the apparently regional approach of Abrupt cf the global approach
of Prescient. I suspect (but may be wrong) that there is a scientific debate to be had
as to whether an Atlantic-centric approach is sufficient to consider
thermohaline-related climate change over NW Europe, or whether a more global treatment
is required.
On practicalities, I've got you down for 20 minutes each, and have set aside half an
hour for discussion straight afterwards. Please let Catrin Yeomans (cvy@nerc.ac.uk)
know your audio-visual needs.
Get back to me if you need further clarification.
All the best,
Phil
