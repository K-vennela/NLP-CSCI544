*NSM Press Release:*
*Missouri's Governor publically denounces NSM as a hate group, as our legal
right to march is recognized by the State.*
Our retort to the Governors message below is this:  Gov Blunt may use his
website and the media outlets to call us a hate group, but we stand firmly
with the truth in hand, and majority White interests at heart. Gov. Blunt
may see our stance against illegal immigration as hate, he may see our
stance against crime & violence as hate, he may see our stance against
sending our young men and women off to wars of aggression in foreign lands
as hate, he may even see the fact that we stand as a White Civil Rights
group as hate. With that said the only hate we hear comes from Gov. Blunt
himself, blind hatred of those who speak out and stand for White Rights and
against the flood of illegal immigration here in our Homeland.
In a Conservative State like Missouri, it seems like a very bad Political
move on his part. While Gov. Blunt sits in his Ivory Tower casting stones,
and scoffing at the White working class citizens of Missouri, perhaps he
will recall this moment and understand why he won't be re-elected in the
future.
In Solidarity with the Blue Collar workers & working Middle class who want
an end to the illegal alien invasion of America.
