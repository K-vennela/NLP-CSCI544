Dear Keith,
we received your letters concerning our paper for Dendrochronologia
and three long chronologies.
1. As regards individual ring width data of living trees from
Yamal we would remind you that you have them. Stepan gave to you
in England one diskette. There are data for Larix sibirica from
three sites (KHA - from Khadyta river, 67812'N 69850'E; JAH -
from Yahody river 67807'N 69854'E and POR - from Portsa river
67827'N 71800'E) and for Picea obovata from two points (SCH -
Shtshutshya river 66849'N 69850'E and KHD - from Khadyta river
67807'N 69854'E).
2. We would be very gratefull if you can do some corrections and
additions in the paper for Dendrochronologia. We did not quite
understand what we have to do on missing rings? Just enumerate
years when missing rings occur? If so, these are following years:

We have to note that frequency of missing rings on increment
cores of living trees higher, because on samples of subfossil
trees we try to find this kind of rings on whole disc.
Some periods are notable for missing rings: 988-964 BC, 882 BC,
143 AD, 623-646 AD (especially 640 AD), 814-816-818 AD, 1453 AD
and beginning of 1800th AD.
3. Stepan ask what about book by Bailey?
