Dear All,
I'd just like to echo all the points made by Mike and Kevin. The 
logic behind saying that
there isn't enough paleo data before 1600 yet there may have been even 
early millennia which
experienced warming of almost 2 C per millennium escapes me. As Kevin 
points out they have
mixed up all the various factors that force climate on interannual to 
intermillennial timescales.
One of the main points of IPCC is to synthesize the science, with 
particular reference to
potential future changes. Changes in the distant past (glacial and 
deglaciation) are of less
relevance to the 21st century because of differences in boundary 
conditions. The last few hundred
to a thousand years are clearly more important to the near future. At 
least from my quick
reading there seems no explicit reference to changes in the thermohaline 
circulation.
Perhaps the paleo people on this list need to redouble their efforts 
to empahasize the
importance of the last few thousand years, stressing absolute dating, 
calibration and
verification.  Another issue that is mixed up in the report (apart from 
the forcing) is spatial
scales. I will try and address these at the Chicago meeting. What are the 
4 useful sites ?
I just hope in the US that people read the full IPCC reports and the 
summaries, rather
than this hastily cobbled together document. I also hope that Europeans 
don't read it. It has
already got some air time here and may get some more with Bush here this 
week.  Issues
like star wars and capital punishment were commented upon whilst I came 
to work. Kyoto
wasn't mentioned.
Cheers
Phil
