NSM West Coast Rolling Forward like a Freight Train:
NSM Leaders have picked up the pace in West Coast activism. Inspired by the Midwest activism, strength in the South, and East Coast. The Western NSM Chapters have stepped up their efforts. 
NSM Las Vegas recently held a Mexican Flag burning Protest (in uniform) in front of a Mexican strip mall in Vegas, pictures coming soon at www.nsm88.com  New contacts/membership being requested in Nevada has been the result. 
NSM Northwest just held a meeting in Portland, Oregon today. Approx. 2 dozen members and guests attended, pictures up now at www.nukeisrael.com 
NSM Arizona a newer addition to the NSM Family has been picking up a lot of steam. The veteran Leadership has been all over the State meeting current members, signing up new ones, and networking has begun in preperation for the possibility of a second NSM chapter in the State in upcoming months.
