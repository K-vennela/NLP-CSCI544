Hi Tim, I know Keith is out of commission for a while (give him my
regards when you see him), but someone needs to at least give some
context to the latest McIntyre meme. 
<<link>>
None of us at RC have any real idea what was done or why and so we are
singularly unable to sensibly counter the flood of nonsense. Of course,
most of the reaction is hugely overblown and mixed up but it would be
helpful to have some kind of counterpoint to the main thrust. If you can
point to someone else that could be helpful, please do!
Thanks
Gavin
