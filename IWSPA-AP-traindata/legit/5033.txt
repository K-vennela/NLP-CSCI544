Fellow National Socialists:

For 60 days now a battle has been waged behind the NSM scenes between the N=
SM Commander and a lot of NSM rank and file because of his web team consist=
ing of Mike Connelly, Cathy Griggs, and John Schafer. The NSM Commander has=
given them free authority to do as they please in the Forums and New Saxon=
without ever disciplining them. For six months, I have received steady req=
uests by NSM members and friends of the NSM to do something about the web t=
eam because of their tyrannical and unjust ways of banning people and cussi=
ng at people. Recently, I discovered a secret room in the Forums (so did Ji=
m Ramm) where they regularly meet and post messages about NSM members behin=
d their backs and the NSM Commander participates and allows it. This is bad=
character on the part of them all and the reason the NSM Commander expelle=
d me (I did not resign as he is telling people) and came up with that lie o=
f me and others being defeatist. Is defeatism running as the first National=
Socialist for President in the USA, 24/7, and giving up a $50,000 a year j=
ob to do so? Is defeatism being a National Socialist for over 33 years? Is =
defeatism running the first NSM candidate for office last year in Montana a=
nd obtaining 17.5% of the vote which is astounding?

Your Commander lies and undermines more than Bill White does. I don't agree=
with Bill White or like his tactics but I think he learned it from Jeff Sc=
hoep. Has the NSM Commander been honest with you and told you his reckless =
character got him a DUI and dues are paying the increased auto insurance pr=
emium along with the high price tag of his Mustang. Must be nice to live hi=
gh on the hog on your dues money and you see little in return.

Go ask Jeff Schoep what happened to that NSM Scholarship fund that NSM memb=
ers generously donated into? He will tell you it's (his puppet master John =
Schafer will back him up and lie for him) still there. It isn't! NSM Comman=
der told Nick Chappell at the Omaha Rally it was used to move the Commander=
and his family. If you don't believe it, have you seen it issued to any hi=
gh school student yet? Not.

Also, the NSM Commander has barely made any effort to push the 2008 Preside=
ntial election campaign. When people were making a fuss about his lack of e=
nthusiasm about it he would occasionally take up a collection once in awhil=
e (like the book burning and National Meeting). I accuse him of deliberatel=
y sabotaging it. He is a saboteur. His lack of effort along with the web te=
am chasing and banning potential contributors in the Forum away destroyed t=
he Presidential campaign.=20
=20
Also, the NSM Commander called the former NSM Viking Youth Corps Director a=
defeatist. Does a defeatist take his inheritance and buy a building so the=
NSM could regularly meet there and be safe?=20
Within the last week, the NSM Commander along with his web team and himself=
have lost the NW Regional Leader, NSM Viking Youth Corps Director, NSM Ele=
ction Director, Meeting Hall in SC, and its 2008 Presidential candidate, pl=
us so many members it would make your head spin. Notice he doesn't mention =
the number of NSM members that wrote him back about his e-mail about loyalt=
y and oath that resigned. I showed that e-mail to genuine German National S=
ocialists from the 1930's-1940's and they laughed at it explaining that he =
was wrong and isn't a National Socialist. They thought a Marxist wrote it a=
t first. They explained that the message conveys that NSM members are suppo=
se to have strict and faithful loyalty to their leader without question. Th=
ey point out that this isn't National Socialist thinking from the NSDAP bec=
ause a leader is suppose to have responsibility of making proper decisions =
downward. Responsibility comes with leadership and making decisions. The fo=
rmer NSDAP leaders explained that Schoeps interpretation was Marxist thinki=
ng or tyrannical thinking because the message insisted that everyone must b=
e loyal and faithful with nothing in return from the leadership. Go back an=
d read it yourself and you will see.=20

There will come a day when you get the boot. Remember my words here. In the=
meantime, I have a White House to take and my campaign continues. In fact,=
donations started to pour in again this morning because I don't have the N=
SM Commander sabotaging the election anymore.

PS. Captain Ludaka and the entire NW NSM have just resigned. Southern NSM U=
nits are doing the same. One more thing, the NSM Commander has lost the NSM=
Meeting Hall in SC as well. He's batting #1000 today.
