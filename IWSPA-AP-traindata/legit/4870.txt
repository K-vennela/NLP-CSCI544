Mr. Herring=2C
I received an email back from the Commander confirming your identity.  If y=
ou or someone from NSM would still like to speak with me then please=2C fee=
l free to give me a call.  If you receive my voicemail please leave me a me=
ssage and a number I can reach you.  I typically do not answer my phone whe=
n I do not recognize the number calling.  I also live in the mountains so I=
do not get signal on my cell when I am at home.

I sent a couple of emails to the Colorado POC but have not heard anything b=
ack from them.  I hope I haven't ruffled any feathers by my emails.  I am j=
ust tired of the organizations that represent the white race not having the=
foresight to actually take some action to work toward our goals or some of=
these idiots who cannot speak intelligently or persuasively and try to tak=
e stupid actions that actually hurt our "cause" instead of helping it.  A l=
ot of these organizations are political dinosaurs and they need to either e=
volve or stay out of the way of those who actually want to accomplish goals=
for our race.

Anyway=2C I always speak my mind until I see I shouldn't speak my mind.  I =
hope I haven't angered some in the NSM but if I have=2C tell them to give m=
e some of their time and I'll convince them I am right.  I convinced a blac=
k the other day that society is better when it is segmented into sections o=
f ethnicity so I figure I should be able to convince my own race of the sam=
e.  Of course=2C my plans and ideas are little bit more drastic but not muc=
h.

I hope to hear from you or the Commander soon.
