Hello! I want to download the hotfix, but FTP isn't working.The VPN-SSL connection is working and I can login to portal, but when I go to the File Transfer Area, it tell me "no route to host" (the server IP is 192.168.100.32). The Ticket support isn't working also, just I get a blank page. You sent a mail to my college Csaba Gal which is contain the path to the hotfix, but that path isn't worked for me because your sever told me "400 Bad Request, no required SSL certificate was sent"This link points to support.hackingteam.com. Our certicitate contains rcs-support.hackingteam.it. Hawe you any suggestions? Regards,Peter Baloghmail: balog.peter@nbsz.gov.huphone: +3630 695 0933
