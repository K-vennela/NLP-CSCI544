Ben,
Tim's idea is a possibility. I've not always got on that well great
with Glenn McGregor, but Tim seems to have a reasonable rapport
with him. Dian has suggested that this would be the best route - it
is the logical one. I also think that Glenn would get quick reviews, as
Tim thinks he realises he's made a mistake.
Tim has let me into part of secret. Glenn said the paper had two
reviews - one positive, the other said it wasn't great, but would leave it
up to the editor's discretion. This is why Glenn knows he made the wrong
choice.
The problem !! The person who said they would leave it to the editor's
discretion is on your email list!  I don't know who it is - Tim does -
maybe they have told you? I don't want to put pressure on Tim. He
doesn't know I'm sending this. It isn't me by the way - nor Tim !
Tim said it was someone who hasn't contributed to the discussion -
which does narrow the possibilities down!
Tim/Glenn discussed getting quick reviews. Whoever this person
is they could be the familiar reviewer - and we could then come up
with another reasonable name (Kevin - he does everything at the
speed of light) as the two reviewers.
Colour in IJC costs a bit, but I'm sure we can lean on Glenn.
Also we can just have colour in the pdf.
I'll now send a few thoughts on the figures!
Cheers
Phil
