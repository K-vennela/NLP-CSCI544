Numbers are a bit of a moving target.
Vaughn's still trying to figure out what the hell is going on with this Rudy guy and his $100k. That's coming with 4 seats so could be a bit touchy.
Bittel is being wishy washy on whether or not he's coming. Trying to lock down John Maa and it looks like Phil Munger is planning on coming but I don't have his money yet and I'm hearing it through the grapevine.
If everyone comes we're looking at 28. If all these clowns drop off we're looking at 20. Trying to shore it all up in the next hour.
And will definitely make sure Hoffman sees it before sending it to you.
Do you think I can take an extra few hours to get the seating chart? I have drinks with SIEU this evening and don't want to cancel. But will get it done before going to bed tonight.
