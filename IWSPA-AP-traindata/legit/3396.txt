Hi Tim et al (especially Valerie) - again, sorry for the confusion, 
but hopefully the emails sent and forwarded from Valerie and me this 
evening helps figure this out. I think we're going with borehole for 
Law Dome, but you guys need to confirm it's the way to go. I'm cc'ing 
to Valerie in the hope she can try to provide more guidance in this - 
with a confirmation that it's the best way to go and will stand up to 
criticism. If we have multiple conflicting temp recons from Law Dome, 
and one can't be shown from the literature as being the best, then we 
should state that, and show neither - just an idea. BUT, I think 
Valerie was pretty sure the borehole was best. She should be more 
available in a day or so.
Thanks all, cheers, Peck
