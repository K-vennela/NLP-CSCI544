Drew - we closed earlier this morning. Recognizing that Friday may be tight at this point we told Mark E that we'd try but couldn't guarantee.  
Here's my thought,  Greg can walk you through today so you have info you need for your team and Dave. 
Let me know if that doesn't work or if you prefer to handle differently. 
Thanks!
