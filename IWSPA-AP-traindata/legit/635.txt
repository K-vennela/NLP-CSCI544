Ideally, we would get her in early that morning (or the evening before if she prefers) and have her do a breakfast (or late morning) event potentially coupled with a few 1-on-1s thereafter.  We could get her out of Raleigh-Durham early afternoon (3/4 pm at the latest) and back to DC by that evening.  Let us know if that timeline is feasible; we can re-work!
