ZIKA CURVEBALL: The House's proposal for extra Zika funding is far different from what the Senate is likely to pass today, setting up an uncertain pathway for more funding to become law. The Senate is likely to approve a bipartisan compromise proposal from Sens. Patty Murray and Roy Blunt today that provides $1.1 billion in emergency funding to fight Zika, but the House's proposal unveiled yesterday is not emergency funding and provides $622 million in unspent ebola funding. Complicating things further: The THUD bill the Senate is aiming to attach Zika funding to is under a veto threat from the president. The result of the impasse could mean a weeks-long delay in actually providing the
funding. Democrats are signaling they are about to go on the attack over the matter and, perhaps, reprise Republicans' vicious 2014 knocking President Barack Obama's ebola strategy. "They are walking into a woodchipper," says one senior Democratic aide.
Nah, say Republicans: But Republicans say this is all just a temporary snag. In an interview with Huddle, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn sounded bullish that a compromise could be reached by convention season. "What we'll have to do is just reconcile what we pass here with what they do ... I don't really sense any hesitancy to do something. There just might be a slightly divergent pathway to the result. I think we'll get there," Cornyn said. 
I SMELL LIKE MONEY: The Koch network has plunked down $30 million in Senate battlegrounds, Ken Vogel reports this morning. The group is targeting Florida, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania in a round of ads scheduled to run in August and September. The group has already spent $12 million on Senate races. <<link>>
