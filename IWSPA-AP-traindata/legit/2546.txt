Is writing a piece on where the Foundation is now, architect narrowing down=
, the meetings last weekend, etc.  She is the White House/Washington corres=
pondent for the Tribune, and is going to be more involved with Foundation c=
overage as we move forward.  It is my sense that the Tribune has decided to=
become more aggressive in their coverage.  Katherine had reached out to Va=
lerie to appeal for help since we (I.e. Me) are so unhelpful! =20
She had a source saying the decision on the architect and the site would be=
late spring or early summer, she said that she had sources saying the numb=
er of architects has been narrowed down to three or four, she asked me on t=
he record if we were disappointed with our fundraising (I told her that the=
Foundation has consistently said we would only raise enough money to meet =
our operational needs until the President leaves the White House), she want=
ed details on the location of the meeting last Sunday, etc. =20
I know Amy spoke with her as well - needless to say, we are not commenting =
on any parts of the process right now, nor are we confirming number of arch=
itects, timing on announcements, etc.  But wanted to give this group a head=
s up that we have another Washington-based reporter joining the pack, and w=
e should expect to see more reporting out of the Tribune moving forward. =20
Lynn Sweet, watch out! =20
