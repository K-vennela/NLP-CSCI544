Crew,
An article in the Washington Post mentions mental
health screening. The whole article is basically an
appeal for more money by the grubby mental health
industry.
See the article below. Write a letter to the editor
and send it to user@domain.com.
You can write what you want. My suggestion is just to
use this opportunity to forward any true message about
psychiatry and the mental health system. You can write
about the false labels, lack of science, the dangers
of drugs, the evils of screening.
Don't mention TeenScreen by name but you can use all
the standard messages to point out that screening
systems are bad.
Report compliance by email.
Best,
Doyle
