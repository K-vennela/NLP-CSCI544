Hi Tim
I've found some 'communicating cc' ref's which I've attached - nothing too 
hard going! Futerra's 'rules of the game' is a good intro to what climate 
change communicators should be working towards in terms of best practice. 
Sophie's poster is a summary of the main findings of her PhD research from a 
couple of years back in ENV, and is a message that some NGOs in particular 
would still do well to heed! Finally, the communicating CC document is an 
outline of Defra's recent initiative, as followed on from Futerra's 
consultancy work.
PhD stuff: at the last panel meeting, we agreed to meet again in early 
October. However, I think this meeting would best be delayed until we know 
exactly what info we can obtain for the expert elicitation as r.e. ice 
extent maps, time series etc.
I forwarded on the email from Xiangdong Zhang a few days ago - he's happy to 
give me some plots showing 2-D distribution of sea ice concentrations around 
2050 and also animations from 1900-2100 under the A1B scenario.
How is the ice modelling going? Do you think you'd be able to get some plots 
say by w/c 9th Oct so we could talk about them in the meeting?
Cheers
Saffron
