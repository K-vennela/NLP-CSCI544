Hi Fortunat et al - glad you have the forcing and can get it out to 
Anders/Stefan et al. Please do so with recommendations (perhaps 
building on mine, but suggest what you think is best) for 
experimental setup - what complete set of forcings should be used, 
etc.
Please note that we'd like (can we get from both of your groups??) 
simulated climate to present in two forms:  1) with natural (Lean 
solar plus volc) plus anthropogenic forcing and 2) with natural only 
also. It would be good if the results from your runs  (Swiss and 
German) were directly comparable with each other.
Also, please note that I'm waiting for everyone to return to the TSU 
and let us know the official schedule for the next couple months. 
There is a finite chance that we'll need your runs, and the figures 
(which Keith and Tim Osborn will be drafting) well BEFORE the end of 
January. The reason for this is that this material will be used in 
the next draft of the TS/SPM (and will need iteration), and we are 
also likely to be under pressure to have all our figures out for 
broader WG1 review in January. So, we hope you can speed things up to 
be run sooner in Jan. OK?
I tried to attach the Christchurch Chap 6 plenary talk, but my phone 
line is not allowing it today. Will send soon. The figure that is 
being considered (wanted, might be the better word) for the TS is the 
one on the upper right of page 7 of the pdf I will send.
Please keep me, Eystein, and Keith in the loop as things develop. It 
would be great to know what your planned completion date is once you 
have things running (hopefully soon, pretty please... - we can't 
afford to be late with things anymore)
Many thanks! Peck
