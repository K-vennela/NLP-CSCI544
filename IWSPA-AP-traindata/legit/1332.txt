Tom,
Obviously don't pass on!  These proofs have gone back with
about 60 changes to be made. Should be out first issue of 2009.
The bet is that CA will say they found that the IPCC Figure from 1990
was a Lamb diagram 6 months ago. They did, but they didn't
get the right source, and our paper was submitted in early 2008. CA
will also comment on the section on pp21-31. The summary of
where we are with the individual proxies is useful for most of them -
but we didn't get anyone working with speleothems involved. I
remain unconvinced they get the resolution claimed. Yet to see
a speleothem paper which doesn't compare their (individual site) reconstruction with
either the MBH series or a solar proxy.
I hope Ben gets the support from PCMDI and LLNL.
Cheers
Phil
