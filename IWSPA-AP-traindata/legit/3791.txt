Warwick,
I did not think I would get a chance today to look at the web page.
I see what boxes you are referring to. The interpolation procedure cannot
produce larger anomalies than neighbours (larger values in a single
month). If you have found any of these I will investigate. If you are
talking about larger trends then that is a different matter. Trends
say in Fig 2.9 for the 1976-99 period require 16 years to have data
and at least 10 months in each year. It is conceivable that at there are
24 years in this period that missing values in some boxes influence
trend calculation.
I would expect this to be random across the globe.
Cheers
Phil
Warwick,
Been away.  Just checked my program and the interpolation shouldn't
produce larger anomalies than the neighbouring cells. So can you send
me the cells, months and year of the two cells you've found ? If I
have this I can check to see what has happened and answer (1).
As for (2) and (3) we compared all stations with neighbours and these
two stations did not have problems when the work was done (around 1985/6).
I am not around much for the next 3 weeks but will be here most of
this week and will try to answer (1) if I get more details. If you have
the names of stations that you've compared Olenek and Verhojansk with
I would appreciate that.
Cheers
Phil
