Keith,
Attached is the Stendel et al paper (submitted to "Climate Dynamics" last month) and a
corrected version of their Figure 3 (using the correct Mann and Jones NH series).
The importance of this paper is that they use the same model as von Storch (higher
resolution in fact), and get a temperature history that looks much like the
reconstructions/other models. Also, they appear to get the negative NAO pattern in the
Maunder Minimum, which von Storch et al do not...
Again, this should be referenceable in the zero order draft, but would be good to contact
Martin Stendel first about this...
Mike
