Ed
just back from really sunny Austria and very pleasant south of France. Have talked at
length with Jan and he says it is fine to send the raw and detrended cores series
(segmented for each site if possible). Do you also have a convenient Table with the Lats
and Longs you used to plot the sites map? This would mean I don't have to look them all up.
I will phone to report on our discussions and ask several things that arose from these.
Just have to do essential other stuff first - so probably tuesday afternoon (my time) Do
you have that review yet?
love and kisses
Keith
