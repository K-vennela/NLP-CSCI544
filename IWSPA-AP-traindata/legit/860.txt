I'm back in town.  I tried giving you a call but there was no answer so if =
you want to call my cell is 612-345-2141.
See what you=92re getting into=85before you go there. Check it out! Sorry a=
bout the delay. The cell phone is temporarily turned off, but the house pho=
ne is 235-5004. We are having another rally in Omaha on Sept. 1st. Would yo=
u and your lady be interested in going? It will be on the steps of the Mexi=
can Consulate, and we need all the white patriots we can muster for this on=
e. My girlfriend cannot go as she is almost 8 months pregnant, but perhaps =
if you are interested in going, we could share the cost of gas. Its only 8 =
hours south, so it would not be a huge financial burden. Let me know. Heil =
Hitler!
