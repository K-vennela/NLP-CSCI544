THE BIG IDEA:
Paul Ryan considers the late Jack Kemp one of his greatest mentors. The Spe=
aker of the House described himself last month as "a Jack Kemp-Ronald Reaga=
n Republican."
"Donald Trump is a Donald Trump Republican," he added.
When he announced last week that he=E2=80=99s not ready to support the pres=
umptive Republican nominee, he said he wants Trump to change first. =E2=80=
=9CThis is the party of Lincoln, of Reagan, of Jack Kemp,=E2=80=9D Ryan sai=
d on CNN. =E2=80=9CWhat a lot of Republicans want to see is that we have a =
standard bearer that bears our standards.=E2=80=9D
As Ryan meets with Trump this morning, to try making nice, the legacy of th=
e 1996 vice presidential nominee will hang heavily over him.
Kemp, a Buffalo Bills star, who served nine terms as a congressman from New=
York and then became HUD Secretary under George H.W. Bush after a failed 1=
988 bid for the Republican presidential nomination, passed away in 2009. In=
January, the Kemp Foundation hosted a forum on poverty in South Carolina. =
