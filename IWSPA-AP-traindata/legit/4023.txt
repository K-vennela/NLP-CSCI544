Good Tuesday morning. DRIVING THE DAY -- "Trump closes out Indiana by looking past it ... pivots to Hillary," by Ben Schreckinger in South Bend: "Trump is over this primary. On the eve of [today's] Indiana's vote, with polls showing him well ahead of Ted Cruz, Trump spent his final day of campaigning here ... touting general election polling, lunching with [Ed Klein, the author of books that repeat salacious allegations against Bill and Hillary Clinton] ...
"[Trump said in South Bend:] 'Women are looking for security in our country and they know I'm going to do the best job ... When they called her on Benghazi she was sleeping, folks.'" <<link>>
