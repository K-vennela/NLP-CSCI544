Sorry for the delay.
We are in this weird Catch 22 about this.  The WH team (Chuck Kennedy) =
went back through the digital photos they took and could not find =
anything.  The political photographer for Wolf went through her photos =
and could not find anything; we went through our photos because the DNC =
had their own event there that day for a roundtable and we had nothing.
Does he remember who took it? Is it possible we are looking at the wrong =
person? This is the Fran Dunphy everyone is looking for.  Sorry this is =
such a pain - it will turn up.=20
