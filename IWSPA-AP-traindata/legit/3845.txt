Hi Amy....There is an amazing renowned home in Palm Springs known as the Edris House completed by E. Stewart Williams in 1954 and photographed by Julius Shulman. The owner of the home is a good friend and at times he has talked about selling the home he restored. 
He gave me permission to share with you a website he built to describe the home. It provides a terrific overview of the property past and present. The address:
www.edrishouse.com 
The home is original and though it may not have the square footage you may desire...it is an iconic residence.
I spoke with him this morning about your interest in owning a home with an architectural pedigree and he said to forward the website to see what you thought. He is truly contemplating selling but it is in the very initial stages.
Feel free to let me know any comments or questions. 
The best,
Bill
