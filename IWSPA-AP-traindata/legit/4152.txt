I do think that the assault rifle approach would surely get attentio=
n, just not the right kind. Another major issue facing your organization as=
well as other similar groups, is the strong dislike of what they general p=
ublic "think" you represent. For instance, the public has a very strong neg=
ative view of white robes and hoods, swastikas, etc. Those were some of the=
primary tools of some of history's "less favored" moments to most. I wonde=
r what would happen, if a group were to try a different approach. Same beli=
efs, different methods. Instead of SA uniforms that so many associate with =
the Nazi's from WWII (we both know how popular they are to the majority), m=
aybe a new uniform designed by a new modern generation of Aryans. Instead o=
f carrying the Swastika flag, maybe design a new symbol that so many don't =
already know and hate. That wouldn't be hard either, Hitler didn't design t=
he swastika after all. It's been a sign of happiness on Buddhist temples in=
Asia for centuries. Instead of saying "Niggers" at rallies, maybe just "bl=
acks". Not that I don't call them niggers because that=92s what they are, b=
ut that causes an uproar with the many liberals that unfortunately are in p=
ositions of power. People do not hear the actual message then, they just th=
ink here are a bunch of ignorant white trash up here waving flags and yelli=
ng. I'm just wondering if we presented ourselves to the public in a differe=
nt manner, would we see more support and better results. I have thought a l=
ot about this, and feel that you have as well from you saying "To effect ch=
ange, one must use their intellect and strategy to win this war." =20
We need to first change the way we are viewed by the people we are tr=
ying to reach. Then we need to show actual facts and statistics instead of =
the typical negative commentary that goes nowhere. We need the people to se=
e that the Niggers are NOT equal. They are by nature, savages, criminals th=
at think everything should be handed to them. Our prison, crime, drug, etc.=
statistics show this information. The blacks like to call it stereotyping,=
or singling them out. Then they use the race card that our weak government=
and judicial system caters to their constant complaining from fear of laws=
uits. Now given back sixty years ago, in this very country, the blacks kept=
to themselves. It was rare to hear of blacks rioting, attacking a white wo=
man, or committing crimes against whites in general. That's because we had =
segregation. The black had their place and we had ours and the two did not =
mix. The crime was mostly in the ghetto's and slums amongst the blacks them=
selves. They knew that if they crossed the line, they would have to answer =
for what they done. Nobody to complain to and get off free of any responsib=
ility or punishment, and the crime was usually quickly followed with a whip=
ping or hanging. We had strict and swift punishment then, and they stayed i=
nline. The government screwed up when they gave them new freedom. They gave=
an inch, the blacks took a mile. They have started reverting back to their=
primitive ways and causing chaos in our society. Instead of the warring tr=
ibes of Africa, we have street gangs at war. They are a lesser species of t=
he human race. There are so many highly qualified white men in our=20
nation's workforce passed up for promotions or a job at all because they ha=
ve to allow so many blacks to work there and so many blacks must be advance=
d to better jobs even though their skills, education, and qualification are=
inferior to their white counterparts. I do have a personal opinion of colo=
red people though. I have worked with "Black People", and I have worked wit=
h "Niggers"! I think some blacks have started to evolve into a more civiliz=
ed society. These are they ones that are not living on the taxpayer's dolla=
r. They usually live outside the slums and ghettos, work everyday, stay out=
of trouble, finish school, raise their children in a civilized manner, etc=
. I have a degree of respect for them. If they work for what they have the =
same way that I do, then I have no problem with the man. The niggers on the=
other hand, are the ones that try and get out of as much work as they can =
pass on to their co-workers. Just their to draw a paycheck, usually the emp=
loyer gets fed up and can't fire or discipline the nigger because he'll be =
sued for discrimination. Now, that's just the niggers just have jobs. The o=
nes too stupid to go into illegal business. Such as drug dealing or theft r=
ings. You may or may not agree with me on that. That's just my opinion thou=
gh. I've ranted on long enough in this email. I hope you'll agree with me o=
n most of it. I'm twenty seven years old, but I'd love to be able to see a =
change in my lifetime. For our future generation's sake anyway!
