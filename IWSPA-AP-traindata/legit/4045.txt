Hello, Kirsten,I hope all's well with you, even with the current tumultuou=
s political landscape surrounding us all=C2=A0~Carol Pensky and I=C2=A0send=
you our warm personal wishes with=C2=A0this message.
On=C2=A0a conference call=C2=A0with the DNC=C2=A0last week concerning ideas=
for WLF's presence at the Philadelphia=C2=A0Convention, we=C2=A0all discus=
sed the importance of WLF --=C2=A0and=C2=A0also of "Off the Sidelines" -- =
=C2=A0being highlighted there during a prime daytime slot.=C2=A0 We also th=
ought it should NOT be=C2=A0thru a fundraising event.
Trusting that your plans are still open for the Convention, we would like t=
o propose holding a joint event with OTS and WLF, possibly a festive recept=
ion to be underwritten by a woman's magazine or other suitable sponsor, Tue=
sday afternoon, July 26th, 2:00-4:00PM.=C2=A0 We would focus on you as the =
special star=C2=A0attraction of this event.=C2=A0 The idea makes complete s=
ense to us since you are the member of Congress who has done the absolute m=
ost for Democratic women candidates the past several cycles.=C2=A0 The even=
t would give you a platform to highlight your efforts, as well as include a=
WLF message pointing out the importance of women's involvement in the Demo=
cratic Party, and serving as the women's host for the DNC.
FYI, EMILY's List and Emerge are also holding gatherings that week, EMILY o=
n Wednesday 7/27, =C2=A03-5PM and Emerge on Tuesday 7/26,=C2=A04-7PM.
***NOTE: Since drafting the above paragraphs last Friday, 5/20, a new, impo=
rtant=C2=A0potential scenario developed over the weekend concerning the int=
erest and availability of Amahl and George Clooney in joining this event!=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 Amahl and George said they=C2=A0met you,=C2=A0were most impres=
sed with you as a Senator and a leader, and would enjoy being associated wi=
th you at the Convention, as well.
The above info came back to me over the weekend=C2=A0from Jae Kim, a former=
New York WLF (and WLFN) member who now lives in Vancouver.=C2=A0 Jae has b=
een best friends=C2=A0with Amahl for years (bridesmaid at her wedding, etc.=
) Jae is also=C2=A0a good friend of mine, someone I mentored in the years s=
he lived in NYC.=C2=A0 While discussing WLF's Convention plans with Jae las=
t Friday, I mentioned the=C2=A0WLF-OTS idea,=C2=A0then we digressed to the =
possibility of the Clooneys attending the Convention.=C2=A0 As a result, sh=
e asked if it was=C2=A0acceptable=C2=A0to call Amahl=C2=A0and George over t=
he weekend=C2=A0to see whether they were attending the Convention, mention =
the possibility of OTS and WLF joining together that week, and see what the=
ir plans were. Jae spoke to them Saturday and=C2=A0as a result, they=C2=A0s=
uggested the following:
George Clooney=C2=A0has been invited to speak at the Convention (hasn't=C2=
=A0 accepted yet but feels it's very important=C2=A0this year, and is tendi=
ng toward accepting), and=C2=A0if he does accept, then=C2=A0both=C2=A0of th=
em would like to do a joint event with you, OTS, and WLF.=C2=A0 Jae explain=
ed the importance of WLF's role in organizing women thru the Democratic Par=
ty, and Amahl and George quickly agreed with the idea.
I have asked the DNC to prepare a Fact Sheet about the potential event to b=
e emailed to you and to the Clooney's personal assistant this week.
Finally, Carol and I realize we have taken a "special friend" advantage=C2=
=A0 by contacting you directly (indeed, you are a special friend) and it wi=
ll be followed up by=C2=A0the official invitation from the DNC Chair after =
our informal exploration of these ideas.=C2=A0 We hope this plan holds a gr=
eat appeal to you as well, we think it would make a big impression on women=
at the Convention and beyond, and we look forward to hearing from you.=C2=
=A0 Thanks, Kirsten ~ !
With all best wishes,Cynthia and Carol
