Well that is a pickle for you.  It seems silly to me to try and force something that would be less than successful just because that weekend works in their time.
I would just tell them the truth and explain what is happening. Did we request that weekend or did they give it to us? Can we go anywhere else in the country.    Ask Clayton about Nebraska and Wyoming. I think if we can be proactive in helping them cross off this list it would help when we give them bad news.
