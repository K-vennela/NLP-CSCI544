Comrade- We are facing these issues with every march and rally we sponser. =
It is definitely an uphill battle, but we are taking steps and putting fort=
h measures to deal with these very issues. We don't march in uniform for fu=
n.... And, we are also planning to run candidates in several local and stat=
e elections in the very near future. You are absolutely right of course. We=
must be legally elected into respected positions of authority to effect po=
sitive change. Believe me friend, we know all too well what must be done, a=
nd we are working on this overtime. It pleases me so much to see a white ma=
n with the proper attitudes and ideas. We recieve so many e-mails from kook=
s and crazies wanting to whip out assault rifles and start killing. Temptin=
g(HA!), but what an idiodic attitude. To effect change, one must use their =
intellect and strategy to win this war. Intelligence and cunning are the ha=
llmarks and the legacy of the Aryan people. It is what has allowed us to su=
rvive and to thrive. Take heart comrade. Thousands of dedicated and intelli=
gent Aryans are on top of this, and we will not let our kinsmen down. 88!  =

Sincerely,                                                     =
