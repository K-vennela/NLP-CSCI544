Rep. Chris Van Hollen has won the Democratic primary to replace retiring Sen. Barbara Mikulski in Maryland, defeating Rep. Donna Edwards tonight.
Van Hollen had 56 percent to 37 percent for Edwards with 14 percent of precincts reporting, when The Associated Press called the race. (See results here.)
Van Hollen had the support of Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and many of Maryland's prominent elected Democrats, but Edwards' campaign won strong support from African-American voters and EMILY's List, which spent millions of dollars on her behalf. Van Hollen's own campaign significantly outraised Edwards, though.
Van Hollen is unlikely to face a serious general election challenge in deep-blue Maryland.
