HI Mark,
Thanks for your comments, and sorry to any of you who don't wish to receive 
these correspondances...
Indeed, I have provided David Halpern with a written set of comments on the 
offending paper(s) for internal use, so that he was armed w/ specifics as 
he confronts the issue within OSTP. He may have gotten additional comments 
from other individuals as well--I'm not sure. I believe that the matter  is 
in good hands with Dave, but we have to wait and see what happens. In any 
case, I'd be happy to provide my comments to anyone who is interested.
I think that a response to "Climate Research" is not a good idea. Phil and 
I discussed this, and agreed that it would be largely unread, and would 
tend to legitimize a paper which many of us don't view as having passed 
peer review in a legitimate manner. On the other hand, the in prep. review 
articles by Jones and Mann (Rev. Geophys.), and Bradley/Hughes/Diaz 
(Science) should go along way towards clarification of the issues (and, at 
least tangentially, refutation of the worst of the claims of Baliunas and 
co). Both should be good resources for the FAR as well...
cheers,
mike
p.s. note the corrections to some of the emails in the original
