Friends=2C
Today=2C as I've expected since the beginning of this campaign=2C Keith Wr=
ight will be endorsed by Charlie Rangel for New York's 13th Congressional=
District.
It's not surprising=2C but will not change the fact that our community wan=
ts a fresh start with new leadership.
Over the past weeks=2C I have been engaging voters across every corner of=
this District=2C and I hear the same thing over and over.  Voters are fed=
up with politics as usual.
Keith Wright is a poster-child for politics as usual.  His track record of=
empty promises and half-truths - [on affordable housing - link to chart]=
=2C [minimum wage - link to story] and guns - reflects what is wrong in A=
lbany.  Keith Wright is wrong -- for our city and for Congress.
Over this final stretch of the campaign=2C I will keep making my case for=
change and progress in NY-13.  I hope to bring my 20+ years of experience=
serving the interests of families in this community and nationally=2C [i=
ncluding work for both Presidents Clinton and Obama - link to bio]=2C to C=
ongress.
I hope to win the endorsement that really matters:  from the voters in the=
13th Congressional District.
Please join our effort to help bring our community together (<<link>>
