Simon,
Could you - or Vanessa - buy a THES today from the paper shop and check this out.  I would
quite like to draft a short letter to THES as suggested by Steve.  But I need to see how
the issue was presented in this week's issue.
Thanks,
Mike

Dear Mike,
thanks for that. I feel terrible but despite the pain it cost to reply to the survey,
the deadline has now passed. We had such a high response rate that we decided to run the
piece in this week's paper while the issue of the US withdrawl from the protocol was
still high in everyone's mind. So I cannot include your responses. However, you make a
number of very significant points, not least your reply to question 2 on the strength of
the evidence and the political framework outlined in your final sentences. I wonder -
and I know this is pushing it - whether you might consider rearranging some of these
sentences to form a brief letter to the editor for the following week's paper? I would
like this issue to stay alive in the THES and allow the paper to play a small role in
persuading as many scientists as possible to take part in a scientific/political debate
that may contribute to influencing those people who *can* change things. Not an original
objective, I know, but the THES does have a fairly unique position within the academic
community and hence a responsibility. Anyhow, sorry for the bad news
best wishes
Steve

Steve,
I hate these sort of questionnaires since Y or N answers are barely
adequate.  However, I've given it a go with some other comments .............
(by the way, Prof. Trevor Davies is Head of my School here at UEA - I am
only Director of a Centre within the School, albeit a highly relevant one!).
You can quote me if appropriate, but let me know before hand.
Mike
