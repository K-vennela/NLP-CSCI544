ST. 1st Class Herring,
The only people that think the NSM is falling apart are the drama queens we
tossed out. Most people that don't talk to them are already in better
spirits now that the drama is away from us. If you wish to continue
communications with them, perhaps tell them you do not wish to hear negative
bs about our Party. Check out the NSM Watch site now,
<<link>>    Its now NSM Watching! Perhaps if
Nick or whomever else wants to continue with the drama they will find more
problems too. I have no desire to fight with any of them, but if they make
attacks on the NSM, they can expect a shovel of sh*t back in their faces. I
won't back down to those who wish to drag the Party down. I have an e-mail
from Jim Ramm where he says that he wants to give nukeisrael.com to the ADL,
anyone that collaborates with Ramm now is a traitor. Nick went on the
Vonbluvens show calling me a con-man, theif, etc, Von is Bill White's right
hand man, these guys have no Honor and I am glad they are gone. We are
stronger now without them. Steel your resolve Brother. I am not angry with
you at all, I understand your anger about this 100%, after all these years I
think I am becoming desensitized to drama. I appreciate your fire for the
Party, the key is to stay focused. If I were you and Angela, I would block
Nick from your messenger contacts, if he is upsetting you in this way. Here
is my #320-583-2380 if you ever would rather call me. 88 Commander Schoep
