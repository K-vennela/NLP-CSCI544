Nigel & Steven,
We originally had SMURFS 3 in September (9/10) but it has since moved back to 2016 ….so it’s a possibility for HOTEL T 2 to come up to September….but the key issue is school holiday timing.....& to capture them… we’d have to go out ideally two weeks prior (Sept 10) to the USA (Sept 25). McDonalds usually asks for a decent enough lead-time to sell-in & promote.
Our 2 week holidays commence on Sept 18 in the three main states of NSW/VIC/QLD and in the other states on the 25th Sept. 
Competition is Miss Peregrines Home For Peculiar Children on Sept 10 and Dreamworks’ Bureau Of Other Worldly Operations on Sept 17. We would not want to date against the latter…and Sept. 24 is too late to do the business we need.
There is about $40mil+ available of B.O. for family films during the Sept holidays…noting they are only a short 2 week duration…whilst equally…the lead into Christmas is also a very good & long less intense holiday trading period !
