1) Not great news out of Tauton last night.  I thought Taunton was this =
idyllic place with oak lined streets, wide sidewalks and the lapping of =
the ocean in the background.  It sounds like Joliet, IL.
2) Shervin is testing the interlooper or something like that in the =
Nevada dessert; it is the designed to get people from LA to SF in 30 =
minutes.  It was the third story on the Today show behind Taunton.
3) Thanks again for your time yesterday.  I really appreciate your =
advice and candy on all of this stuff - it is very helpful to have a =
calming voice in a sea of craziness.
Thanks - Jordan=20
