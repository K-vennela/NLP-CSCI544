Mike,
FYI.
I met this guy in Utrecht last week at Albert Klein Tank's PhD ceremony. It appears from
many media reports that people really believe that their run is an ALTERNATE to yours -
based
on no proxy data.  Even Hans has sent an email around to this effect, but he obviously
isn't
making it as clear as I've just done to this Dutch journalist. I think he might be being
clear with
fellow scientists and economical with the truth with journalists, i.e. not directing them
down the
correct path when he sees them going down the wrong one.
I should see Ray next week in Seattle at a DoE meeting.
Cheers
Phil
Dear Karel,
I have only got back from a meeting this morning. I see you have also had a long reply
from
Mike Mann about the von Storch paper.
Basically the von Storch et al paper is a discussion of the methodology used in the
Mann,
Bradley Hughes papers from 1998, 1999. It doesn't contain any new nor any observed proxy
data. It is entirely a model study. Therefore, it cannot produce a record for the last
millennium,
it cannot claim that the Medieval Warm Period was warmer than today, nor that the Little
Ice
Age may have been colder than MBH says.
It is really alarming that many media people (including yourself) have been taken in.
What the
von Storch et al paper is about is a climate model run - just one simulation. All it uses
is
an estimate of past variations in solar forcing and volcanic eruptions and more recently
anthropogenic changes in greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols.
As I said the paper in a methodological critique of MBH, nothing more than that. It IS
NOT
an alternative to MBH. It also not based on ANY paleoclimatic data. If you believe it, you
are putting everything on the model being correct and that their best guess at the past
history
of forcing as being correct.
Regards
Phil
