Hi Tim,
in response to your inquiry about my take on the confidentiality of my email communications
with you, Keith or Phil, I have to say that the intent of these emails is to reply or
communicate with the individuals on the distribution list, and they are not intended for
general 'publication'. If I would consider my texts to potentially get wider dissemination
then I would probably have written them in a different style. Having said that, as far as I
can remember (and I haven't checked in the records, if they even still exist) I have never
written an explicit statement on these messages that would label them strictly
confidential.
Not sure if this is of any help, but it seems to me that it reflects our standard way of
interaction in the scientific community.
Caspar
