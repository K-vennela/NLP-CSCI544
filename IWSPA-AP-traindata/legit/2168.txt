Dear Keith,
attached file contains results of analysis of anomalous rings in Yamal
material for 100BC - 2000 AD.
I forgot to inform you about one more thing. We have
organized data bank of Russian tree-ring chronologies.
Unfortunately (for you), in Russian.
<<link>>
(and then  click on the icon in the bottom (in center) of page).
This databank is made for archeologists and people that need to date
woody constructions and etc. The aim is to give them information about
where and what kind of chronologies there are in Russia. For some
locations chronology is available or links to other databanks, for
others - information only. Site is still filling up. If you are
interested to see you can ask Vladimir Shishov to translate. By the
way, you can remind him about my request to place chronologies of their
lab in this bank.
Best regards
