Martin,
You are right, it should just be the two of us and as Keith is just across the corridor
we can have the meeting beforehand or on the way together. If you add this though to
your list of possible meetings you might find that some others are interested. This
meeting of 3 and 6 can occur at the same time as 3 and 4, so during Cluster B. There
does need to be some discussion between 4 and 6 though to decide where Oerlemans
work is best located within AR4.
There is also the issue of Ch 9 as Kevin mentioned. As with Ch 4 using an NCEP
temperature series for the Arctic, there might be issues with some other chapters
using observed datasets which Ch 3 might think inappropriate or saying things about
them that differ from what we do.  Hopefully all these sorts of issues which get flagged
when the overviews of the whole of AR4 get discussed (and also at LA3 and LA4).
Cheers
Phil
