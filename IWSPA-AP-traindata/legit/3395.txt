All, I spoke with Ken Browne who is not only a contract developer but jvs with the Macks here and others on large scale residential projects, so a value add
person in this case.
We spoke and he can assemble a team of experts needed for the inspection/future build out including engineers, architects etc he uses as needed.
If we do not like any of his choices, we can easily reach out for others.
