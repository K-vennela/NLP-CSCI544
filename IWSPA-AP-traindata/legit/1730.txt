Need a quick TeenScreen comment.

Click on the above link and read the short article
which mentions TeenScreen.
Then scroll down to the bottom of the page and write
your comments.
You can write what you want. If you need hatting go to
www.psychsearch.net/teenscreen.html
I do have a request though. If your last name ends in
A-B, J-M or T-Z, include the TeenScreen petition link
in your letter. Here's the link
<<link>>
And if your last name ends in C, H or S, I'd like you
to also write an email to the reporter. Tell him to
dig a little deeper next time, to find out the full
truth about TeenScreen or something like that.
And report compliance by email.
Thank you,
Doyle
