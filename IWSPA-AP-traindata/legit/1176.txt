Thanks Keith,
I just read your email after reading the others. We actually eliminate records with
negative correlations (this is mentioned breifly in the GRL article,), and we investigated
a variety of weighting schemes to assure the basic robustness of the composite--but I
certainly endorse your broader point here. Many of these records have some significant
uncertainties or possible sources of bias, and this isn't the place to get into that. The
uncertainties get at this, at some level, and other places (e.g. the Reviews of Geophysics
paper Phil and I are drafting) will provide an opportunity to discuss these kinds of issues
in more detail--we will certainly be seeking advice (either officially or unofficially)
from each of you once we have finalized the draft of that...
Now back to my honeymoon...
