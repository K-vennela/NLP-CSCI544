I'll read it more thoroughly later.  My quick impression, more from the abstract than the
main text, is that you are defensive and it almost seems that there is a denial of the UHI
in part.  Yet later in the abstract and nicely in the first two sentences of the
conclusions, you recognize that the UHI is real and the climate is different in cities.
The point is that the homogenization takes care of this wrt the larger scale record and
