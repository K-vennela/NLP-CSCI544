ST. 1st Class Herring,
NS greetings again, and no I am not angry or offended. In fact I am pleased
to hear that your resolve in the Party is solidified, thats exactly the
attitude we need to move forward. There is so much work to be done, it is
difficult at times to even know where to start (ha ha).
Again, it is good to hear that you are not letting these drama queens bring
you down, I often wonder if they realize how they serve the enemy with their
bs? Oh well, thats on their conscience not mine. 88 Commander Schoep
