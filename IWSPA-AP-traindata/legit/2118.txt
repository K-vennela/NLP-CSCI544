Mike,
On Horizon, I'm supposed to be called in a few minutes by someone. Not sure who
yet. This program is generally good. They did something on global dimming a few months
ago and now want to do something on the truth about global warming, IPCC and
skeptics.
That's all I know so far. Person's name is Paul Olding. Should be calling
at 2pm, so 5 minutes time.
Cheers
Phil
