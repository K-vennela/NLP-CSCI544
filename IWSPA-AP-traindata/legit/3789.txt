Dear Steve,
AZ510.crn is a bristlecone pine chronology.  I suspect the others you are
working with are ponderosa pine or Douglas-fir.  In this region, these
lower-elevation species have quite a different response to climate than the
bristlecone.   I haven't worked with the AZ510 chronology, but I would
guess that bristlecone tree growth at this site would be favored by warm
winter temperatures and perhaps somewhat drier conditions, while the
ponderosa and Douglas-fir do well under cool, wet winter conditions.  This
may be the reason for your poor correlations.
regards,
Connie Woodhouse
