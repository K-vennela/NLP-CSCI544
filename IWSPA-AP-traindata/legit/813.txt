SS Herring,
You know I will ask you every now and then about answering e-mails, don't
get so defensive (ha ha). I am simply checking to make sure all the spark
plugs are firing in the NSM V-12 engine.
Good to hear the drama is being squashed with the local byrds, and yes I
will see you in Nov. trying to bring as much extra troop support in as
possible for that. 88
