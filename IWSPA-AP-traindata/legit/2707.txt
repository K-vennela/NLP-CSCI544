Hi, just for clarification as we continue on the 
St.2 proposal (youll get the mailing tomrrow 
with documents, scheduling etc. as planned).
The merger of ICON into Imprint was discussed 
several times in the preparatory phase of Imprint 
(before name was decided) in meetings we had in 
London early last year. However a number of the 
present WP leaders did not take part in these 
early deliberations, hence this is the reason for 
the  lack of a collective memory of the 
background.
Reasons for including it:
1. Good science,on a topic of high relevance 
(abrupt climate change) focussed and with 
emphasis on aspects dealing with preedictability 
of such changes rather than mapping out their 
distribution and impact (as has been done before).
3. Important to avoid competing proposals within 
urope to avoid the paleo-community being 
marginalised.
Cheers,
Eystein
