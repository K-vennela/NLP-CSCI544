I spoke to Adam earlier and gave him my general thoughts on Act 3 and talked to him about the idea of aging Dennis up a bit and giving him more of a POV.  He was hesitant and said he needed to think about it, so I said I would write up some specific thoughts and ideas.  He also asked for my specific suggestions for act 3.  So after the general notes, I do get pretty specific and they are not as conversational.  I do suggest getting rid of Cakey all together since he really makes Dennis play babyish -- and he is still being used to scare the fangs out of Dennis in Act 3 so if we keep that idea it may need to be a generic superhero.
Let me know your thoughts as soon as possible and I can get him one set of notes.
