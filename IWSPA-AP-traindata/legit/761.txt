Dear folks,
On April 11th, I received an email from Prof. Glenn McGregor at IJoC. I 
am now forwarding that email, together with my response to Prof. McGregor.
Prof. McGregor's email asks for my opinion of an "Addendum" to the 
original DCPS07 IJoC paper. The addendum is authored by Douglass, 
Christy, Pearson, and Singer. As you can see from my reply to Prof. 
McGregor, I do not think that the Addendum is worthy of publication. 
Since one part of the Addendum deals with issues related to the RAOBCORE 
data used by DCPS07 (and by us), Leo responded to Prof. McGregor on this 
point. I will forward Leo's response in a separate email.
The Addendum does not reference our IJoC paper. As far as I can tell, 
the Addendum represents a response to discussions of the original IJoC 
paper on RealClimate.org. Curiously, Douglass et al. do not give a 
specific source for the criticism of their original paper. This is 
rather bizarre. Crucially, the Addendum does not recognize or admit ANY 
ERRORS in the original DCPS07 paper.
I have not yet heard whether IJoC intends to publish the Addendum. I'll 
update you as soon as I have any further information from Prof. McGregor.
With best regards,
Ben
