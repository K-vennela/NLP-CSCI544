Hi Leah,
I’m waiting to hear back from Bain re setting up a meeting with them on what they are looking for re e-Discovery.  Our current database do not separately keep track of e-Discovery spend and how many cases are used annually.  
How would you like me to proceed?  Should I reach out to Len for assistance on this info or inform Bain that we don’t have this info readily available?
