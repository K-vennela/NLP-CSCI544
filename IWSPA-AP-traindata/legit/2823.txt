Good Tuesday morning, Illinois. There's finally a reprieve of sorts with Chicago crime numbers in April. There was one more murder this April than in 2015 but the skyrocketing murder surge we saw in January and February has considerably slowed. 
In Springfield, lawmakers are back today and working groups we told you about on Monday are still hashing out budget negotiations. Gov. Bruce Rauner on Monday said he backed the rank-and-file talks and hoped for a "grand bargain" but wouldn't say what kinds of reforms, if any, had to be part of it. More on all of that below. 
Finally, Monday night, a familiar restaurant was singled out in the prestigious James Beard awards, held in Chicago. Let's start there: 
ALINEA SNAGS BEST RESTAURANT HONOR -- "Los Angeles Chef, Chicago's Alinea Win Big at Beard Awards," ABC News: "Chef Suzanne Goin took home the outstanding chef award Monday night at the James Beard Awards, and Chicago mainstay Alinea won the outstanding restaurant honor at a ceremony many consider the Academy Awards of the culinary world. It's the first outstanding restaurant win for Alinea. Its chef, Grant Achatz, won the outstanding chef award in 2008 and has earned other honors from the Beard Foundation over the years but never the top prize. Achatz's ultramodern cooking style has come to define the molecular gastronomy movement. He thanked his staff during the awards Monday night at
Chicago's Lyric Opera for trusting him, having courage and 'taking the risk to innovate.'" <<link>> 
THE REASON YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THERE -- The cost of dinner for two at Alinea is $702. But! That includes gratuity. <<link>> 
RISE IN CITY MURDERS SLOWS -- "Chicago's soaring murder count slows in April," by Chicago Sun-Times' Mitch Dudek: "Homicides in April increased only 3 percent compared with April of last year, an anything-but-perfect but still welcome stat considering the sharp uptick in murders recorded in the first three months of 2016, including a 126 percent jump in February. There were 36 murders this April, one more murder than in April 2015, the Chicago Police Department said Sunday. Homicides ballooned in January and have tapered since. The progress was highlighted by the police department, but this year's murder stats still outpace last year's numbers." <<link>>
FIRST LOOK: Airbnb isn't happy with Mayor Emanuel's proposal to add a surcharge onto its rentals to help the homeless, so it went into the field and asked 700 registered Chicago voters about it. The results shows people overwhelmingly supported Airbnb, a home vacation rental business, and wanted an even playing field between the Airbnb and hotels. A summary of the poll provided to POLITICO shows: "voters do not want a tax hike on Airbnb homeshares. Voters overwhelmingly oppose taxing Airbnb rooms at a higher rate than hotel rooms, making Airbnb guests pay an additional 2% surcharge (15% support / 76% oppose)." We were only provided a summary, however, so it's tough to really evaluate the
results without knowing which questions were asked and how they were asked. 
Neighborhood strength: The polling summary does make clear the business strategy, which is similar to Uber: pit the stodgy old industry against innovation. While Uber launched an ad campaign focusing on its service in the city's neighborhoods, Airbnb seems to be focusing there too, arguing it lets homeowners in neighborhoods make an extra buck instead of just the wealthy hotel owners downtown.

RAHM TO STATE: F is YOU -- "Emanuel: Focus on State Lawmakers for Education Funding," by WLS News' Bill Cameron: "The Chicago Teachers Union is 'leaning against' going on strike later this month, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel is glad to hear it. Emanuel says he welcomes talk of no strike because he says we should instead be talking about finishing the year and building on the success of teachers and students. 'And let's as leaders use our time to convince the State of Illinois to stop [getting] an 'F' when it comes to funding education and not allow them to get another 'F' this year when it comes to funding education for poor kids,' Emanuel said." <<link>>

DISPARAGING DOOBIES -- "Medical marijuana board rips Rauner's rejections," by Chicago Tribune's Celeste Bott: "Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner came under fire Monday as the doctors, nurses and patients on a state panel that recommends whether to expand Illinois' medical marijuana test program complained their suggestions are routinely ignored. The Medical Marijuana Advisory Board suggested that 10 previously recommended ailments receive approval, as well two new ones: Type 1 diabetes and panic disorder. As some at a hearing celebrated the diabetes recommendation, board member and pediatrician Dr. Nestor Ramirez cautioned the crowd to 'wait for what the governor says.'"

TRUMP SCORES WITH HELP OF CHICAGO INSIDERS-- "WATCHDOGS: The Donald & the Democrat; Burke saved Trump $11.7M," by Chicago Sun-Times' Tim Novak and Chris Fusco: "A law firm headed by Ald. Edward M. Burke, one of Chicago's most powerful Democrats, has helped Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and investors in his luxury downtown hotel cut their property taxes by 39 percent over seven years, saving them $11.7 million, a Chicago Sun-Times analysis has found. Burke - one of 47 Chicago aldermen who voted to approve development of Trump International Hotel & Tower in 2002 - won reductions in six of the seven years for the hotel, retail and other commercial space in the skyscraper,
records show." <<link>> 
WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, GET OUT OF THE WAY -- "As Rauner Hunts For A Grand Bargain, He's Leaving The Actual Bargaining To Others," by WUIS' Amanda Vinicky: "As the state budget impasse has entered an eleventh month, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner says he's hopeful a 'grand bargain' can be worked out by the end of May; but he's leaving the bargaining to others ... Rauner says he's not directly involved in talks. But he's the governor. When asked whether he should be, Rauner answered: 'At various points in the past I have been ... and I don't think the leaders in the legislature are directly involved either ... This is a grass roots effort from members of the General Assembly. And it's just the
right thing. I think they're taking the bull by the horns." <<link>> 
FOX: "The Governor says he's confident that there could be a deal by the end of session.But he avoided questions Monday on what reforms he needs to have as part of a grand bargain or how high he'd be willing to raise taxes." <<link>> 
WHO FOLLOWS CHIEF ILLINIWEK? -- "Chancellor OKs mascot search," by The News Gazette's Julie Wurth: "Nine years after the retirement of Chief Illiniwek, the University of Illinois is launching a process to choose a 'first-ever' athletic mascot. Interim Chancellor Barbara Wilson announced her decision at the campus Academic Senate meeting on Monday. Wilson endorsed the recommendation from an Illinois Student Senate ad hoc committee that recently urged the campus to move forward with a mascot. She met with the group on Friday." <<link>> 
STRIKE-ENDING DEAL AT U OF I -- "Update: Strike ends, Non-Tenure Faculty Coalition, University administration reach tentative contract agreement," by Daily Illini's Megan Jones and Vivienne Henning: "Classes will resume as normal for the final three days of classes this semester. The Non-Tenure Faculty Coalition Local 6546 voted Sunday evening to end the strike and return to work as normal. University administration and the NTFC released a joint statement Saturday evening, stating a tentative five-year contract was agreed upon. This is the first contract for the union after three rounds of labor actions and the union will hold a vote to ratify and accept the contract on Thursday, May 5."

HASTERT NOW FAMOUS FOR SOMETHING ELSE -- "National Wrestling Hall of Fame revokes Hastert's awards," by The Associated Press: "The National Wrestling Hall of Fame said Monday that it has revoked all honors for Dennis Hastert after the former House speaker was accused of sexually abusing teenagers decades ago. The Oklahoma-based organization said its Board of Governors approved the revocation after its ethics committee found that Hastert's actions were 'detrimental to the ideals and objectives' of the Wrestling Hall of Fame. Executive Director Lee Roy Smith said the organization decided to wait for the outcome of Hastert's criminal case before taking any action. 'In the 40 years since it was
founded, the National Wrestling Hall of Fame has never had to remove an individual who had received one of its highest awards,' Smith said in a statement Monday." <<link>> 
SIU ANGER OVER RACIST VIDEO -- "Protests target racism, debt at Southern Illinois University," by The Associated Press: "Several hundred Southern Illinois University protesters have rallied against student debt and racism following recent incidents including an anonymous video calling for violence against black students. The Monday march in Carbondale was conceived as a one-day strike to call attention to economic issues. The protest broadened after the video's online release via YouTube drew condemnation from university leaders one week ago. YouTube later removed it for violating the company's policies on hate speech. University and Carbondale police reported no arrests by Monday afternoon
as participants chanted in a courtyard in the center of campus." <<link>> 
FREE TO PROTEST, JUST DON'T BE SEEN OR HEARD-- "Screens blocking I-355 protesters prompt free-speech debate," by Daily Herald's Marni Pyke: "One of the true signs of spring is the budding of protesters on the Great Western Trail overpass on I-355 and traffic jams when drivers slow down to gape. But this year it's different. Dark screening now partially obscures the view of 'Impeach Obama' signs waved by demonstrators. Some resourceful activists rigged up sign extensions that jutted out above the screening last week when I drove by. But it wasn't quite the same. If there were any fist-pumping or thumbs-up gestures, they were hard to see at 40 mph."

FORCING TAKEOVER TALKS AT TRIB -- "Gannett tells Tribune shareholders not to vote for board," by The Associated Press: "Gannett is escalating its pursuit of buy rival newspaper company Tribune, telling shareholders of Tribune not to vote for board members up for election in June. Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, said Monday that withholding a vote at Tribune's annual meeting next month will send a message to the management team that it needs to engage in takeover talks. A representative for Tribune did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday morning." <<link>> 
TRIB EDIT BOARD'S REQUEST FOR BILL BRADY -- "The Illinois GOP senator holding the cards," Chicago Tribune Editorial board: <<link>> 
LEGAL AID CLINICS TAKE A HIT -- "Feeling the pinch," by Chicago Daily Law Bulletin's David Thomas: "Legal aid clinics have, for the most part, managed to stay afloat as other social services begin to sink after nearly a full year without a state budget. Directors at these clinics have acknowledged a perverse fact about their continued survival: Because they were getting so little money in the first place, losing out on that money from the state wasn't going to automatically shut down their clinics. But the cracks are starting to show for some legal aid clinics, and some indicated they will have to either lay off workers or cut back on services if their funding situation doesn't improve." 
<<link>> 
RAHM PRETENDS STRIKE ALREADY AVERTED -- "Emanuel pleased CTU strike unlikely this school year," by Chicago Sun-Times' Fran Spielman and Lauren FitzPatrick: "Although the Chicago Teachers Union has not yet made it official, Mayor Rahm Emanuel acted as if it was a fait accompli that the threat of Chicago's second teachers strike in four years had been lifted - at least until fall. 'The good news is, they agreed not to strike.' ... the mayor said Monday. Sharkey, the CTU's vice president, told the Sun-Times that teachers are leaning away from going out on strike later this month, when the law first allows them. The House of Delegates, the union's body authorized to set a strike date, will meet
Wednesday to discuss possible plans, but Sharkey and other CTU members have said that union members worry about losing health insurance and their last paychecks of the year before summer." <<link>> 
MAYOR OFFERS ZOPP NEW HOME -- "Sneed exclusive: Emanuel picks Zopp to be a deputy mayor," by Chicago Sun-Times' Michael Sneed: "Mayor Rahm Emanuel has offered a slice of the power pie to former Urban League powerhouse Andrea Zopp, a highly respected Chicago attorney who lost her Democratic primary bid for the U.S. Senate to Tammy Duckworth. Sneed has learned Emanuel asked Zopp, who has strong ties to Chicago's African-American political and fiscal power players, to become Chicago's deputy mayor in charge of overseeing major city projects." <<link>> 
'BOLD BET' IN WEST LOOP -- "Another office tower to rise in West Loop," by Crain's Ryan Ori: "A group of local developers is breaking ground on a 20-story office building in the West Loop without securing any tenants in advance, a bold bet on the continued strength of the downtown office market. A venture that includes Rosemont-based White Oak Realty Partners and Chicago-based CA Ventures said by June it will start constructing the 432,000-square-foot tower next to Old St. Patrick's Church. Unlike other developers that lease some of a building's space in advance, the venture is developing the tower on speculation, or 'spec,' confident that tenants will come after construction is underway." 
<<link>> 
BUYING TIME ON LUCAS -- "City requests delay in Lucas Museum court case," Chicago Tribune: "The city of Chicago and the Chicago Park District filed a motion Monday requesting a 30-day stay in the court proceedings related to the original Lucas Museum proposal south of Soldier Field, saying the delay will allow time for continued exploration of the alternate McCormick Place site. Friends of the Parks, the preservation group which filed a lawsuit to block the museum on the lakefront, agreed to the delay. A judge will consider the request next week." <<link>> 
CITY COUNCIL RUNS THE METER -- "Aldermen winning in taxi war with ride-booking companies," by Crain's Greg Hinz: "The renewed City Council fight over whether to require ride-booking companies like Uber and Lyft to use only drivers with a chauffeur's license is sparking a campaign cash windfall for Chicago aldermen and some of their pet causes. Most obvious is the giving by the Illinois Transportation Trade Association PAC, which represents traditional taxi companies, but both sides are opening their wallets. Since a measure by Ald. Anthony Beale, 9th, and other members of the City Council's progressive caucus to require such a license, was introduced last month, ITTA has donated at least
$23,000 to a total of 18 aldermen. Most got $1,000 each, but Beale received $5,000." <<link>> 
ENGLEWOOD'S SHOT AT THE WHITE HOUSE -- "Englewood Chess Champs Could Meet President Obama," by DNAinfo's Andrea V. Watson: "The Earle STEM Academy all-girls chess team took home a national championship trophy - and its members might get to meet President Barack Obama. A recent win at the All-Girls National Chess Tournament in Chicago last month could earn the five students the opportunity to shake hands with the president. The team saw its budget slashed as Chicago Public Schools cut budgets around the district earlier this year." <<link>> 
OR YOU COULD JUST ASK FOR LESS ICE -- "Lawsuit: Starbucks iced coffee contains too much ice, not enough coffee," by Washington Post's Sarah Larimer: "Just how important is the ice in an iced coffee? That question is now up for debate, as an Illinois woman has filed suit against Starbucks, claiming that the coffee chain is 'underfilling' its cold beverages, duping customers and serving drinks that contain less coffee than advertised. 'Starbucks is misleading customers who expect to receive the advertised amount of fluid ounces,' states the class-action lawsuit, which was filed last week in federal court." <<link>> 
MARK KIRK'S AMONG THEM -- "Trump Could Be A Real Drag On GOP: Here Are The Top 10 Senate Races To Watch," by WBEZ's Jessica Taylor: "Aside from the White House race, there's another important battle this November that shouldn't be overlooked - the fight for control of the U.S. Senate. Republicans won back the majority just two years ago after eight years in the political wilderness. But they could just as easily lose that new-found power, especially if a controversial GOP nominee like Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket. Republicans believe that likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton could also damage some Democrats, though, with low approval ratings herself and the shadow of her
email scandal still lingering." <<link>> 
THAT COULD BUY A LOT OF LEGROOM -- "Ex-United CEO got $36.8 million severance package," by Chicago Tribune's Becky Yerak: "A former United Continental Holdings chief executive who left the airline last September amid an investigation into an alleged corruption scandal received a severance package totaling $36.8 million ... When Jeff Smisek, former United chairman, CEO and president, resigned in September, it was estimated he would depart with a golden parachute of at least $8.4 million and possibly double that amount. His pay package included $94,571 for unused vacation." <<link>> 
FOODIE FODDER -- "Inside Rick Bayless' Cruz Blanca, Opening Thursday On Randolph," by DNAinfo's Stephanie Lulay: "It's almost taco time. Chef Rick Bayless' two neighboring Randolph Street concepts - craft brewery and taquer&iacute;a Cruz Blanca Cervecer&iacute;a, and Baja-inspired seafood restaurant Le&ntilde;a Brava - will open on Thursday, just in time for Cinco de Mayo. Cruz Blanca, at 904 W. Randolph St., will not take reservations, as the taco and beer counters are both walk-up, but Le&ntilde;a Brava is now taking reservations online. Inspired by Emil Dercher, the brewer who left France and made his way to Mexico City, where he sold beers under the Cruz Blanca label."
