Okay, let=E2=80=99s take a step back.
No one is critiquing your boy or being mean.  He has =E2=80=9Coverstepped=E2=
=80=9D his boundaries with Joe and Bobby and I am trying to bring him =
back from the brink.  He has, unbeknownst to us, emailed Joe and Bobby =
weekly asking to come and see POTUS.  Explain about his cancer.  They =
sent him a note, they are and going to see him tomorrow; they feel like =
he is putting the President in a weird spot since a lot of people =
unfortunately get sick.=20
Phil Munger is one of the largest democratic donors in the country.  He =
is looking to give his money in new places and I would like that to be =
to us.=20
So, once Phil confirms, please move him next to the President and =
Sreedhar across the way.  If you still find this objectionable, maybe =
you can move Munger next to POTUS; move Agnes to where Phil is and =
Sreedhar where Agnes is.
Thanks -=20
