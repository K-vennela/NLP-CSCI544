Thanks for the Benestad reference, which I hadn't seen and will read 
with interest.
Please keep me in the loop on your reprints.
I'm aware of the work with Dave Thompson, which is very interesting.
Happy new year to you too.
We can all look back on 2007 as a year in which we, the scientists, 
did a fantastic job.
best
Susan
