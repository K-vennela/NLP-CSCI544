FCC to Fine AT&T $100 Million for Capping Unlimited Data Plans The Federal Communications Commission plans to fine AT&T $100 million for allegedly deceiving consumers about unlimited wireless data plans, the agency said Wednesday. The FCC alleges that AT&T sold consumers data plans advertised as unlimited, then capped data speeds for those customers after they used a set amount of data within a billing cycle. The FCC says those capped speeds were much slower than the normal network speeds advertised by AT&T, and that they impaired consumers' ability to access the Internet or use applications for the rest of their billing cycle.
