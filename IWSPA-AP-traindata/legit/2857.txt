Hello Crew,
We're going off TeenScreen for just one assignment but
we'll be back.
The subject of this one is Scientology.
Write a letter to the editor and send it to
user@domain.com
You're not responding to any particular article but
there have been some unsavory letters lately.
Start your letter with something like:
-I thought I'd set the record straight on
Scientology...
-Let me tell you my experience with Scientology...
-There is a lot of false information about Scientology
being spread by people who don't know firsthand. Let
me tell you how it is...
-Your letter writers got it wrong. Scientology is...
And then tell your experience with Scientology, some
win or a general opinion about it.
It should be a true story about how much Scientology
has helped you, especially the wins you have had in
helping others.
Examples:
("I was amazed and happy to find that the assist
technology helped this woman walk so much
better....or, I never thought I could be happy and
now...or, I was happy to hear my daughter say that she
would never
take drugs because she pledged to be a 'Drug-Free
Marshal'....or, I always thought I couldn't learn and
then learned the Study Technology and now...or, I've
been noticing lately that more and more people want
to know about Scientology as they have been hearing
such positive things about our community betterment
programs and how we are helping in the community...or,
I'm really glad my daughter is happy again after
she learned about the Study Technology that L. Ron
Hubbard devised to help others learn...)
The paper requests 200 words or less. If you just have
to go over that, go ahead but it will probably hurt
your chances of getting published.
Include your name, address, daytime and evening phone
numbers.
And report compliance by email.
Thank you!
Doyle
