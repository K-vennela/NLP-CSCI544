Hi Keith and Tim - Eystein and I just talked about Henry's request to 
be able to read and comment on your SOD text, and it seems highly 
appropriate that we work super hard to make this possible. It is 
taking place w/ other sections of the SOD, and your section is the 
one that has to be the most perfect.
I'm guessing that we'll have final figs this week or over the weekend 
(please!), and the edited section a day or two later (at the most). 
As per the last email to you and Henry, you can save everyone time if 
you send sections relevant to him (all the multi-proxy and proxy 
sections) as soon as they are done.
Sorry to keep the pressure on, but we are running out of time.
thanks, peck
