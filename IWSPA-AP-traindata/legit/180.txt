I hope all of you know what the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is. If
not, go to www.cchr.org, search for the term and get
hatted.

It has an interesting perspective on the DSM.
The DSM is the perfect target for attack. It is the
stable datum of all psychiatry as practiced today. If
we discredit and eventually eliminate the DSM,
psychiatry itself is on very shaky ground.
A very good article was published this week in the
Baltimore Sun. See link and text below.
Write a powerful letter to the editor and send it to
user@domain.com
Applaud them for getting out the truth. Or just use
the opportunity to make some true statements about how
psychiatry is not scientific, not a branch of
medicine, or about how their disorders are fraudulent.
If your last name begins with C or P, mention Tom
Cruise, in passing. Don't make your letter about
Cruise but throw in a phrase like "just like Tom
Cruise said" or a sentence like "Tom Cruise is right".
It's very good that articles like this are telling the
truth. It's unheard of. We should celebrate and
contribute to the motion!
Once you've written and sent your letter, report
compliance by email.
Thank you!
