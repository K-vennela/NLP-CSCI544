Tom,
Agreed that NCDC must have some data gaps - but this isn't very clear from the web
site.
GISS is inferior - not just because it doesn't use back data. They also impose some
urbanization adjustment which is based on population/night lights which I don't think is
very good. Their gridding also smooths things out. Plotting all three together for land
only though they look similar at decadal timescales. GISS does have less year-to-year
variability - when I last looked.
I assume NCDC should add the back data in - although there isn't the need if infilling
is going on OK.
I've never looked to see if NCDC changes from year to year.
I think you can say that GISS is inferior to CRUTEM3.  In Ch 3 of AR4 I put the station
number counts in.
GISS and NCDC have more, but almost all of this is more data in the US. Their non-use of a
base period (GISS using something very odd and NCDC first differences) means they can use
very short series that we can't (as they don't have base periods) but with short series it
is impossible to assess for homogeneity. So some of their extra series may be very short
ones as well. As you know the more important thing is where the stations are (and in time).
The paper I sent you by Adrian Simmons shows great agreement with CRUTEM3 when
subsampled according to CRU grid boxes. Also shows that ERA-INTERIM is very good.
ERA-INTERIM's absolute is also within 0.2 deg C of the CRU 14 deg C value. It would give
about 13.8 for 1961-90. Sometime I should write this up as more and more people seem to be
using 15 deg C.
Away from tomorrow till next Tuesday.
Cheers
Phil
