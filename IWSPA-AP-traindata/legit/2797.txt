The Foundation of Contract Drafting:=20
The Devil Is in the Details
The basics of drafting a well-crafted contract...including essential compon=
ents,=20
provisions and proper safeguards to protect your institution's interests.
At the outset of any relationship, everyone tends to be filled with enthusi=
asm. The prospects for profits, the anticipation of progress, and the excit=
ement of a new entrepreneurial enterprise may tempt the parties to give sho=
rt shrift to the details of their contract. They can't wait to get their jo=
int activities underway. But experienced professionals know that a well-dra=
fted contract can serve to define the parties' relationship in order to avo=
id conflicts down the road and as the vehicle for conflict resolution when =
things go south. Ambiguities, omissions and inconsistencies can doom the re=
lationship and complicate any subsequent conflicts.
This webinar will examine the basics of contract drafting, including:
The essential components of almost any commercial contract, whether employm=
ent, sales, services, or real estate.
Boilerplate: what's essential, what's only nice, and what is simply "bloat."
Dispute resolution: the pros and cons of all the options.
Term and termination provisions.
Warranties, waivers, indemnities and insurance coverages.
AND MUCH MORE!
Please join Dr. Jim Castagnera, Esq. as he covers the core principles that =
should appear in any well-drafted contract to help ensure that the parties'=
relationship on paper is well-defined and includes the proper safeguards t=
o protect your institution's interests.
