Bill,
I think you have some misinformation, you are a valued part of the NSM, and
we did not ask you to serve in the SS because we think badly of you, and I
certainly would not be sending you important staff mail (potential new
recruits) if I did not trust you.
What is your phone #, I don't seem to have it in my phone for some reason?
Your status in the Party is secure. Call me if you like at 320-583-2380, and
perhaps I need to address the person who is spreading the disinformation as
well. WE ARE A FAMILY, and this matter can be resolved. 88
