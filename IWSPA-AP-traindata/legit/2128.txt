Hey Sri,
After deliberating with our hosts, we think it best to push back to June.  We do not want to infringe on Tina (or Neera's) holiday weekend, so would like to look at dates in June, if that works for Tina.
In an effort to align both Neera and Tina's schedules, we requested Neera's June availability, which is below:
Monday, June 6
Tuesday, June 7
Monday, June 27
Tuesday, June 28
Wednesday, June 29
Please let us know if any of the above are options and we can move this forward.  Thanks again for your assistance on all of this.  We know it has been a fete trying to get this scheduled!
