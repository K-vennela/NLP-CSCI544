Chief Director:
Can you investigate whether we might be able to jam five people into the
White House on either Tuesday, May 17 or Thursday, May 19 for a tour?
This is for Chet Atkins who is one of our donors in MA and who raises
checks as well.
Let me know if this is a possibility and we'll break the good (or bad) news
to them.
Thanks!
