Kevin - ah yes, good fun. Talked w/ Susan about some of this, and we're hoping that Keith
Briffa might be able to participate in "Cluster B" while the rest of our chap 6 team
discusses things that bore Keith. I'll forward this to relevant chap 6 folks. Thx, Peck
Jon
FYI wrt Beijing and overlap issues with chapter 6.  You may find some exchanges of
interest as well.
