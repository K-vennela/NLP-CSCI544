SS Probate Herring,
NS  greetings, it is good to hear from you and glad to hear all is going
well  with you and the Family. Quitting cigs and booze is a big undertaking,
that is hardcore.
Its going well here in Detroit, culture shock with all the nigs, but other
than that it is great.
Cute baby pics, nice  to see the little Skinhead happy and healthy. Stay
strong Brother, see you in April. 88
