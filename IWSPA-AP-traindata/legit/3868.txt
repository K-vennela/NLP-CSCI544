Mike, Gavin,
Here are a few important mods to your piece. Don't mention Keith has been off ill.
Remove the bit about provenance and about access to more data. We'll go into the latter in
the longer bit next week.
We'll send the piece we're putting up later - or give you the link.
Rest of your piece is great - especially the bit on how science should be done. Keith has
also picked up in the bit we'll post that McIntyre has put in the caveats but lets others
say the outrageous things in comments or on other blogs.
Cheers
Phil
