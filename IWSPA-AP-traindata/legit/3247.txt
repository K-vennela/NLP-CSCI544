Dear Steven, Would prefer to keep them where they are as all those concurrent with the existing US date have good holidays to take advantage of and those that are later are there for Halloween/All Saints. A couple have Jungle Book against them but I think we are stronger. The one that might benefit from 9/18 is Romania which did huge business last time around. That is the back to school week which is traditionally very good and kids get out early from classes most of the weekdays. Current date 10/23 leads nicely in to Halloween as we did last time but if we did move up that would also be a great date for Goosebumps. Thanks,Mark From: ODell, Steven 
Let me know if you think your markets would want to move up if the US advances one week.  Ok to reach out to the key territories in confidence
