SS Herring,
Perhaps get a phone # from this guy, and pass it on to McBride here in MI.
we need to rebuild the ranks here in MI. I have a solid handful of people
here, but could use some new troops to fire things back up here in MI. I
have no time for local organizing, just like when I was in MN. I was focused
on the National scene and the locals took care of the local work. 88
