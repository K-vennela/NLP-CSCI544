Hi Keith,
for your information, I  have enclosed the letter 
received on the outcome of phase 1, and the 
guidance for Stage 2. We will dig up more.
I also talked with Christoph Heinze who said this 
definately  has the flair of someone in the 
review panel having an agenda of revenge, and 
that this could be an element of a formal 
complaint.
More later,
Eystein
