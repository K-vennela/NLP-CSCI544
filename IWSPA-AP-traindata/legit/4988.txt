How to Easily Create Charts that are 'Off the Chart'
Successful business people know that to communicate
effectively, you need visuals. Studies have shown that
communicating with visuals is up to six times more
effective than using words alone.
But if you've struggled to come up with effective
presentation visuals using Excel® charts, you aren't
alone.
Excel offers several types of charts and graphs with
some customization features. The problem is, unless
you're a "power" Excel user, their charts can be
difficult and frustrating to use. 
Even if you are a wizard with Excel charts, there is 
only so much you can do with them. Excel is an excellent
spreadsheet program but as far as visual presentation,
well, let's just say it's an excellent spreadsheet program.
"I'm sorry, I can't help you. Trying to figure out Excel charts is what drove me up here to begin with."

Charts that are Quick, Easy, and Intuitive 
SmartDraw, on the other hand, is designed for creating 
great visuals. It does most of the work for you, automatically. Unlike Excel, which requires the average person
to spend a lot of time hunting through tool bars, drop down
menus, and so forth, SmartDraw offers options that are easy
and intuitive. Most of your work can be done directly on
the chart itself.
Let's look at a very simple Excel data table and use it
to create a basic line chart using both Excel and SmartDraw.
In Excel, we have to click the graphs tab from our
spreadsheet, which opens a default graph on the screen.
After serveral clicks, and probably a few searches on
the "Help" tab, we have defined data from the table above,
our Excel chart looks like this.
This chart is a mess and, frankly, the task of
completing it can be daunting if you aren't experienced
using the charting features in Excel. Clearly, there's
going to be a lot of work needed to clean this up and
make it presentable. 
Okay, let's bring in the same Excel data table using 
SmartDraw. We begin by selecting a line chart template
and clicking on the "Import from Excel" button on the
SmartPanel. SmartDraw asks us to select the data we
want to use from our table. Next, we click on one of
the standard chart formats and SmartDraw gives us
this as a starting point.
What a difference! This chart is almost presentation
ready right now. In fact, you can click on the data
labels, type in the title and information you want,
and have a very basic chart that's ready to go in
seconds.
Now let's go back over to the clean-up job on our
Excel chart. After several more points, clicks and
a considerable amount of jumping between toolbars,
we have a chart that looks like this.
One of the first things you'll notice about the above
chart is that the X-axis labels lie below the "zero"
line on the vertical axis. Because we have some
negative numbers, those labels run right through
the data on the chart. This is the default setting
in Excel, and while it can be corrected, the fix isn't
at all intuitive. (In fact, if you haven't done it
before, you'll probably need to do a web search to find the
answer, which is what we had to do - and, well... good 
luck with that!) If your data includes negative numbers,
this can be a frustrating situation. Chances are you've
probably seen a PowerPoint® presentation with a chart 
that looked like this ugly thing.
Let's go back to our SmartDraw chart. Unlike Excel,
SmartDraw actually lets us point, click and edit
virtually any of our changes right on the chart.
With a few clicks, you can see that we've added a
title, some labels and a splash of color to our
SmartDraw chart below. This chart was actually
created in less time than the Excel chart above.
Which of these two charts would you rather use at
your meeting or presentation?
You could certainly stop at this point and have a very
nice-looking chart to present. But let's go just a bit
further and add a picture to the background to really
give this visual some pizzazz. There's really no
reason to just inform our audience when we can also
entertain and impress them, as well.
In just a couple of minutes, you can make your SmartDraw
chart look like this. Compare this chart to the ones
you're used to seeing in meetings and presentations.
This is just one example, created easily, with no
training or special skills using SmartDraw. 
Because SmartDraw is a visual processor, it allows
you to take your charts into new and exciting
dimensions that just aren't available to you in Excel.
But because SmartDraw works seamlessly with the entire
suite of Office® products, you can use your SmartDraw
charts in Word® documents or PowerPoint presentations
with a single click.
