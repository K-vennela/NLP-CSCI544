Hi Ed - thanks for trying to fit something in quick for the NRC group. I'm not sure about
Richard's full motives, but I think he has his heart in the right place - that the NRC
Committee might have gotten the impression he did, and this will be reflected in their
report, perhaps in a way that is even less satisfactory to you and Keith. And, this report
will likely have enormous political potential. It needs to get things as right as possible
from the start. So... time well spent on the part of you and Keith. Thanks much, peck
Hi Peck,
Being in Bangkok, on to PACLIM, on to CONCORD in Mendoza, back to Bangkok, and back to
NY on May 1 makes it difficult for me to do much, but I will do what I can to salvage a
bad situation. The longish emails I sent out to you all contain much of what I would
write. The main point to make, one that Richard seems to be totally oblivious to, is
that there is no evidence for loss of sensitivity prior to the 20th century in a
large-scale NH sense like that seen in the 20th century. On the other hand, there is
evidence that there was not a loss of sensitivity in a large-scale NH sense in my QSR
paper (Fig. 6). I acknowledge the weakness in the data prior to about 1200, but even so
the regional comparisons only show divergence between north and south in the 20th
century, with none indicated during the putative MWP. So why is Richard and the NRC
panel apparently stating without evidence that divergence probably is a problem in the
past and, therefore, tree rings cannot be trusted to reconstruct past temperatures? It
is honestly unscientific when the only evidence that I have seen refutes that premise,
and it plays unfairly into McIntyre's hand. I almost admit to being very irritated that
Richard should anoint himself as the arbitrator of this debate. He knows nothing
substantive about tree rings. In that sense, he is just like Ray Bradley.
Cheers,
Ed
