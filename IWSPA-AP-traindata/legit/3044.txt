Oh MAN! will this crap ever end??
Well, I will have to properly answer in a couple days when I get a chance digging through
emails. I don't recall from the top of my head any specifics about IPCC.
I'm also sorry that you guys have to go through this BS. You all did an outstanding job and
the IPCC report certainly reflects that science and literature in an accurate and balanced
way.
So long,
Caspar
