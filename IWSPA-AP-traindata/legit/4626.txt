Hopefully no offense was taken on your part by anything you read of mine ei=
ther in my last email or on my web page.  If so=2C I apologize.  If you hav=
e yet to even have read my previous response to you then I will apologize a=
head of time.  My views on religion stem from the National Socialist viewpo=
int that it DOES NOT belong in the political spectrum.  I have much respect=
for Aryans of all religious backgrounds but I would never raise my childre=
n (if/when I have any) with any sort of religious bias as I believe faith i=
s an adult decision. =20

vement with the ferver and respect I have for our race and country!  Any re=
sponse from you is welcomed and I hope you are well. =20
