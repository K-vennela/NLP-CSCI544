Dear  Tim, dear Keith,
I am writing to inform you that I have reconsidered my acceptance to attend 
the Wengen meeting. In the last days I have  convinced myself  that under the present circumstances
a constructive discussion on reconstruction methods is unfortunately not  possible. 
We have another exchange on the last Journal of Climate paper by Mann et al, which is now under review. Even the editor of J. of Climate found adequate to tell us that all inflammatory comments in their response would have to be eventually deleted.   
Even considering the considerable pressure that he has is
exposed to in American politics, I think Michael Mann is unable of any constructive discussion.  
I am very grateful for your invitation to this meeting and I hope that we can continue our collaboration in other ocasion. 
Best wishes
eduardo
