Hi Keith and yvind - I agree, this is great, and 
your priorities are on target. I'll prepare to 
help on those non-temp subsections after you take 
a look at the (especially the North Atlantic/NAO 
one - which is closer to your strength than mine, 
I suspect).
As for captions, they're in the Figs/Captions 
Worddoc that yvind sent on the 24th.
Thanks to yvind for doing the references job as suggested by Keith.
Best, peck
