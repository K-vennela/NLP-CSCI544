thanks Phil,
I wondered where this completely false claim was coming with. Are these people really so
clueless that they don't even understand that I have nothing to do with this whatsoever.
Pretty much tells you everything you need to do.
I never acknowledge emails from people I don't know, about topics that are in any way
sensitive. this is a perfect example of something that goes right to the trash bin,
mike
