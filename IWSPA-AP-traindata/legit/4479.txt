Well done Judy!
I hope you take note that not one  not even one
comment posted is positive for TeenScreen. TeenScreen
is dangerous; it gets our teens put on psychiatric
drugs that cause suicide and other erratic, harmful
behaviors; and it is nothing more than a public
relations ploy to fatten the coffers of the drug
companies and their main representatives, the
psychiatrists. Parents, beware. If your child is
exhibiting any behavior that is not normal for him,
contact a natural medical doctor and get his hormonal
balance and amino acid levels checked. This planet,
thankfully, provides a natural remedy for every
possible affliction if we take the time to find it.
