State Parties--
With our 2016 T3 "Train the Trainer" Program in the books, we are excited for the hundreds of activists and county leaders that we've equipped to train new volunteers ahead of this year's elections. T3 participants received 6 weeks of extensive training in local organizing, party messaging, technology, and more. With newly skilled trainers in your state, we hope that you've thought about ways to incorporate them into your training efforts as we gear up for historic elections in November.
Join us for this week's Train to Win webinar, T3 Program for State Parties: Next Steps (<<link>>) . We'll discuss learning objectives from our 2016 T3 series and next steps for engaging T3-certified participants in the states. Please register using the link below.
Thursday, May 26- <<link>>
We look forward to speaking with you this Thursday.
