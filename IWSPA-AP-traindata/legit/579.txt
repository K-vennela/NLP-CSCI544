Resending. Apologies! I changed Jean's email incorrectly. This one is now correct.

David,
I will send you this once we post the ZOD on the WG1 web site in mid-Jan05. Our diagrams
are in a state of flux. Most of the temperature and precipitation trend maps are being
done
in Asheville and I should be getting them later this week or early next. We will be
showing maps
for the whole 20th century, but others will focus on the period since 1979. You might like
to
consider avoiding duplication by using these - eventually they will be 1979-2005 (poss
2006).
Trends of indices in extremes will likely be similar, but with +/- signs on maps. Nothing
has
been decided yet, though, and I expect a significant part of our time at LA2 will be taken
up
by discussing/improving diagrams in our ZOD.
You can help us by sending comments to WG1 on the relevant parts - which are likely
to be almost all.
Cheers
Phil
Cheers
Phil
