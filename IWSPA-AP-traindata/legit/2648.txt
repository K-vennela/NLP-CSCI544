<x-flowed>Dear Ray
You sent me this op-ed (?) (Letter to editor?) about the need to convert 
the US from a carbon-based economy to a hydrogen-based economy.  I can't 
guess why you wanted me to know your views, but it does help me to better 
understand what motivates your scientific work and judgment.  It also 
throws some doubt about your impartiality in promoting the "hockey stick' 
temperature curve that a number of us have been critical of.
In any case, I doubt if espousal of this energy policy will help BP and 
ARCO discover a source of hydrogen somewhere.
You quote the "progressive" Business Council approvingly: "We accept the 
views of most scientists that enough is known about the science and 
environmental impacts of climate change for us to take actions to address 
its consequences."  And from BP chairman : "the time to consider the policy 
dimensions of policy change is not when the link between greenhouse gases 
and climate change is conclusively proven, but when the possibility cannot 
be discounted and is taken seriously by the society of which we are part."
I note that BP and ARCO are still out there exploring for oil; they don't 
seem to be quite ready yet to put real money where their mouth is.
You call  for the US to take leadership in stabilizing the 
climate.  Perhaps the government will turn to you to learn how to do 
this.  A far less ambitious goal would be to stabilize the atmospheric 
concentration of CO2.  According to the IPCC this would require an emission 
reduction  of 60 to 80 percent (with respect to 1990) --- WORLDWIDE.
Have you ever considered the consequences of such a policy -- assuming it 
could really be adopted?
Best wishes ,
Fred
