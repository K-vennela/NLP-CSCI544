Ben,
Good news. Endnote types is a much better option
than in the text - not as good as footnotes.
Yes the paper you attached does look crap. I will read it though
even if the journal is even worse.
This paper has come out.  The plot of London and Vienna temps,
although an aside, is something I need to follow up more.
London has a UHI, but it doesn't mean any more warming in
the 20th century!
Hope all is well with you.
Cheers
Phil
PS Attached another paper - has some nice photos!
