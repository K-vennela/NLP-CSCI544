Comrades,
The impressive growth of the Party continues with the formation of 2 brand
new chapters of the NSM. We formally recognize the two new branches of the
NSM in the Nation of Spain, and the other here in the U.S. in Northern
Idaho.
Spain's Division of the NSM joins our International Chapters in various
Nations such as Russia, New Zealand, England (British Free Corps), Sweden,
etc. We welcome our Comrades in Spain to the NSM. Contact the NSM in Spain

The North Idaho Chapter is led by the former Nebraska unit Leader for the
NSM, therefore the Leadership of this branch of the Party brings his prior
Leadership & experience with him to the Northwest. Contact NSM North Idaho

The NSM intends to strengthen our ranks in both the Northwest and Southwest.
The Arizona NSM chapter is spearheading our efforts in the SW, and now we
are taking the fight to America's Northwest in Northern Idaho.
The battle for Race and Nation rages on...
