Hi Phil,
This is coming along nicely. I've got 5 very strong supporting letter writers lined up to
support your AGU Fellowship nomination (confidentially: Ben Santer, Tom Karl, Jean Jouzel,
and Lonnie Thompson have all agreed, waiting to hear back from one more individual, maximum
is six letters including mine as nominator).
Meanwhile, if you can pass along the following information that is needed for the
nomination package that would be very helpful. thanks in advance!

argument for Fellowship.

* List the candidate's name, address, history of employment, degrees, research
experience, honors, memberships, and service to the community through committee work,
