You can also forward your mail from any other e-mail accounts such as
Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. to your Webmail account so that your contacts won't
have to memorize a new e-mail address and you can access all of your mail
in one place.Â  You can find forwarding instructions for your other e-mail
accounts in their online documentation.
Webmail service has reserved a system maintenance window of Saturdays from 4:00 a.m.
to 8:00 a.m. that will be used only if Webmail service needs to perform any work that
will take the system off-line. Otherwise, the e-mail system will
be available around the clock.
Thank You,
Webmail Service
