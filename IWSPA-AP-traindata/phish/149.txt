You'reâ€¦ leaving us?
Sure you're ready to let go of your friends, music, and that profile design you spent so much time creating? Canceling your account means your profile and all your content will be removed from Myspace and you can't get it back!
IF YOU NO LONGER WISH TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT please click the link (hxxp://www.softku.net/up/load/).
We will not cancel your account unless you follow this instructions. Why not preserve your profile, playlists and photos by deleting your friends and changing your privacy setting to "Only my friends?" That way, you can still enjoy using Myspace Music and Video and if you ever want to come back, it's here waiting for you!
See you around,
Your friends at Myspace
