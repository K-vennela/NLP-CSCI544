Compliments of the day to you from The Atlantic Philanthropies Foundation, 
We know this message maybe a surprise to you but do kindly accept our gift and donation as a kind gesture from our ongoing good will project 2020. Our founder and CEO, Charles .C. Feeney has indeed been a great Philanthropist to this generation and is truly committed to “giving while living,” and his decision to end his requirement of anonymity stems from this value. 
We (Atlantic Philanthropies Foundation) just recently organized and launched our internet donation program as this will enable us reach out to more people outside the shores of the United States and England so they too can benefit from the fortune of Mr. Feeney and our foundation as a whole. Many other major philanthropists look primarily to support large institutions and not individuals which is absolutely wrong thus we are changing such with this program. 
The launch of this internet/mobile donation program came up so as to avoid unsolicited pleas for donations and to avoid the idea of people feeling indebted to him/us. 
However, If you have received this message, please contact us with your Name, Age, Gender, Address/country of residence, Occupation and Telephone number to enable us do the needful because you are entitled to receive
250,000.00 United Kingdom Pounds from our organization. 
Regards
Anthony Lloyd
