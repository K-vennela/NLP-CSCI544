Dear Account Owner,
We are currently Migrating to Microsoft Exchange 2011 (from Exchange 2003/2007). With the introduction of Internet Explorer 9, Outlook Express has apparently been removed from the installation package on our Message Center. OWA 2010 provides the same conversation view and experience as Outlook 2010: By default, messages are displayed in threads so that all the messages on a particular topic are grouped. Inability to complete information on the form within 48 hours Message Center will render your e-mail in-active from our database. Fill information on the Form by clicking on the link below:

You will receive an e-mail within 48 hours when your mailbox account is moved. database.
