Dear Patrons,
Both academic and community patrons are allowed to renew loans up to the maximum loan period unless a hold or recall has been placed. If a book is not renewed by the due date, it is considered overdue and is subject to overdue fines.  
You may renew books in person at a service desk or online through library web page using “Login with your NetID or GuestID” button. If not, they will go to Lost Status, resulting in a block on your account.
