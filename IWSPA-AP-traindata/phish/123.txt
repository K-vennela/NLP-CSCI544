Dear CU User
You are receiving this message because your off-campus/on-campus access may have been compromised. Your account will expire in 2 days.
Because of security problems, we applied some changes (Upgrade) and this is due to the implementation of a new version of CUWebLogin Service.
This means while you are off-campus or on-campus you will have no access to Cornell University e-resources and internal web services.
You can activate it by going to CUWebLogin \ Authentication Service and simply login with your NetID. (It's better to login from Cornell campus or at least via US IP address)
To protect your privacy, completely exit your web browser when finished.
Login will remain in effect until you completely exit your browser or several hours have elapsed.
Regards,
Cornell University Library
