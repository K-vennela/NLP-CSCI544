I will like you to take care of this personally, I have just been informed that we have had an offer accepted to complete an acquisition that we have been negotiating privately for some time now, In line with the terms agreed, we will need to make a down payment of 40% of their total. Which will be $18,000.
Until we are in a position to formally announce the acquisition I do not want you discussing it with anyone, any questions please email me.
Can you confirm if this wire can go out this today or if you can visit the bank to make a cash deposit?
Note; I can't take calls right now, therefore i will appreciate a swift email correspondence.
