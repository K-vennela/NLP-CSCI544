Dear Student,
I would like to invite you personally to become a part of our team.
Did you know it is possible to get paid just for giving your opinion in focus groups?Â 
Marketing is a crucial ingredient of any company's success in today's market place.
To compete with each other, businesses are spending billions and billions of dollars each year on market research, studying your opinions as a consumer.
With companies spending more and more of their budgets on advertising, your opinion is becoming extremely valuable.
Giving your opinion means those companies can gauge your immediate response to their new products or marketing initiatives.
You will always be paid and for your time. Plus your participation directly affects the products and services you use every day.
Knowing that they won't get our help for free, companies are willing to pay people like you good money (up to $150 an hour) for their opinions because they know they will generate even more profits for themselves.
You can fill in those marketing forms online over the Internet in the comfort of your own home or work place, so that you can register and participate at a time convenient to you.
Participate in a focus group in your area and earn up to $600/day in your spare-time.
A focus group is an opinion-seeking panel discussion where consumers are asked to share their ideas about new products or services. It can be brainstorming in front of a white board; tasting new beverages and helping to name them; and looking at ads and saying what they make you think of.
Groups usually consist of 8 to 10 people who join in a discussion led by a professional moderator. Often the participants in each group have common traits, experiences, or characteristics that allow the discussions to be interesting and informative.
If you are interested just reply to my email.
Best Regards,
Peter Hill
