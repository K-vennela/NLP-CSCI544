ABSA takes stringent steps to ensure that only you (or someone authorised by you) can gain access to your accounts. That is why we are introducing Approve-it™, a new and exciting internet banking security feature that will be available to customers from Wednesday, 22 August 2012.
Approve-it™ is a more secure means of authentication because it allows ABSA clients to accept, reject or suspend internet banking transactions via their cellphone. You are required to upgrade your internet banking now or visit your nearest branch, failure to do this can lead to hackers hacking into your account.
