Dear: Account Owner,
Our records indicate that you are enrolled in the Cornell University Employee electronic W-2 Program. As a result, you do not receive a paper W-2 by mail but instead receive e-mail notification that your online W-2 (i.e. "electronic W-2") is prepared and ready for viewing.
Your W-2 is ready for viewing under Employee Self Service. Click here to login: <<link>>
If you have trouble logging in to Employee Self Service at the link above, please contact your Payroll Department for support.
If you would like to un-enroll in the electronic W-2 Program, please log on to Employee Self Service at the link above and go to the W-2 Delivery Choice webpage and follow the instructions.
